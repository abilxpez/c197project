    "text": "Mr. Speaker, if the gentlewoman will yield, it might be of interest in the context that you have just established in regard to the minimum wage to note that the State of Hawaii already has a minimum wage at $5.25. We were an economy in Hawaii based on agriculture. We have moved into one of the most service-oriented economies it is possible to have; that is to say, a dependence on travel and tourism.Yet the argument is always made that if you are in a service economy, you have to keep wages at an absolute minimum. If you are in an agriculture economy, you have to keep wages at an absolute minimum. Yet the prosperity of the State of Hawaii has been based upon the fact that we recognized that people who are working, families that have to work, are best able not just to survive, but to prosper, when they are able to earn more than just a living wage, more than just an adequate wage, but a wage which enables them to fully participate in the economy.That economy is invested in by the very people who are doing the work. The money stays in the area where it is earned. It is not taken by multinational companies, by international companies, elsewhere. It is not moved into a global economy as such.That money earned in that State, whether it is Connecticut, whether it is in Hawaii, whether it is anyplace, whether it is in Georgia, in Cobb County, in Mr. Gingrich's home district, that money stays in that district. That money is invested in that district. Small business people make money in that district as a result of it.Those kinds of wages, the minimum wage, in service oriented jobs, when it is earned, is spent in the clothing store to buy shoes for the children right there in the local community. That is where it goes. The small investor, the small businesses, are the direct beneficiary of the raise in the minimum wage.",

    "title": "DISCUSSION OF 1997 BUDGET",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I wish I could say it was a pleasure to be here today, but I intend to discuss the 1997 budget today.Mr. Speaker, you may recall that I analyzed the 1996 budget activity in the context of an extended debate that took place on this floor, and in the other body, and you may recall, Mr. Speaker, that I invoked Members from the other body, like Mr. Hollings and Mr. Dorgan, covering the full range of opinions certainly in the Democratic Party. I indicated in that discussion that I had in conjunction with the Congressional Record in 1996 that there was no such thing as a balanced budget being prepared, let alone put forward in 1996, and we have the same situation today.Mr. Speaker, I do not doubt that it is very important for Mr. Dole to resign from the Senate to run as citizen and/or candidate Dole, because I do not think that in his role as Senator, let alone majority leader, that he would have the opportunity to have much credibility in the way of putting forward a balanced budget amendment, let alone putting forward a balanced budget for 1997.My fundamental point, Mr. Speaker, is that the budget that will be presented to us shortly, possibly this week, and be dispatched as quickly as possible, as opposed to 1996, dispatched as quickly as possible because it is not a balanced budget.Now, my good friend, my good and dear friend I would say, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Kasich], will come down, and he is an engaging individual. When I state my affection and friendship for him, Mr. Speaker, you know that it is a feeling that is genuine on my part. I value his friendship and I have genuine affection for him as an individual, but he has an impossible task. I grant he is probably the best one to try to put it forward.As you know, Mr. Speaker, he is an avuncular person, even as yourself, and he will come down on the floor, and with his engaging smile and his wit and rhetoric, we will put the best possible face on the fact that this is not a balanced budget document. It is not balanced for 1997, it most certainly is not going to be balanced for the year 2002.The reason I am taking the special order time, Mr. Speaker, with the budget, is that given the rules of the House it is virtually impossible to have any kind of lengthy discussion that would illuminate for the public and for the Members exactly what the budget is all about. Most of this takes place in a hearing room, in the Committee on the Budget hearings, and in staff work that is being done, discussions between the House and the other body with respect to a conference on the budget. Suffice to say, and I will for the Record, and would be happy to engage, as I did previously when we discussed the 1996 budget, be happy to engage anyone from the Republican side or from the Democratic side, because the budget being prepared from the Democratic side does not balance either. The difference is that we can count, I can count.As you know, Mr. Speaker, I would like to see the budget deficit disappear, but I think we should take a much longer period of time to do it so that we do not endanger the economy. I think that, interestingly enough, considering the labels that are put out about liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans or conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans, whatever these labels are, that I think the Federal Reserve, Mr. Greenspan's approach has been that the economy should be prevented from slipping into either recession or depression or slipping into a phase of inflation or hyperinflation. I think the stock market reflects this.The fact is that the growth in the economy is such that with a judicious approach to deficit cutting, we could keep the economy robust and reduce the deficit. This is, in fact, what President Clinton has accomplished. I know this is a source of great distress to those who predicted disaster with the Clinton budget, as presented in 1992 and 1993, but the fact is that the deficit has been cut considerably both in percentage terms and in real dollars for 3 years running now, something which has not happened since the end of World War II.So the President, not having the benefit of a Congress which is supportive of him in the majority; that is to say, a Republican Congress before him, has accepted the admonition of the majority to utilize the Congressional Budget Office figures in order to present to the public the idea of what would constitute numbers sufficient to have a balanced budget.In that role; that is to say, of a President who is faced with a Congress that wants to balance the budget utilizing the Congressional Budget Office figures, he accepted that ultimately in 1996. His priorities were different. As a result of the priorities within those priorities were, the President vetoed various elements of the budget and the budget was ultimately settled in a series of confrontations, a series of recriminations and arguments back and forth as to who was doing what and why.In the course of events, the Government was closed on various occasions and generally it was seen as a kind of sorry affair all the way around. Nonetheless, my point here is recounting that today is that we will not see that again, apparently, in 1997. We will go through the same series of illusions, using somewhat different numbers, but we will come to a much more rapid conclusion. The reason we will come to the more rapid conclusion is that we will not have the opportunity this year to go through--if the gentleman from Michigan would step to the microphone, I will be happy to yield at an appropriate point.Mr. Speaker, if Mr. Smith will grant me just a moment or two more to make the fundamental of my case, then I will be happy to yield to him. Always a pleasure to see him. In fact, he was one of the few people, as I mentioned previously, Mr. Speaker, who was willing to engage in a dialog and a colloquy on the question of the budget, and I value his input and exchange.As I indicated, Mr. Speaker, in 1996, if you will recall, we went through weeks actually, not just hours or days of discussion but weeks of discussion, and in the course of that discussion I was on the floor reviewing the budget, and I will do so again for 1997. My fundamental premise is this, that just as there was only the illusion of a balanced budget proposal, whether single year or multiyear, in 1996, there will be only the illusion presented this year. It will be strictly for political consumption and will not amount to anything worth the paper that it is written on in such elaborate fashion.I have here, Mr. Speaker, in my hand, and I will not have extensive charts down on the floor, I think the report speaks for itself, it is the concurrent resolution on the budget, fiscal year 1997, a report of the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives to accompany the Congressional Resolution 178 setting forth the congressional budget of the United States Government for the fiscal years 1997 through 2002, and it has additional minority and dissenting views.Now, this document runs some 450-plus pagers, 455 pages or so, and it is a very interesting document. It takes 44 pages, which is the first 44, takes 44 pages to get to the actual budget, when we actually get to the fiscal year budget for 1997. It is preceded on the page 43 with the end of politics as usual. This, I take it, is not exactly an attempt at humor on the part of the Committee on the Budget, the Committee on the Budget not being known for its sense of humor, other than in the person of, as I said, the aforementioned chair of the Committee on the Budget, but in the end of politics as usual, functions by function description, it says, ``The discussions that follow describe the budget resolution's recommended priorities for the fiscal years 1997 through 2002.''Now, it took us 44 pages to get there. We went through everything, including attacking corporate subsidies, economic assumptions of the budget resolution, the Clinton crunch, Americans' anxiety about their economic future, quite a rhetorical set-to in the first 44 pages. But what do we have then on page 44?Well, it says at the end of each function, ``Additional provisions with budgetary effects are mentioned.'' Mentioned, Mr. Speaker. I am going to get into a little more detail. The discussions that follow reflect the assumptions underlying the House Committee on the Budget's recommendations concerning the funding priorities for programs in each function.The actual changes for the programs fall under the authority of the authorizing and appropriating committees with jurisdiction over the programs.Let me explain very briefly, for those Members who may not be fully familiar with the budget process and those members of the public which may follow the Congressional Record on this who may not be totally familiar with it, once the Committee on the Budget makes its recommendations, it provides through that recommendation a kind of game plan for us in the House and the other body, a game plan for the Congress.Then the various committees in the Congress, whether they are authorizing committees or whether they are appropriating committees, authorizing meaning the program committees, the subject matter committees, and the Committee on Appropriations and its subcommittees, those who provide the money for the functions that are approved and authorized, they put the actual numbers and programs behind the Committee on the Budget recommendations.So with that in mind, what do we get to? We hear from Mr. Dole, Mr. Clinton, Mr. Kasich, Mr. Sabo, heartfelt and I will say totally sincere admonitions to us to arrive at a balanced budget. Well, as I indicated, I think that can be done. I think it will take a lot longer period than 1997 to 2002, and I need only look at the actual budget document itself to come up with proof of that.Let us examine what it actually says on page 44 of the budget resolution. Fiscal year 1997 through 2002, the deficit starting in 1997 will be--and these are estimates, they could go up or down. We realize that, but this is the best guess. And it is an informed guess by the Committee on the Budget and utilizing the congressional budget figures, and I take them at their word on this. And for conversation's sake, I will agree that these are the numbers that are under discussion and upon which we will vote--$163 billion deficit in 1995; 1996, it was $150 billion. The 1995 figure was down from the figures previous to that. You may recall during the last years of Mr. Bush's administration, the figures were 250 and above, between 250 and 300 billion. The number 163 then was progress. It may be too high for some people but unless you want to literally amputate the economy in order to achieve a balanced budget, this is certainly within the range of acceptability. It certainly has been reflected, that acceptability has been reflected in the conservative bodies, if you will, of financial opinion in this country as manifested in the policies of the Federal Reserve and the response of the stock exchange. So we had 163 billion, down considerably from the 250 to 290 billion plus of previous years; 1996, 150; 1997, the estimate is 147.This is a deficit I am citing. It is not something I am making up. I am taking this directly from page 44 under the column line deficit/surplus. Either it is a deficit or a surplus. This is the deficit. We get deficits in 1998, 1999, the year 2000, 2001, going from 147 to 142 to 114 to 87 to 39, certainly progress, then suddenly, as if by magic, Mr. Speaker, in the year 2002, we get a plus 3 billion, $3.185 billion.To me it is like watching a television show I saw recently, I think it was called the Wonderful World of Magic. This is the wonderful world of congressional budgeting. When someone is sawed in half, I saw this again, that is one of the oldest tricks, sawing a, generally a young woman in half, we do not really saw her in half. You have the illusion of her being sawed in half. She waves from one end, and the box is split in half and the feet are wiggling at the other end. Then the box is brought back together again and magically she reappears. That knife that went through that body apparently was an illusion.Well, the deficit cutting knife that is going through the deficit here between the years 1997 and 2002 is an illusion. Because suddenly, she is whole, the budget is whole, the budget has been balanced in 2002. Yet what happens then between 1997 and the year 2002, we have had an accumulated deficit of 528 billion. But magically, after that 528 billion in increasing deficit has occurred, suddenly, 528 billion later we achieve a $3 billion surplus for that 1 year. After that the deficit explodes again.Mr. Speaker, surely you can see and surely Members can see and surely the public, upon reading this document, will see that this is a game that is being played, a ballet with the books, a budget that is in name, a budget balancing act which is in name only, an act, yes, but certainly not balanced.I see the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Smith] has taken the rostrum down on the floor and I presume would like to have some discussion. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.",

    "title": "DISCUSSION OF 1997 BUDGET",
    "text": "Thank you very much. I appreciate it.As usual, Mr. Smith has been very forthright in his presentation, and I am appreciative of that. However, I would hope, Mr. Speaker, that you would consider what has been said during this colloquy, which I hope was at least informative, if not illuminating, and in the process then think about what Mr. Smith said.We know what he would prefer. He would prefer the deficit to disappear more quickly, and the reason that I find the notion amusing is I would prefer to be able to dunk a basketball, but I probably would have to pay a lot more in taxes. But I do not think that is going to happen. I mean it is an interesting thing to think about. In fact, I thought about it a lot in my life. I look at that basket up there, and I think, you know, it would be interesting to be able to dunk the ball. But it is a fantasy, and the difference between, I think, a sane person and someone who is steeped in illusion is to know the difference between fantasy and reality.It is a fantasy, and by Mr. Smith's own calculations it is a fantasy, to believe that we are really going to balance the budget in 5 years' time, or 7 years' time, because we have not taken into account where we borrowed the money to be able to put the numbers on the page to pretend that we were balancing the budget. Or we have imagined savings that somehow are going to take place like a balloon payment.You notice I mentioned the phrase balloon payment because I think that is as close as the average person would come to be able to relate their own budget, say their own mortgage, to what is taking place here in the Congress.I take no pleasure in going through this. On the contrary. I am glad Mr. Smith was down here so that it does not look at if it is just something I am conjuring up in order to take up time or to try and make some remarks that can be seen as very smart and sophisticated and dismissive of the genuine problem that exists with respect to the deficit. On the contrary. I would take what Mr. Smith said very much to heart.If you recall, if I recall correctly, he stated something: We should do it more gradually. Well, say 7 years was gradually to him. Well, maybe it would take 17. After all, we take 30 years to pay a mortgage on a home. In many instances we take 5 or 6 years to pay a car, we take some months or even years to pay off an appliance. It seems to me that if we are talking about the economic stability of the United States of America, to put a 30-year timetable or a 15-year timetable on paying down our deficit so that our economy stays stable, in fact stays robust and growing, that inflation stays in check, and interest rates remain low, and confidence high, that that would be an excellent use of our time vis-a-vis the growth capacity and possibilities of the U.S. economy.So there is no need to go through this kind of a charade with the budget unless we are trying to score political points and not deal realistically with the question of the budget and balancing it.Let me further state then at this point a subject that we got into very briefly; that is to say Mr. Smith and I got into it very briefly: How do you balance the budget when you are borrowing against Social Security, the so-called surplus in Social Security? And parenthetically, Mr. Speaker, let me say that that is not really a surplus. What we are doing now is what the average person thinks about when they put their savings together. They save now in order to be able to draw upon it in the future when it is needed.Now, the rough parallel to that is the Social Security System. We are paying into Social Security more than we take out presently because we know that in the future those funds will be called upon to be paid out. More people will be drawing upon Social Security with less people paying into it, we will have to make adjustments at some point in order to take that into account. Now, presumably the economy will grow, the percentage that may be taken in your Social Security tax, your payroll tax, et cetera, may increase in absolute numbers because the economy grows.All of those things can be guessed at, taken into account, but nonetheless the general proposition is, is that the Social Security trust fund must take in more money than it pays out as it goes along in order to be able to meet the requirements that Social Security will have to meet sometime in the next century in the early part of the century.If that is the case, and we are borrowing from Social Security trust fund and other trust funds, principally Social Security, if we are borrowing from them and have no plan to pay it back, because I think Mr. Smith agreed that nowhere in the 1997 budget projections through the next 5 years is there a plan to pay back Social Security, now, Mr. Speaker, if you and I borrowed money from ourselves and had no plan to pay it back, I do not think either of us would feel that that money somehow would magically appear in the year 2002.All that being said, Mr. Speaker, the borrowing, the deficit rising, no plan to pay it back to the Social Security System, how then is it possible to claim that the budget will be balanced in 2002? How is that possible and at the same time have a tax cut that will take revenues out of the system?Does it not make sense to you, Mr. Speaker, that if you are borrowing money in order in order to mask a deficit, that if you have a tax cut, which in fact increases the amount of money that will not be going to the Treasury, in addition to what you are borrowing, you are actually increasing the deficit? you are actually increasing the deficit even more.This is why I oppose this idea of cutting taxes while you say you are balancing the budget. I have no objection to a tax cut if the tax cut is not couched in terms of balancing the budget. Surely we have been through this before.Mr. Speaker, I have no objection to tax cuts as such. Quite the opposite. I would like to see tax incentives. I would like to see, for example, and I think it is well known, I believe that we should have a business meal entertainment deduction increase. I would like to see it at 100 percent. I have no objection to supply-side economics, as such, when we can justify it, deliberate it, and discuss it on an issue-by-issue basis. I think that I could make a case that the business meal entertainment deduction is a job provider, is a job generator; that we could find labor and management on the same side of the table on that. I think the spousal deduction for travel ought to be put forward as an incentive to boosting the economy.I think we will find, Mr. Speaker, in our home States that tourism, entertainment, and travel constitute one of the top three business endeavors in our States. Tourism, travel, and entertainment is the top money producer and job generator in some 13 States, and it is one of the top three in 30-plus States.I am willing, Mr. Speaker, not only willing but eager, to have a discussion about where we can have tax incentives and tax breaks, and discuss what constitutes, as I said with the gentleman from Michigan previously, what constitutes welfare. Welfare is not just something that comes with a single mother and children. Welfare can come to corporations, too.I notice that Mr. Trump was not hurting for people to come to his aid and rescue when he needed all the benefits of corporate welfare, when he was running through his various real estate machinations in New York and Atlantic City and elsewhere. Business has these incentives and breaks all the time.I think individuals ought to be able to finance their education. We cannot exist in the 21st century without a good education, and I think that would be a good investment, if we can find a way to provide tax incentives and breaks to accomplish that. I think we would benefit from that.The argument against that is the immediate consequences of some incentives and cuts and breaks, whatever we want to call them, may be a drop in the Treasury. I would argue that. We would have to determine whether or not, for example, with business meal entertainment deductions and the spousal travel deduction, if we were able to increase that, I think more business would be done, and I could make an argument that revenues would increase. This is essentially the supply-side argument that took place in the 1980's.However, if we take it in such a broad brush that it is to cover everything, then I think we run into the trouble that this budget runs into, that we cannot make the numbers add up. That is where I think the difficulty occurs here. I would like to think, and I certainly hope that I am a reasonable person who takes his oath as seriously as anyone does in all of the Congress, and I believe every one of my colleagues and yourself, Mr. Speaker, takes himself or herself quite seriously when it comes to carrying out their duty under their oath of office.As a result of that, I would like to think that while we may have disagreements as to the precise way in which we can accomplish our goals, that nonetheless, the discussion as to how to arrive at that is not only very valuable, but crucial to determining whether or not we are actually going to accomplish the goal. The goal here is ultimately to balance the budget while keeping the economy robust, and to see to it that the average American throughout the spectrum of opportunity and individual capacities and abilities does the very best that they can nationwide. That is what we do.Mr. Speaker, it used to be a point of pride in this country that people earned a good living, that they could end up better than where they started. Now we seem to see an ethos developing of cost-cutting, which means people-cutting. People are being rewarded at the top of the corporate hierarchy for being able to cut jobs out, and to see to it that people are maligned simply for trying to get an increase in the minimum wage.I do not think this is the atmosphere in which we want to discuss something like balancing the budget, because if the only way to balance the budget is to take it on the backs of children or on people trying to better themselves in life, that is no solution. To me, that runs counter to my understanding of what the American dream is all about.So in that context, then, it seems to me that what is very important here is that we discuss what is actually happening. What actually is happening is that the budget is gradually being balanced, as it should be, without endangering the economy. The deficit declines for the fourth consecutive year in 1996. This is the first time it has happened since the Truman administration. I am going over some of the elements that I have cited before in a little more detail.The traditional Congressional Budget Office baseline projections include discretionary spending at caps established in 1993 and show the deficit rising after 1996 and reaching $210 billion in 2002. This is $18 billion lower than the December projection of this year, and $80 billion lower than April of 1995. In other words, these numbers can change with the wind, but the wind has to be blowing in the right direction.The direction of the budgetary wind is this: That we have a prudent understanding of what it takes to have the budget balance. To simply do it arbitrarily, as is done in this 1997 budget, and to think about the idea of cutting taxes at the same time that you are trying to achieve a balance in the budget and a reduction of the deficit, more than a reduction, the balancing of deficit spending, I think is beyond credibility.I would indicate, Mr. Speaker, because I have had some considerable time to discuss it, and perhaps not all of our colleagues have heard the whole discussion, the hypothesis that I am putting forward, the thesis that I am putting forward, is that if you have as the budget, and the document I am referring to is the budget of the majority, the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives, if we have, as the Committee on the Budget indicates, deficits for every year from 1997 through 2001, and then suddenly find a surplus in the year 2002, it is just not credible. Try and sell that in Ravenswood, WV.I talked with friends there today. I said I was going to make a presentation today. They were interested in what I was going to say, what my premises were going to be. I just asked whether or not this sounded credible, that you could have deficits, declining as they might be right up to 2001, and suddenly come up with a surplus in 2002, and then from 2003 on just watch the deficit expand again.I hope that we are not going to be subject, Mr. Speaker, to Member after Member coming to the well of the House and regaling us with stories about their children and their grandchildren and all this mawkish, overblown rhetoric about how they are so concerned with their children and grandchildren, presumably none of the rest of us are, which I find a little bit farfetched, but rather, if we are so concerned about children and grandchildren, maybe we should be a little more honest with them right now.My fundamental point is this budget does not balance. The budget in 1998 does not balance. The budget in 1999 does not balance. The budget in 2000, 2001, it does not balance. How is it going to balance in 2002? Even if it does on paper, how long is it going to last? Merely the time it takes to say it: ``Oh, the budget is balanced''? Well, it was balanced, because it was balanced when I said it, but now we are 3 seconds beyond that time and it is not balanced anymore. But we balanced it for that moment, on paper, just to go through that allusion. I do not think it is worthy of this Congress to do it.So, Mr. Speaker, I think if we look at 1996 and what we went through, we did not have a balanced budget but we did manage to cut the deficit. We did manage to cut the rate of the deficit. We did hold inflation down. We held steady on interest rates. I think on the whole, then, the President's priorities were met. The majority ultimately voted for a budget that was more in line with the President's priorities, so the President is entitled to credit for sticking to a position with respect to the rate of the deficit reduction under the premises established by the majority in the Congress, the Republican majority, and it worked.Now the President is coming forward again, saying that he would like to see these priorities carried forward on education, on Medicare, on Medicaid and the environment, and that he has certain standards that he desires to maintain under pain of exercising his veto. That is his constitutional right. In fact, it is his obligation as President, even as President Bush and President Reagan before him exercised the veto dozens and dozens of times, most of which we were unable to overcome when we were the majority here in the House of Representatives or the majority in the Senate. They prevailed. That is our constitutional system.It is supposed to be hard to pass legislation in the United States of America. What many people call gridlock is the wheels of government turning precisely the way the Framers of the Constitution intended for them to turn. The Congress of the United States makes policy, yes, but only if it achieve the approbation of the executive. The executive can prevail against the legislative body only if the executive can be sustained in the legislative body. We have the judicial side to see to it that we both keep a proper balance. That is our system.Mr. Speaker, I do not find it regrettable in the least that it is difficult to pass items like the budget. What I find regrettable is that we seem to be passing it so easily this week, Mr. Speaker. That is what bothers me. This is the single most important document with respect to the legislative business and what follows from it that we will have before us this year. It certainly is the most important piece of legislation before the election which is to take place in November. As a result, it seems to me we should be devoting considerable time to it.I appreciate the fact that the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Smith] came down and was willing to spend some time discussing it. I think the import of the arguments that he made essentially supports my position. Of course, I can make that statement now because he has left the floor and cannot taken an opposing position to that, but I think I can extract from what he said at least a reasonable basis for saying, as I have, and indicate again to you at this moment, that we need to be much more gradual about it. To that degree, the President seems to be taking the right approach. He has accepted the will of the majority with respect to the premises upon which it bases its balanced budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office.It is not necessary for me to explain to you, Mr. Speaker, what the Congressional Budget Office is. Suffice it to say that every legislative body relies upon individuals, experts in their field, to make recommendations and to draw upon statistics and information made available to them from their various professional fields and backgrounds in order to complete a picture. In this instance, it is a picture of what the economy is like and what we can expect.This does not mean they are going to be absolutely correct in every instance, but all individual families, all companies, all businesses, all organizations, in fact, all nations, have to utilize the best brains that they have available, accumulate the most knowledge that they can, and try to draw reasonable conclusions as to what the future might bring so they can make decisions. That is all the Congressional Budget Office does with respect to the budget. It makes the best estimate that it can based upon the premises that are agreed upon.In this instance, Mr. Speaker, we have agreed upon premises which, by definition of the budget, do no add up to a balance. I have no objection to passing this budget, Mr. Speaker, with the admonition that we should take up the President's disagreement with respect to the priorities. I voted for the budget previously, and despite my own misgivings, so it is not a question of whether we should vote on a budget, it is question of what the priorities should be.I have no objection to saying that this could be a step in the direction of balancing the budget, if we have the President's priorities involved in it. I do object to us indicating to the American people that somehow this is going to lead to a balanced budget, just as I object to the idea of going through this illusion and farce, which apparently is going to take place in the other body, about passing a balanced budget amendment. The balanced budget amendment will no more achieve a balanced budget than this document does.This does not achieve a balanced budget, and neither does passing the balanced budget amendment accomplish anything of the kind, any more than vows in a marriage guarantee that there will be happiness and prosperity in it. You can have the intention, but unless you put behind it the activity which will ensure that happy consequence, then you cannot claim that it will happen.What I am saying here is if we put forward a budget that says, yes, we will cut spending and we will cut spending in a way that will continue to reduce the deficit over time and we hope at some point then to be able to reach balance, then that is all right. Not only is it all right, but that is the right way to do it.I mentioned a mortgage before. Let me draw the analogy for my colleagues here and for those who may be interested in the record.Just as you are not expected to have cash on hand to buy your house but, rather, you are expected to be able to make your payments, be able to meet your obligations over a period of time, then you can go forward with the purchase of that home and say that you own it. Do you actually own it? No. Because the bank owns it. We are going to have a mortgage-burning ceremony perhaps in 30 years.But that bank is making a bet. That bank is betting that you have the capability and the capacity to make those payments for that period of time. Think about it. Twelve times a month for 13 years. That is pretty good guessing. Perhaps it bespeaks a knowledge of finance and general economic trends that is fairly reliable.Now, that being the case, I think we need to do the same thing with this budget. Let us not con the American people into thinking for a moment that this document is moving toward balancing the budget in the year 2002. It is not true. It is not going to happen. That is irrefutable.On the contrary, he agreed with my premise. It is not going to be balanced because we do not take into account how we are going to pay for all of the money that we borrowed to presumably create the illusion of balancing this budget.What we can do is create over time an ability to pay, a robust economy that will enable us to gradually draw down the amount of the deficit with prudent spending, with a clear understanding of what programs we want to support and why we want to support them and how they benefit the American people, and over that lengthy period of time accomplish this goal. There is nothing not only wrong with that, that is the sensible, practical, reasonable way to do it, because it maximizes the opportunity for the great mass of American people to join in the prosperity, to be able to better themselves in what they want to accomplish for themselves and their family.So I stand here today, Mr. Speaker, I do not think a lonely voice or a single voice. I think I stand here enunciating fairly clearly for the American people, and I hope for my colleagues, most certainly, the idea that we should not utilize the budget process for political purposes merely because there is an election, but we should utilize our opportunity with this budget process to begin to make progress towards reducing the deficit, coming into balance, having the economy grow and seeing a robust, prosperous economy for all.Mr. Speaker, inasmuch as there is only a minute left, I want to thank you for your courtesy today in allowing me to speak and for sharing this time with me. I hope that I have made some contribution today. I intend to, in the future, towards reviewing the 1997 budget and reviewing the whole question of the budget deficit, the budget balance proposition, and seeing to it that all Americans now and in the future are able to enjoy a prosperous future.

    "title": "ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak out against granting most-favored-nation status to China. Many of my colleagues have discussed the various aspects of China's MFN status; I am going to concentrate on the issue of exporting forced labor manufactured products to the United States. The Chinese Government has not complied with the memorandum of understanding on prison labor between the United States and China also known as the MOU.In the MOU, the Chinese acknowledged that exporting forced labor products to the United States is illegal. Key provisions of the MOU state that China will promptly investigate companies or enterprises suspected of violating relevant regulations; they will furnish available evidence and information regarding suspected violations; and they will allow United States officials to visit the respective enterprises or companies.This violation should be important to any working American. Importing products made by convicted, forced or indentured labor in Chinese prison camps takes jobs away from Americans. The United States should not continue granting MFN status to China while it is exporting prison labor products. There are many examples of Chinese and United States companies deliberately violating the law.For example, the Customs Bulletin and Decisions published in the Federal Register on April 23, 1996, reports that certain iron pipe fittings are made using prison labor at the Tianjin Malleable Iron Factory also known as the Tianjin Tongbao Fittings Co., also known as the Tianjin No. 2 Malleable Iron Plant, also known as the Tianjin Secondary Mugging Factory, also known as the Tainajin No. 2 Prison. I'm sure you noticed that the prison goes by many names and is only one example of how the Chinese Government tries to mislead companies and countries on where exported manufactured products are being made.The March 1996 State Department report entitled ``China Human Rights Practices,'' states that cooperation with United States officials has stalled since mid-1995. ``As of the end of 1995, the authorities had not granted access to a prison labor facility since April 30th. * * * As in many Chinese workplaces, safety is a low priority. There are no available figures for casualties in prison industry.''Another example of exported prison labor can be found by examining the Chinese expandable graphite exports. The only mine in China which produces expandable graphite for export is a forced labor camp called the Beishu Laogai Detachment, also known as the Shandong Province Beishu Prison, the Shandong Province Beishu Shengjian Graphite Mine, the Beishu Graphite Mine, and recently the Qingdao Graphite Mine. Producing expandable graphite is dangerous because it involves the extensive use of sulfuric and chromic acid. Shipping records from 1992 to 1995 show that two major customers of the expandable graphite in the United States were the Asbury Graphite Company and China Enterprises.Let me refresh some of my colleagues' memories in the case they don't remember watching the June 1995 Tom Brokaw interview with Steven Riddle, CEO of the Asbury Graphite Co. in New Jersey. During the interview, Mr. Riddle admitted that his company was purchasing expandable graphite from Qingdao Mines, a forced labor camp. In addition, Mr. Riddle admitted that he sometimes worried that his company, Asbury Graphite was violating the law, but ``everybody tends to look the other way.'' We need to stop looking the other way. United States companies should not feel comfortable purchasing forced labor products from China. The U.S. Customs Agency needs to put its foot down and enforce the law.An interesting side note: The Beishu Laogai Detachment was unexpectedly visited on Christmas Day, 1994, by a reporter from the London Sunday Times, named Nick Rufford. He reported that ``Evidence of the use of forced labor was abundant. Inmates marched in double file. Trucks with `Beishu prison' stenciled on the sides in Chinese characters were parked inside the factory gates. Behind the plant stood a walled compound with watchtowers and guards.'' Mr. Rufford reported 3,500 tons of graphite from the mine was shipped to Britain last year.As many of my colleagues know, Amnesty International and other sources have provided ample documentation of the cruel and abusive practices common in Chinese prisons. That abuse, the restricted journals clearly show, is translated directly into hard currency earned in the export trade.For example, in a journal whose readership is restricted to prison officials, a writer laid out the brutal logic of using prison labor for export production: ``Prisoners have become commodity producers. they are cheap and concentrated. They produce labor intensive products.'' It is precisely the goods which fall into the labor intensive category that form the bulk of Chinese exports to the United States.The article also shows that it is common practice in China to forcibly retain so-called labor reform prisoners for indefinite periods beyond the expiration of their terms. the industrial advantages are explained clearly to prison administrators: ``Prisoners retained for in-camp employment * * * can not join labor unions, do not enjoy retirement benefits when they become old, and their wages and living standards are low.''These abuses seal the case against granting China MFN status. China does not play by the rules. China does not reciprocate the trade benefits we grant to them. Despite the fact that over one-third of China's exports are sold into the United States market, China's high tariffs and non tariff barriers limit access to the Chinese market for United States goods and services. Only 2 percent of United States exports are allowed into China. The result is a $34 billion United States trade deficit with China in 1995. This doesn't include any of the stolen intellectual property of the illegally smuggled guns. I strongly urge my colleagues that we no longer reward China's constant violations of agreements. Vote against granting MFN status to China.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Bentsen].(Mr. BENTSEN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BENTSEN. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 1975, the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act. H.R. 1975 would streamline our Federal royalty collection system by improving the management of royalties from Federal and outer continental shelf oil and gas leases.Currently, about $4.2 billion is collected annually by the Federal Government in mineral receipts--our Nation's third largest revenue source. However, reform of our Nation's royalty collection system has been needed for some time. H.R. 1975 achieves the goals set out by the administration, the States, and industry to provide simplicity and fairness in the partnership between the Federal Government and the leaseholders of Federal lands.Specifically, this legislation would establish a clear statute of limitations on royalty collection, expand existing delegation to States provisions, and set time limits on administrative appeal decisions. This legislation also provides marginal well relief by reforming royalty collections for low-production wells--an issue of great importance to my home State of Texas.At a time when we continue to see increasing reliance on oil imports, this legislation provides the necessary relief to enhance domestic production in both an economically efficient and environmentally sound way. In addition, H.R. 1975 would help Congress in its efforts to balance the budget by providing an additional $51 million in royalties over the next 7 years.H.R. 1975 is supported by the administration, a bipartisan delegation of Members from Congress as well as 14 of our Nation's Governors who represent most of our Federal onshore production. It is also supported by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission and industry trade associations representing our Nation's Federal lessees. I urge my colleagues to support royalty simplification and fairness by voting in favor of H.R. 1975.",

    "title": "HELIUM PRIVATIZATION ACT OF 1996",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise with regrets, acknowledging H.R. 3008, a bill to close the Federal helium program, will pass today. In these days of downsizing, it seems the time has come to terminate programs which appear to have outlived their usefulness like the Federal helium program.I want to note that I say appear, Mr. Speaker. Since 1925, when the Defense Department believed that dirigibles or blimps would be an integral part of our national defense, the Federal Government has managed a helium program. Today the Federal helium program continues to serve the needs of major Federal users of helium such as NASA and DOE laboratories, who are required to purchase helium from the Bureau of Mines.The Federal Government got involved in helium production at a time when there was no private helium production. Today, however, the private sector manufactures 90 percent of the world's helium. For this reason groups such as the National Taxpayers Union, the ``20/20'' TV program, the Interior Department inspector general, and the Heritage Foundation, an unlikely conglomeration, have called for its elimination.H.R. 3008, like its predecessor, H.R. 3967 in the 103d Congress, enjoys bipartisan support. While I did not support termination of the program, I recognize after several years of consideration Congress is poised to resolve the question of the helium program by terminating it. But I remain concerned that we have not done enough to aid the 200-plus employees in Amarillo, TX, who will lose their livelihood as consequence of our decision.The bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to sell off all the equipment, real property, refining facilities, and gradually sell off most of the crude helium currently stored in Amarillo, TX. Funds from the sale will be deposited in a helium fund established under the 1960 act, and will be available for various termination activities, including some employee benefits already authorized under law. Eventually the fund will be applied against the debt to reduce the deficit. This is, in any event, the hope.During the committee consideration of this bill, I offered an amendment to provide employee benefits in addition to those authorized under existing law so that the 200-plus employees in Amarillo, many of whom have built their careers on this program, would get the same kind of additional education and job placement assistance that we gave defense employees working at bases that were closed. These are people, Mr. Speaker, men and women, who through no fault of their own find themselves working for a Federal program targeted for downsizing and in fact elimination.My amendment would have given these people help in addition to what the Secretary has already authorized to provide, the same kind of help that we have provided, as I indicated, to many of the defense employees working at military bases scheduled for closure: job placement assistance, extended life and health insurance coverage, and the option to take an early retirement without penalty.Sadly, my Republican colleagues on the committee could not be persuaded to provide this type of much-needed aid. During committee debate, my friend and colleague from California [Mr. Calvert] argued that the Secretary already has the authority to provide these benefits. This is simply incorrect, Mr. Speaker.My amendment would have added authority necessary to enable the Secretary to extend health and life insurance coverage for 3 years beyond an employee's termination. The Secretary does not have the ability to provide this assistance under current law. My amendment would have allowed Federal helium employees access to the enhanced early retirement option, and current law does not provide for this protection. My amendment would have given Federal helium employees hiring preference Government-wide, not just in the Amarillo area as is provided under existing law.So, Mr. Speaker, my amendment failed. Even though I agreed with my good friend and colleague from Texas [Mr. Thornberry] that we did not need to terminate this program, I, and I believe he, could see that this bill would pass. So I tried to lessen the blow so that the helium workers might be able to find another Federal job, or if they served 20 years, they could take an early out and retire from civil service.As of now, this is not to be, Mr. Speaker. These activities would have been paid from the existing helium account and would have cost relatively pennies, especially in comparison to the costs of unemployment benefits. The Congressional Budget Office said that my amendment would have had no budgetary effect.It seemed only fair to offer this assistance to the innocent victims of our downsizing zeal, so that the employees who had nothing to do with the difficulties facing the program would not be left stranded by their Government. But my Republican colleagues could not see their way clear to help their fellow public servants in this instance, and so today I expect we will pass H.R. 3008 under suspension of the rules so we can praise ourselves for making Government smaller.We could have done so, Mr. Speaker, in a much more humane and compassionate manner. I will ask the other body to consider my amendment before we conclude the legislative process. Loyal workers in the helium program deserve no less.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "I thank the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Hefner] for yielding me the time.Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to be here today and particularly to follow the chair of our subcommittee, the gentleman from Colorado [Mr. Hefley], because I would like to echo his comments on the cooperation between the appropriations committee and the authorizing committee. In this particular instance, we are talking about quality of life, and I would like to follow then on the remarks of the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Hefner] as well.Unfortunately, the Department of Defense has come to rely upon us in Congress when it comes to budgetary matters with respect to quality of life. What happens is, on the procurement side, in the more exotic weapons systems, particularly those that cost a great deal of money, they push that part of the envelope right up to the edge, and then they count on Members of Congress to come through on questions of quality of life, whether it is barracks or family housing or what have you, child development centers, et cetera. And we have done that.I want to commend the gentleman from Colorado [Mr. Hefley] for his bipartisan approach on it, the chair of the subcommittee; and my good friend from North Carolina [Mr. Hefner] for seeing to it that these quality of life issues have not been abandoned.In particular, I can say in the area of the Pacific, we have dealt with Schofield Barracks and the renewal of barracks there, and we are very appreciative, and this year at Kaneohe for the Marine Barracks. General Krulak, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, called very, very happy to see that we were going to start the phasing in of the new barracks proposals at Kaneohe in the State of Hawaii.I will say that this has a further good effect. What this does is stop the competition for nonexistent rental housing between military families and civilian families. The result, the 6 years that I have been in office and the plan that I started out with and presented on a bipartisan basis, was that this would reduce rents, reduce the cost of living in Hawaii for civilian families and improve the quality of life for military families, I think a good result from that, and I am very grateful for it.I have two other points that I would like to make very briefly. One, as a way of improving this, I hope and I think the gentleman from Colorado [Mr. Hefley] has indicated that he has an interest in this, and other Republican members on our authorizing committee have indicated an interest in this, is that we start thinking about capital budgeting and start differentiating operating costs from capital costs, particularly using as a demonstration model perhaps quality of life issues in the military. We have started that.The gentleman from Colorado [Mr. Hefley] was instrumental in helping us put together legislation for public-private partnerships to see to it that we can get into capital expenditures. If we can differentiate capital expenditures from operating expenditures, I think we can make vast improvements in the quality of life area and demonstrate a way of moving toward more sensible spending patterns that will result not only in helping to balance the budget but in moving forward in a sensible way with our military budgeting.So I am appreciative to the gentleman from Colorado [Mr. Hefley], the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Hefner], to the gentlewoman from Nevada [Mrs. Vucanovich], and others who have helped support this issue.Finally, Mr. Chairman, let me say that when I was first elected in a special election in 1986, there was someone here who took me under his wing, that acted as a mentor to me, someone whom I believe to be an example of the true gentleman that exists in the House of Representatives, someone who will be more than missed, someone for whom I have the greatest possible respect, someone that we know and military families throughout the country will appreciate for decades to come because of his work at Fort DeRussy and Hale Koa to see that the recreation needs of our military are taken care of. All of us are going to miss with all of our hearts Representative Sonny Montgomery from Mississippi.",

Now, I would say, and I would hope you would agree, that the majority has not only very able, but extremely well-informed, experienced legislators on the Committee on National Security, of whom I can name two or three right now: Mr. Weldon, Mr. Hunter, and Mr. Cunningham. I can th1nk of just three offhand. And the minority has people like Mr. Spratt.Mr. Dellums, others I could name, Mr. Peterson of Florida, who are equally capable, and equally capable, by the way, of defending and rebutting on the question of national missile defense.But the Speaker has said he wants to bring forward a missile bill. Now, I do not think the Speaker knows any more about missiles than he knows about Hawaiian malasadas, and I do not think he knows much about malasadas, and I will spell that after this is over, but take it from me, it is a Portuguese donut, and I do not think he knows much about it. I think Leonard's knows all about it out in Honolulu.But that budget, if we are going to talk about spending and welfare, has to be looked at very hard. The Congressional Budget Office, as I understand it, came up with figures just to acquire this defense system, missile system, national missile defense, of between $30 and $60 billion. Now, that is a serious question; and we cannot hide behind the idea that somehow, if you are for it, you are for defense, if you are against it, you are against defense, when you have to put it in terms of what constitutes proper spending under the admonitions that you just enunciated.",

As you know, Burma is ruled by a brutal military dictatorship which rejects the mandate of the democratic elections of 1990.Although Aung San Suu Kyi is no longer under house arrest, the military regime has been stepping up its repressive measures against her and her party, the National League for Democracy. As the sixth anniversary of the democratic election approached, over 200 people were arrested. Recently, the regime released half of the detainees. These arrests were the latest example of the egregious human rights situation in Burma.Aung San Suu Kyi and members of the National League for Democracy did not give in to the fear of retribution. They held rallies these past two weekends and will continue to meet.I say to Anug San Suu Kyi, thank you for your courage and devotion to principle, you inspire all of us.

Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China.In September, 1995, I joined women from around the world at the United Nations Fourth World Conference in China. The Non- Governmental Organization (NGO) conference provided a platform for community organizations from around the world to influence their governments to move more quickly toward equal rights and human rights for women and girls. The NGO forum also provided women from around the world with a forum to highlight issues from their neighborhood, town, city, region, and country and brought participants together to discuss local, national, international solutions to these issues. The NGO conference was an overwhelming experience. From the moment that I first boarded the plane to China and during the conference there was an unspoken acknowledgment, a bond and an excitement between the conference participants. Tens of thousands of women from around the world together for one purpose--to accelerate the movement of governments toward equal human rights for women and girls. While we were strangers and did not all speak the same language or have the same customs, we all shared a unique understanding about our status as women. As women, we know what it means to be denied human rights because of our gender status. As women, we know what is means to be afraid of violence because we are not safe in our streets or in our homes. We know what is means to be denied equal access to reproductive and medical care. We know what is means to be denied a seat at the table when policy decisions are being made about our lives and rights. And we know that in over a dozen counties, through infanticide and dowry deaths, women and girls are killed because of their gender. The bond between women at the conference was also a reflection of the commitment that these thousands of women had to make to realize the changes that are necessary at the local, national and international level to assure that women have equal human rights. At the opening ceremony to the NGO conference NGO participants sang ``I'm going to fight for women's freedom, never turning back, never turning back.'' I think of these words and the conference and I am recommitted and energized to help my own community move forward more quickly toward equal human rights for women and girls.",

We were an economy in Hawaii based on agriculture. We have moved into one of the most service-oriented economies it is possible to have; that is to say, a dependence on travel and tourism.Yet the argument is always made that if you are in a service economy, you have to keep wages at an absolute minimum. If you are in an agriculture economy, you have to keep wages at an absolute minimum. Yet the prosperity of the State of Hawaii has been based upon the fact that we recognized that people who are working, families that have to work, are best able not just to survive, but to prosper, when they are able to earn more than just a living wage, more than just an adequate wage, but a wage which enables them to fully participate in the economy.That economy is invested in by the very people who are doing the work. The money stays in the area where it is earned. It is not taken by multinational companies, by international companies, elsewhere. It is not moved into a global economy as such.That money earned in that State, whether it is Connecticut, whether it is in Hawaii, whether it is anyplace, whether it is in Georgia, in Cobb County, in Mr. Gingrich's home district, that money stays in that district. That money is invested in that district. Small business people make money in that district as a result of it.Those kinds of wages, the minimum wage, in service oriented jobs, when it is earned, is spent in the clothing store to buy shoes for the children right there in the local community. That is where it goes. The small investor, the small businesses, are the direct beneficiary of the raise in the minimum wage.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for H.R. 1772, to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire certain interests in the Waihe'e Marsh for inclusion in the Oahu National Wildlife Refuge, introduced by my colleague from Hawaii, Representative Patsy Mink.The Waihe'e Marsh, also called the Kahalu'u wetland, is located on the windward side of Oahu. Acquisition of Waihe'e Marsh is vital to the integrity of the Oahu National Wildlife Refuge [Refuge]. The purpose of the refuge is to protect and manage a network of wetlands throughout Oahu for the recovery of endangered waterbirds, migratory birds, and other values of natural wetlands. Specifically, Waihe'e Marsh is identified as a priority wetland site in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's regional wetlands concept plan: Emergency Wetlands Resource Act [USFWS 1990]. Throughout Hawaii there has been a substantial cumulative loss of wetlands.I would like to point out to my colleagues in the House that the natural environment of Hawaii is one of our planet's most significant treasures. The islands are home to more unique species than any place of similar size on the Earth. Yet, Hawaii has the most alarming concentration of species teetering on the brink of extinction. While Hawaii makes up only 0.2 percent of the land area we account for nearly 75 percent of the Nation's historically documented plant and bird extinctions of the United States. Currently, more than one-fourth of the 959 animals and plants on the U.S. endangered and threatened species list come from Hawaii.Under H.R. 1772 Waihe'e Marsh would be rehabilitated and managed for the recovery and support of endangered Hawaiian waterbirds, such as the endangered Hawaiian Stilt, Hawaiian coot, Hawaiian moorhen and Hawaiian duck, which are all protected under the Endangered Species Act. Also, wetlands in Hawaii provide habitat for several species of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl which are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.I want to mention to my colleagues that the importance of Waihe'e Marsh is not limited to plants and animals. This has been an issue that has been worked from the grassroots. I commend all the hard work put in by the local communities. The Waihe'e Marsh is important for the surrounding communities because it naturally serves as a flood control holding area and the vegetation contributes to the control of shoreline erosion for nearby residential areas. Also, the marsh serves as a filter to protect water quality and coral reef communities in Kaneohe Bay.Mr. Speaker, this is a worthwhile piece of legislation that deserves the full support of all my colleagues.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak out against granting most-favored-nation status to China. Many of my colleagues have discussed the various aspects of China's MFN status; I am going to concentrate on the issue of exporting forced labor manufactured products to the United States. The Chinese Government has not complied with the memorandum of understanding on prison labor between the United States and China also known as the MOU.In the MOU, the Chinese acknowledged that exporting forced labor products to the United States is illegal. Key provisions of the MOU state that China will promptly investigate companies or enterprises suspected of violating relevant regulations; they will furnish available evidence and information regarding suspected violations; and they will allow United States officials to visit the respective enterprises or companies.This violation should be important to any working American. Importing products made by convicted, forced or indentured labor in Chinese prison camps takes jobs away from Americans. The United States should not continue granting MFN status to China while it is exporting prison labor products. There are many examples of Chinese and United States companies deliberately violating the law.For example, the Customs Bulletin and Decisions published in the Federal Register on April 23, 1996, reports that certain iron pipe fittings are made using prison labor at the Tianjin Malleable Iron Factory also known as the Tianjin Tongbao Fittings Co., also known as the Tianjin No. 2 Malleable Iron Plant, also known as the Tianjin Secondary Mugging Factory, also known as the Tainajin No. 2 Prison. I'm sure you noticed that the prison goes by many names and is only one example of how the Chinese Government tries to mislead companies and countries on where exported manufactured products are being made.The March 1996 State Department report entitled ``China Human Rights Practices,'' states that cooperation with United States officials has stalled since mid-1995. ``As of the end of 1995, the authorities had not granted access to a prison labor facility since April 30th. * * * As in many Chinese workplaces, safety is a low priority. There are no available figures for casualties in prison industry.''Another example of exported prison labor can be found by examining the Chinese expandable graphite exports. The only mine in China which produces expandable graphite for export is a forced labor camp called the Beishu Laogai Detachment, also known as the Shandong Province Beishu Prison, the Shandong Province Beishu Shengjian Graphite Mine, the Beishu Graphite Mine, and recently the Qingdao Graphite Mine. Producing expandable graphite is dangerous because it involves the extensive use of sulfuric and chromic acid. Shipping records from 1992 to 1995 show that two major customers of the expandable graphite in the United States were the Asbury Graphite Company and China Enterprises.Let me refresh some of my colleagues' memories in the case they don't remember watching the June 1995 Tom Brokaw interview with Steven Riddle, CEO of the Asbury Graphite Co. in New Jersey. During the interview, Mr. Riddle admitted that his company was purchasing expandable graphite from Qingdao Mines, a forced labor camp. In addition, Mr. Riddle admitted that he sometimes worried that his company, Asbury Graphite was violating the law, but ``everybody tends to look the other way.'' We need to stop looking the other way. United States companies should not feel comfortable purchasing forced labor products from China. The U.S. Customs Agency needs to put its foot down and enforce the law.An interesting side note: The Beishu Laogai Detachment was unexpectedly visited on Christmas Day, 1994, by a reporter from the London Sunday Times, named Nick Rufford. He reported that ``Evidence of the use of forced labor was abundant. Inmates marched in double file. Trucks with `Beishu prison' stenciled on the sides in Chinese characters were parked inside the factory gates. Behind the plant stood a walled compound with watchtowers and guards.'' Mr. Rufford reported 3,500 tons of graphite from the mine was shipped to Britain last year.As many of my colleagues know, Amnesty International and other sources have provided ample documentation of the cruel and abusive practices common in Chinese prisons. That abuse, the restricted journals clearly show, is translated directly into hard currency earned in the export trade.For example, in a journal whose readership is restricted to prison officials, a writer laid out the brutal logic of using prison labor for export production: ``Prisoners have become commodity producers. they are cheap and concentrated. They produce labor intensive products.'' It is precisely the goods which fall into the labor intensive category that form the bulk of Chinese exports to the United States.The article also shows that it is common practice in China to forcibly retain so-called labor reform prisoners for indefinite periods beyond the expiration of their terms. the industrial advantages are explained clearly to prison administrators: ``Prisoners retained for in-camp employment * * * can not join labor unions, do not enjoy retirement benefits when they become old, and their wages and living standards are low.''These abuses seal the case against granting China MFN status. China does not play by the rules. China does not reciprocate the trade benefits we grant to them. Despite the fact that over one-third of China's exports are sold into the United States market, China's high tariffs and non tariff barriers limit access to the Chinese market for United States goods and services. Only 2 percent of United States exports are allowed into China. The result is a $34 billion United States trade deficit with China in 1995. This doesn't include any of the stolen intellectual property of the illegally smuggled guns. I strongly urge my colleagues that we no longer reward China's constant violations of agreements. Vote against granting MFN status to China.",
