    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the experiences of Pamela Ferguson-Brey. She is the Honolulu League of Women Voters Human Resource chair and she atteded the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China.In September, 1995, I joined women from around the world at the United Nations Fourth World Conference in China. The Non- Governmental Organization (NGO) conference provided a platform for community organizations from around the world to influence their governments to move more quickly toward equal rights and human rights for women and girls. The NGO forum also provided women from around the world with a forum to highlight issues from their neighborhood, town, city, region, and country and brought participants together to discuss local, national, international solutions to these issues. The NGO conference was an overwhelming experience. From the moment that I first boarded the plane to China and during the conference there was an unspoken acknowledgment, a bond and an excitement between the conference participants. Tens of thousands of women from around the world together for one purpose--to accelerate the movement of governments toward equal human rights for women and girls. While we were strangers and did not all speak the same language or have the same customs, we all shared a unique understanding about our status as women. As women, we know what it means to be denied human rights because of our gender status. As women, we know what is means to be afraid of violence because we are not safe in our streets or in our homes. We know what is means to be denied equal access to reproductive and medical care. We know what is means to be denied a seat at the table when policy decisions are being made about our lives and rights. And we know that in over a dozen counties, through infanticide and dowry deaths, women and girls are killed because of their gender. The bond between women at the conference was also a reflection of the commitment that these thousands of women had to make to realize the changes that are necessary at the local, national and international level to assure that women have equal human rights. At the opening ceremony to the NGO conference NGO participants sang ``I'm going to fight for women's freedom, never turning back, never turning back.'' I think of these words and the conference and I am recommitted and energized to help my own community move forward more quickly toward equal human rights for women and girls.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak against H.R. 3136. My opposition stems not from a desire to prevent the needed increase in the debt limit, nor do I oppose the increase in the Social Security earnings limit contained in section 4, a proposition I supported with my vote in favor of H.R. 2684 last December.Rather, my objection, Mr. Speaker, is to the measure before us, which rests on my adamant opposition to the line-item veto provisions of section 3. The line-item veto is not about money as such. It is about power, specifically the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of the Federal Government. This has nothing to do with Republicans and Democrats. It has nothing to do with the contract except the contract we should be keeping with history that provided for our constitutional democracy to be able to sustain a balance between the executive and the legislative. It assumes that the executive branch, compared to the legislature, is inherently inclined to restrain spending. In fact, however, congressional appropriations have been lower than the amounts requested by the past three Presidents, Democrat and Republican alike. In denying Congress the authority to single out proposed rescissions for individual consideration, H.R. 3136 denies to the Congress an authority it grants to the President.If the President can unilaterally veto individual items in a single bill, why is Congress required to sustain or override those vetoes as an indivisible package? Why is Congress denied the authority, why are we denying ourselves the authority to judge each veto cast by the President? The upshot is more power for the executive branch, less for the legislature. By giving the President power to veto specific tax and appropriation items within a single bill, H.R. 3136 deprives the legislative branch of its share of its ability to strike a compromise with the executive.Mr. Speaker, it upsets the carefully calibrated balance between the legislative and executive branches of Government. That balance is what inclines our political system to compromise. Look at what is happening in the rest of the world where the executive has exclusive authority. I know I am going to be among the few votes that is going to be cast today. What I regret is, and this has happened before in our legislative history, there will be a few who will try to strike a balance to keep the power of the legislature against the executive, and one day there will be a Ph.D. writing a thesis about it, how we gave up our power, how we gave up the balance of power that exists in our democracy. Vote ``no'' on 3136.",

They do not know the difference between Hawaii and Florida.So when they ask me about taxing and spending, I say, ``I don't know, ask the Republican National Committee. They're the ones that put out Representative Karen Thurman's work sheet for my work sheet.''They say they want to represent the values of the people of the First District of Hawaii. Well, I am in good shape to do that. I do not live in Florida.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I ask that this bill be defeated, and I am sorry to say that I have to disagree with my friend from Illinois, Mr. Hyde, on this. I speak to him personally now and request this, a reconsideration with respect to habeas corpus.This past weekend I saw a student production, in an attic in a home in Honolulu, of ``Death and the Maiden,'' Ariel Dorfman's play about Chile. The principal theme was when habeas corpus is absent, there we have authoritarianism and dictatorship. It leads to torture.In Dorfman's essay on political code and literary code, and I am quoting from it:Terror then has a public character. As such it leads to a great ideological operation which authorizes, in the name of Western Christian values, a purifying crusade against the forces of the devil and of the anti-Nation.He goes on to say:The principal obsession of authoritarian politics is to suppress history and those who could modify it, postulating an unchangeable and superior reality, God, father, and family, to which one owes loyalty.This is the difficulty. If we abandon habeas corpus, we abandon one of the foundation stones of the United States of America.You have heard me on this floor expound before on the right to a trial, the right to be able to vote freely, the right to sue, and the fourth leg of that foundation is habeas corpus, the right to be brought before a Federal court to say that your rights have been violated. If we take that away, then we are succumbing to terrorism. We are terrorizing the Constitution.The time lapses. But the Constitution goes on. I ask, please, Mr. Hyde, reconsideration on the habeas corpus part of this bill, and then perhaps we could vote on the terrorist bill with full meaning.",

    "title": "GROUNDS FOR OPPOSITION TO THE ANTITERRORISM BILL",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I want to elaborate, if I might, on the remarks that I made with respect to the so-called antiterrorism bill earlier. As members know, we are constrained by time in our remarks, and by having 5 minutes today, perhaps I can make a little more clear or elaborate a bit on what the grounds were for my opposition.Mr. Speaker, let me quote in part from a story written in today's Washington Post, as follows, excerpting from the story:It marks the first time in more than a century of law on the writ of habeas corpus that Federal judges would have to defer to State court determinations on whether a prisoner's constitutional rights were violated. A writ of habeas corpus is a way for Federal judges to assess whether a defendant's conviction is unconstitutional because, for example, his right to a fair trial was infringed. The writ orders the State to produce the prisoner, the body, or the corpus, so that he can make his case to a Federal court.Mr. Speaker, I had indicated in my previous remarks that this past weekend my wife and I attended a play, were observers at a play that was given in Honolulu in a very small venue. I do not think there were 20 people there, mostly students. It was a student production, student-directed. The set was very simple. There are only three characters, if you will. The play was called ``Death and the Maiden.'' It comes from a work by Schubert and is a beautiful piece, orchestral piece. Death and the Maiden was played by a doctor who is a participant in torture in an unnamed Latin American country. He plays the symphonic piece as he tortures people, to torment them.In the play, a lawyer who has been named to a commission to examine what has happened in the country previously with respect to those who have been arrested and tortured and killed, disappeared, indicates that the reason that the regime was able to accomplish this in the first place was the abandonment of habeas corpus; that is to say, the capacity of the individual to be able to take a case to a Federal judge, in the context of the United States, to ask that judge to determine whether or not he or she is being fairly held.As my good friend from California, Mr. Miller, said to me just very recently in discussion about these remarks and positions on the bill, the loss of our rights and our privileges do not come in grand sweeps. They come by degree, they come by circumstances that are deemed at the moment more than sufficient to erode that particular right.And so I asked friends at the Library of Congress to provide for me a copy of the playwright's essays. Ariel Dorfman, the Chilean writer, is the author of the play ``Death and the Maiden,'' and he was written a book of essays or compiled a book of his essays called ``Some Write to the Future.'' I recommend it to the Speaker and to others who are concerned about this. I realize it was an agonizing vote for many.But in the process of commenting on Chile, the country from which Mr. Dorfman comes, he wrote an essay once called the Political Code and the Literary Code, the testimonial genre in Chile today.In it he says, in that essay:Terror, then, has a public character. As such, it leads to a great ideological operation, which authorizes, in the name of Western, Christian values, a purifying crusade against the forces of the Devil and of the antination. The principal obsession of authoritarian politics is to suppress history and those who could modify it, postulating an unchangeable and superior reality, God, fatherland, family, to which one owes loyalty. What is paradoxical about this ideological framework is that it excuses a repression that, in fact, is never admitted by official channels. Memory of the suffering must survive in gossip, in rumor, in the whispering of what they did, and even in official threats, but at the same time, in each concrete case, in each undeniable and undocumented case, with damaged teeth, genitals, and ribs, in spite of each relative's identification, in spite of the cries of pain, the truth of the violence is denied. The people are punished, but in the long run the relationship is made benevolently and paternally innocent, translating it into terms that are almost familial and intimate: expulsion and exclusion of the wayward, the recalcitrant, the disturbers of public order; reintegration, of the misguided and the repentant. Neo- colonial fascism takes the bourgeois dream to its totalitarian culmination.Mr. Speaker, in that context we see, then, that to eliminate habeas corpus does damage to the Constitution beyond repair.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, if the gentlewoman will yield, it might be of interest in the context that you have just established in regard to the minimum wage to note that the State of Hawaii already has a minimum wage at $5.25. We were an economy in Hawaii based on agriculture. We have moved into one of the most service-oriented economies it is possible to have; that is to say, a dependence on travel and tourism.Yet the argument is always made that if you are in a service economy, you have to keep wages at an absolute minimum. If you are in an agriculture economy, you have to keep wages at an absolute minimum. Yet the prosperity of the State of Hawaii has been based upon the fact that we recognized that people who are working, families that have to work, are best able not just to survive, but to prosper, when they are able to earn more than just a living wage, more than just an adequate wage, but a wage which enables them to fully participate in the economy.That economy is invested in by the very people who are doing the work. The money stays in the area where it is earned. It is not taken by multinational companies, by international companies, elsewhere. It is not moved into a global economy as such.That money earned in that State, whether it is Connecticut, whether it is in Hawaii, whether it is anyplace, whether it is in Georgia, in Cobb County, in Mr. Gingrich's home district, that money stays in that district. That money is invested in that district. Small business people make money in that district as a result of it.Those kinds of wages, the minimum wage, in service oriented jobs, when it is earned, is spent in the clothing store to buy shoes for the children right there in the local community. That is where it goes. The small investor, the small businesses, are the direct beneficiary of the raise in the minimum wage.",

    "title": "WAIHEE MARSH INCLUSION IN OAHU NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE COMPLEX",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for H.R. 1772, to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire certain interests in the Waihe'e Marsh for inclusion in the Oahu National Wildlife Refuge, introduced by my colleague from Hawaii, Representative Patsy Mink.The Waihe'e Marsh, also called the Kahalu'u wetland, is located on the windward side of Oahu. Acquisition of Waihe'e Marsh is vital to the integrity of the Oahu National Wildlife Refuge [Refuge]. The purpose of the refuge is to protect and manage a network of wetlands throughout Oahu for the recovery of endangered waterbirds, migratory birds, and other values of natural wetlands. Specifically, Waihe'e Marsh is identified as a priority wetland site in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's regional wetlands concept plan: Emergency Wetlands Resource Act [USFWS 1990]. Throughout Hawaii there has been a substantial cumulative loss of wetlands.I would like to point out to my colleagues in the House that the natural environment of Hawaii is one of our planet's most significant treasures. The islands are home to more unique species than any place of similar size on the Earth. Yet, Hawaii has the most alarming concentration of species teetering on the brink of extinction. While Hawaii makes up only 0.2 percent of the land area we account for nearly 75 percent of the Nation's historically documented plant and bird extinctions of the United States. Currently, more than one-fourth of the 959 animals and plants on the U.S. endangered and threatened species list come from Hawaii.Under H.R. 1772 Waihe'e Marsh would be rehabilitated and managed for the recovery and support of endangered Hawaiian waterbirds, such as the endangered Hawaiian Stilt, Hawaiian coot, Hawaiian moorhen and Hawaiian duck, which are all protected under the Endangered Species Act. Also, wetlands in Hawaii provide habitat for several species of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl which are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.I want to mention to my colleagues that the importance of Waihe'e Marsh is not limited to plants and animals. This has been an issue that has been worked from the grassroots. I commend all the hard work put in by the local communities. The Waihe'e Marsh is important for the surrounding communities because it naturally serves as a flood control holding area and the vegetation contributes to the control of shoreline erosion for nearby residential areas. Also, the marsh serves as a filter to protect water quality and coral reef communities in Kaneohe Bay.Mr. Speaker, this is a worthwhile piece of legislation that deserves the full support of all my colleagues.",

    "title": "HELIUM PRIVATIZATION ACT OF 1996",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise with regrets, acknowledging H.R. 3008, a bill to close the Federal helium program, will pass today. In these days of downsizing, it seems the time has come to terminate programs which appear to have outlived their usefulness like the Federal helium program.I want to note that I say appear, Mr. Speaker. Since 1925, when the Defense Department believed that dirigibles or blimps would be an integral part of our national defense, the Federal Government has managed a helium program. Today the Federal helium program continues to serve the needs of major Federal users of helium such as NASA and DOE laboratories, who are required to purchase helium from the Bureau of Mines.The Federal Government got involved in helium production at a time when there was no private helium production. Today, however, the private sector manufactures 90 percent of the world's helium. For this reason groups such as the National Taxpayers Union, the ``20/20'' TV program, the Interior Department inspector general, and the Heritage Foundation, an unlikely conglomeration, have called for its elimination.H.R. 3008, like its predecessor, H.R. 3967 in the 103d Congress, enjoys bipartisan support. While I did not support termination of the program, I recognize after several years of consideration Congress is poised to resolve the question of the helium program by terminating it. But I remain concerned that we have not done enough to aid the 200-plus employees in Amarillo, TX, who will lose their livelihood as consequence of our decision.The bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to sell off all the equipment, real property, refining facilities, and gradually sell off most of the crude helium currently stored in Amarillo, TX. Funds from the sale will be deposited in a helium fund established under the 1960 act, and will be available for various termination activities, including some employee benefits already authorized under law. Eventually the fund will be applied against the debt to reduce the deficit. This is, in any event, the hope.During the committee consideration of this bill, I offered an amendment to provide employee benefits in addition to those authorized under existing law so that the 200-plus employees in Amarillo, many of whom have built their careers on this program, would get the same kind of additional education and job placement assistance that we gave defense employees working at bases that were closed. These are people, Mr. Speaker, men and women, who through no fault of their own find themselves working for a Federal program targeted for downsizing and in fact elimination.My amendment would have given these people help in addition to what the Secretary has already authorized to provide, the same kind of help that we have provided, as I indicated, to many of the defense employees working at military bases scheduled for closure: job placement assistance, extended life and health insurance coverage, and the option to take an early retirement without penalty.Sadly, my Republican colleagues on the committee could not be persuaded to provide this type of much-needed aid. During committee debate, my friend and colleague from California [Mr. Calvert] argued that the Secretary already has the authority to provide these benefits. This is simply incorrect, Mr. Speaker.My amendment would have added authority necessary to enable the Secretary to extend health and life insurance coverage for 3 years beyond an employee's termination. The Secretary does not have the ability to provide this assistance under current law. My amendment would have allowed Federal helium employees access to the enhanced early retirement option, and current law does not provide for this protection. My amendment would have given Federal helium employees hiring preference Government-wide, not just in the Amarillo area as is provided under existing law.So, Mr. Speaker, my amendment failed. Even though I agreed with my good friend and colleague from Texas [Mr. Thornberry] that we did not need to terminate this program, I, and I believe he, could see that this bill would pass. So I tried to lessen the blow so that the helium workers might be able to find another Federal job, or if they served 20 years, they could take an early out and retire from civil service.As of now, this is not to be, Mr. Speaker. These activities would have been paid from the existing helium account and would have cost relatively pennies, especially in comparison to the costs of unemployment benefits. The Congressional Budget Office said that my amendment would have had no budgetary effect.It seemed only fair to offer this assistance to the innocent victims of our downsizing zeal, so that the employees who had nothing to do with the difficulties facing the program would not be left stranded by their Government. But my Republican colleagues could not see their way clear to help their fellow public servants in this instance, and so today I expect we will pass H.R. 3008 under suspension of the rules so we can praise ourselves for making Government smaller.We could have done so, Mr. Speaker, in a much more humane and compassionate manner. I will ask the other body to consider my amendment before we conclude the legislative process. Loyal workers in the helium program deserve no less.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

In this particular instance, we are talking about quality of life, and I would like to follow then on the remarks of the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Hefner] as well.Unfortunately, the Department of Defense has come to rely upon us in Congress when it comes to budgetary matters with respect to quality of life. What happens is, on the procurement side, in the more exotic weapons systems, particularly those that cost a great deal of money, they push that part of the envelope right up to the edge, and then they count on Members of Congress to come through on questions of quality of life, whether it is barracks or family housing or what have you, child development centers, et cetera. And we have done that.I want to commend the gentleman from Colorado [Mr. Hefley] for his bipartisan approach on it, the chair of the subcommittee; and my good friend from North Carolina [Mr. Hefner] for seeing to it that these quality of life issues have not been abandoned.In particular, I can say in the area of the Pacific, we have dealt with Schofield Barracks and the renewal of barracks there, and we are very appreciative, and this year at Kaneohe for the Marine Barracks. General Krulak, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, called very, very happy to see that we were going to start the phasing in of the new barracks proposals at Kaneohe in the State of Hawaii.I will say that this has a further good effect. What this does is stop the competition for nonexistent rental housing between military families and civilian families. The result, the 6 years that I have been in office and the plan that I started out with and presented on a bipartisan basis, was that this would reduce rents, reduce the cost of living in Hawaii for civilian families and improve the quality of life for military families, I think a good result from that, and I am very grateful for it.I have two other points that I would like to make very briefly. One, as a way of improving this, I hope and I think the gentleman from Colorado [Mr. Hefley] has indicated that he has an interest in this, and other Republican members on our authorizing committee have indicated an interest in this, is that we start thinking about capital budgeting and start differentiating operating costs from capital costs, particularly using as a demonstration model perhaps quality of life issues in the military. We have started that.The gentleman from Colorado [Mr. Hefley] was instrumental in helping us put together legislation for public-private partnerships to see to it that we can get into capital expenditures. If we can differentiate capital expenditures from operating expenditures, I think we can make vast improvements in the quality of life area and demonstrate a way of moving toward more sensible spending patterns that will result not only in helping to balance the budget but in moving forward in a sensible way with our military budgeting.So I am appreciative to the gentleman from Colorado [Mr. Hefley], the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Hefner], to the gentlewoman from Nevada [Mrs. Vucanovich], and others who have helped support this issue.Finally, Mr. Chairman, let me say that when I was first elected in a special election in 1986, there was someone here who took me under his wing, that acted as a mentor to me, someone whom I believe to be an example of the true gentleman that exists in the House of Representatives, someone who will be more than missed, someone for whom I have the greatest possible respect, someone that we know and military families throughout the country will appreciate for decades to come because of his work at Fort DeRussy and Hale Koa to see that the recreation needs of our military are taken care of. All of us are going to miss with all of our hearts Representative Sonny Montgomery from Mississippi.",

I indicated in that discussion that I had in conjunction with the Congressional Record in 1996 that there was no such thing as a balanced budget being prepared, let alone put forward in 1996, and we have the same situation today.Mr. Speaker, I do not doubt that it is very important for Mr. Dole to resign from the Senate to run as citizen and/or candidate Dole, because I do not think that in his role as Senator, let alone majority leader, that he would have the opportunity to have much credibility in the way of putting forward a balanced budget amendment, let alone putting forward a balanced budget for 1997.My fundamental point, Mr. Speaker, is that the budget that will be presented to us shortly, possibly this week, and be dispatched as quickly as possible, as opposed to 1996, dispatched as quickly as possible because it is not a balanced budget.Now, my good friend, my good and dear friend I would say, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Kasich], will come down, and he is an engaging individual. When I state my affection and friendship for him, Mr. Speaker, you know that it is a feeling that is genuine on my part. I value his friendship and I have genuine affection for him as an individual, but he has an impossible task. I grant he is probably the best one to try to put it forward.As you know, Mr. Speaker, he is an avuncular person, even as yourself, and he will come down on the floor, and with his engaging smile and his wit and rhetoric, we will put the best possible face on the fact that this is not a balanced budget document. It is not balanced for 1997, it most certainly is not going to be balanced for the year 2002.The reason I am taking the special order time, Mr. Speaker, with the budget, is that given the rules of the House it is virtually impossible to have any kind of lengthy discussion that would illuminate for the public and for the Members exactly what the budget is all about. Most of this takes place in a hearing room, in the Committee on the Budget hearings, and in staff work that is being done, discussions between the House and the other body with respect to a conference on the budget. Suffice to say, and I will for the Record, and would be happy to engage, as I did previously when we discussed the 1996 budget, be happy to engage anyone from the Republican side or from the Democratic side, because the budget being prepared from the Democratic side does not balance either. The difference is that we can count, I can count.As you know, Mr. Speaker, I would like to see the budget deficit disappear, but I think we should take a much longer period of time to do it so that we do not endanger the economy. I think that, interestingly enough, considering the labels that are put out about liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans or conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans, whatever these labels are, that I think the Federal Reserve, Mr. Greenspan's approach has been that the economy should be prevented from slipping into either recession or depression or slipping into a phase of inflation or hyperinflation. I think the stock market reflects this.The fact is that the growth in the economy is such that with a judicious approach to deficit cutting, we could keep the economy robust and reduce the deficit. This is, in fact, what President Clinton has accomplished. I know this is a source of great distress to those who predicted disaster with the Clinton budget, as presented in 1992 and 1993, but the fact is that the deficit has been cut considerably both in percentage terms and in real dollars for 3 years running now, something which has not happened since the end of World War II.So the President, not having the benefit of a Congress which is supportive of him in the majority; that is to say, a Republican Congress before him, has accepted the admonition of the majority to utilize the Congressional Budget Office figures in order to present to the public the idea of what would constitute numbers sufficient to have a balanced budget.In that role; that is to say, of a President who is faced with a Congress that wants to balance the budget utilizing the Congressional Budget Office figures, he accepted that ultimately in 1996. His priorities were different. As a result of the priorities within those priorities were, the President vetoed various elements of the budget and the budget was ultimately settled in a series of confrontations, a series of recriminations and arguments back and forth as to who was doing what and why.In the course of events, the Government was closed on various occasions and generally it was seen as a kind of sorry affair all the way around. Nonetheless, my point here is recounting that today is that we will not see that again, apparently, in 1997. We will go through the same series of illusions, using somewhat different numbers, but we will come to a much more rapid conclusion. The reason we will come to the more rapid conclusion is that we will not have the opportunity this year to go through--if the gentleman from Michigan would step to the microphone, I will be happy to yield at an appropriate point.Mr. Speaker, if Mr. Smith will grant me just a moment or two more to make the fundamental of my case, then I will be happy to yield to him. Always a pleasure to see him. In fact, he was one of the few people, as I mentioned previously, Mr. Speaker, who was willing to engage in a dialog and a colloquy on the question of the budget, and I value his input and exchange.As I indicated, Mr. Speaker, in 1996, if you will recall, we went through weeks actually, not just hours or days of discussion but weeks of discussion, and in the course of that discussion I was on the floor reviewing the budget, and I will do so again for 1997. My fundamental premise is this, that just as there was only the illusion of a balanced budget proposal, whether single year or multiyear, in 1996, there will be only the illusion presented this year. It will be strictly for political consumption and will not amount to anything worth the paper that it is written on in such elaborate fashion.I have here, Mr. Speaker, in my hand, and I will not have extensive charts down on the floor, I think the report speaks for itself, it is the concurrent resolution on the budget, fiscal year 1997, a report of the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives to accompany the Congressional Resolution 178 setting forth the congressional budget of the United States Government for the fiscal years 1997 through 2002, and it has additional minority and dissenting views.Now, this document runs some 450-plus pagers, 455 pages or so, and it is a very interesting document. It takes 44 pages, which is the first 44, takes 44 pages to get to the actual budget, when we actually get to the fiscal year budget for 1997. It is preceded on the page 43 with the end of politics as usual. This, I take it, is not exactly an attempt at humor on the part of the Committee on the Budget, the Committee on the Budget not being known for its sense of humor, other than in the person of, as I said, the aforementioned chair of the Committee on the Budget, but in the end of politics as usual, functions by function description, it says, ``The discussions that follow describe the budget resolution's recommended priorities for the fiscal years 1997 through 2002.''Now, it took us 44 pages to get there. We went through everything, including attacking corporate subsidies, economic assumptions of the budget resolution, the Clinton crunch, Americans' anxiety about their economic future, quite a rhetorical set-to in the first 44 pages. But what do we have then on page 44?Well, it says at the end of each function, ``Additional provisions with budgetary effects are mentioned.'' Mentioned, Mr. Speaker. I am going to get into a little more detail. The discussions that follow reflect the assumptions underlying the House Committee on the Budget's recommendations concerning the funding priorities for programs in each function.The actual changes for the programs fall under the authority of the authorizing and appropriating committees with jurisdiction over the programs.Let me explain very briefly, for those Members who may not be fully familiar with the budget process and those members of the public which may follow the Congressional Record on this who may not be totally familiar with it, once the Committee on the Budget makes its recommendations, it provides through that recommendation a kind of game plan for us in the House and the other body, a game plan for the Congress.Then the various committees in the Congress, whether they are authorizing committees or whether they are appropriating committees, authorizing meaning the program committees, the subject matter committees, and the Committee on Appropriations and its subcommittees, those who provide the money for the functions that are approved and authorized, they put the actual numbers and programs behind the Committee on the Budget recommendations.So with that in mind, what do we get to? We hear from Mr. Dole, Mr. Clinton, Mr. Kasich, Mr. Sabo, heartfelt and I will say totally sincere admonitions to us to arrive at a balanced budget. Well, as I indicated, I think that can be done. I think it will take a lot longer period than 1997 to 2002, and I need only look at the actual budget document itself to come up with proof of that.Let us examine what it actually says on page 44 of the budget resolution. Fiscal year 1997 through 2002, the deficit starting in 1997 will be--and these are estimates, they could go up or down. We realize that, but this is the best guess. And it is an informed guess by the Committee on the Budget and utilizing the congressional budget figures, and I take them at their word on this. And for conversation's sake, I will agree that these are the numbers that are under discussion and upon which we will vote--$163 billion deficit in 1995; 1996, it was $150 billion. The 1995 figure was down from the figures previous to that. You may recall during the last years of Mr. Bush's administration, the figures were 250 and above, between 250 and 300 billion. The number 163 then was progress. It may be too high for some people but unless you want to literally amputate the economy in order to achieve a balanced budget, this is certainly within the range of acceptability. It certainly has been reflected, that acceptability has been reflected in the conservative bodies, if you will, of financial opinion in this country as manifested in the policies of the Federal Reserve and the response of the stock exchange. So we had 163 billion, down considerably from the 250 to 290 billion plus of previous years; 1996, 150; 1997, the estimate is 147.This is a deficit I am citing. It is not something I am making up. I am taking this directly from page 44 under the column line deficit/surplus. Either it is a deficit or a surplus. This is the deficit. We get deficits in 1998, 1999, the year 2000, 2001, going from 147 to 142 to 114 to 87 to 39, certainly progress, then suddenly, as if by magic, Mr. Speaker, in the year 2002, we get a plus 3 billion, $3.185 billion.To me it is like watching a television show I saw recently, I think it was called the Wonderful World of Magic. This is the wonderful world of congressional budgeting. When someone is sawed in half, I saw this again, that is one of the oldest tricks, sawing a, generally a young woman in half, we do not really saw her in half. You have the illusion of her being sawed in half. She waves from one end, and the box is split in half and the feet are wiggling at the other end. Then the box is brought back together again and magically she reappears. That knife that went through that body apparently was an illusion.Well, the deficit cutting knife that is going through the deficit here between the years 1997 and 2002 is an illusion. Because suddenly, she is whole, the budget is whole, the budget has been balanced in 2002. Yet what happens then between 1997 and the year 2002, we have had an accumulated deficit of 528 billion. But magically, after that 528 billion in increasing deficit has occurred, suddenly, 528 billion later we achieve a $3 billion surplus for that 1 year. After that the deficit explodes again.Mr. Speaker, surely you can see and surely Members can see and surely the public, upon reading this document, will see that this is a game that is being played, a ballet with the books, a budget that is in name, a budget balancing act which is in name only, an act, yes, but certainly not balanced.I see the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Smith] has taken the rostrum down on the floor and I presume would like to have some discussion. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.",

    "text": "You and I may not be here after today. Although I must say that this does show, I think, that this is not so much a question of majority versus minority. It is a question of whether you want to be honest about it.My defense, if you will, of the President's approach under this is that the President has accepted, and I will say in good faith, the congressional budget numbers as offered by the majority. His difference comes in this, in how he prioritizes the spending changes. We can argue that and I think we should argue it a lot more.My fear is, and what I said earlier today was, because it is so difficult to understand terms like out years and whether a surplus is really a surplus and those kinds of things, because it is so difficult, the majority, I am given to understand, intends to put forward the budget and the amount of discussion that is going to take place about the budget, such as you and I are having right now, will be minimized. In fact, it will be virtually nonexistent. From what I can gather, both sides are apparently quite content to do that. Although I would welcome the opportunity, if Mr. Solomon and the Committee on Rules would agree, to open up the budget for 3 or 4 or 5 days' review.",

    "text": "I not only agree, but I think we should have an extensive discussion as to what exactly constitutes welfare, what exactly constitutes discretionary spending, what programs should we have and not have.For example, my understanding is that the Speaker, for some reason unknown to me, is proposing a defense act or bill which revolves around national missile defense. Now, I would say, and I would hope you would agree, that the majority has not only very able, but extremely well-informed, experienced legislators on the Committee on National Security, of whom I can name two or three right now: Mr. Weldon, Mr. Hunter, and Mr. Cunningham. I can th1nk of just three offhand. And the minority has people like Mr. Spratt.Mr. Dellums, others I could name, Mr. Peterson of Florida, who are equally capable, and equally capable, by the way, of defending and rebutting on the question of national missile defense.But the Speaker has said he wants to bring forward a missile bill. Now, I do not think the Speaker knows any more about missiles than he knows about Hawaiian malasadas, and I do not think he knows much about malasadas, and I will spell that after this is over, but take it from me, it is a Portuguese donut, and I do not think he knows much about it. I think Leonard's knows all about it out in Honolulu.But that budget, if we are going to talk about spending and welfare, has to be looked at very hard. The Congressional Budget Office, as I understand it, came up with figures just to acquire this defense system, missile system, national missile defense, of between $30 and $60 billion. Now, that is a serious question; and we cannot hide behind the idea that somehow, if you are for it, you are for defense, if you are against it, you are against defense, when you have to put it in terms of what constitutes proper spending under the admonitions that you just enunciated.",

That deserves a discussion.I am not saying necessarily a lengthy discussion, but it certainly deserves a discussion in depth, and perhaps the gentleman could indicate whether my understanding is correct, that the intention of the majority, the intention of the majority leader and the Committee on Rules is to dispatch this budget within a day or so of our discussion today.",

    "text": "Thank you very much. I appreciate it.As usual, Mr. Smith has been very forthright in his presentation, and I am appreciative of that. However, I would hope, Mr. Speaker, that you would consider what has been said during this colloquy, which I hope was at least informative, if not illuminating, and in the process then think about what Mr. Smith said.We know what he would prefer. He would prefer the deficit to disappear more quickly, and the reason that I find the notion amusing is I would prefer to be able to dunk a basketball, but I probably would have to pay a lot more in taxes. But I do not think that is going to happen. I mean it is an interesting thing to think about. In fact, I thought about it a lot in my life. I look at that basket up there, and I think, you know, it would be interesting to be able to dunk the ball. But it is a fantasy, and the difference between, I think, a sane person and someone who is steeped in illusion is to know the difference between fantasy and reality.It is a fantasy, and by Mr. Smith's own calculations it is a fantasy, to believe that we are really going to balance the budget in 5 years' time, or 7 years' time, because we have not taken into account where we borrowed the money to be able to put the numbers on the page to pretend that we were balancing the budget. Or we have imagined savings that somehow are going to take place like a balloon payment.You notice I mentioned the phrase balloon payment because I think that is as close as the average person would come to be able to relate their own budget, say their own mortgage, to what is taking place here in the Congress.I take no pleasure in going through this. On the contrary. I am glad Mr. Smith was down here so that it does not look at if it is just something I am conjuring up in order to take up time or to try and make some remarks that can be seen as very smart and sophisticated and dismissive of the genuine problem that exists with respect to the deficit. On the contrary. I would take what Mr. Smith said very much to heart.If you recall, if I recall correctly, he stated something: We should do it more gradually. Well, say 7 years was gradually to him. Well, maybe it would take 17. After all, we take 30 years to pay a mortgage on a home. In many instances we take 5 or 6 years to pay a car, we take some months or even years to pay off an appliance. It seems to me that if we are talking about the economic stability of the United States of America, to put a 30-year timetable or a 15-year timetable on paying down our deficit so that our economy stays stable, in fact stays robust and growing, that inflation stays in check, and interest rates remain low, and confidence high, that that would be an excellent use of our time vis-a-vis the growth capacity and possibilities of the U.S. economy.So there is no need to go through this kind of a charade with the budget unless we are trying to score political points and not deal realistically with the question of the budget and balancing it.Let me further state then at this point a subject that we got into very briefly; that is to say Mr. Smith and I got into it very briefly: How do you balance the budget when you are borrowing against Social Security, the so-called surplus in Social Security? And parenthetically, Mr. Speaker, let me say that that is not really a surplus. What we are doing now is what the average person thinks about when they put their savings together. They save now in order to be able to draw upon it in the future when it is needed.Now, the rough parallel to that is the Social Security System. We are paying into Social Security more than we take out presently because we know that in the future those funds will be called upon to be paid out. More people will be drawing upon Social Security with less people paying into it, we will have to make adjustments at some point in order to take that into account. Now, presumably the economy will grow, the percentage that may be taken in your Social Security tax, your payroll tax, et cetera, may increase in absolute numbers because the economy grows.All of those things can be guessed at, taken into account, but nonetheless the general proposition is, is that the Social Security trust fund must take in more money than it pays out as it goes along in order to be able to meet the requirements that Social Security will have to meet sometime in the next century in the early part of the century.If that is the case, and we are borrowing from Social Security trust fund and other trust funds, principally Social Security, if we are borrowing from them and have no plan to pay it back, because I think Mr. Smith agreed that nowhere in the 1997 budget projections through the next 5 years is there a plan to pay back Social Security, now, Mr. Speaker, if you and I borrowed money from ourselves and had no plan to pay it back, I do not think either of us would feel that that money somehow would magically appear in the year 2002.All that being said, Mr. Speaker, the borrowing, the deficit rising, no plan to pay it back to the Social Security System, how then is it possible to claim that the budget will be balanced in 2002? How is that possible and at the same time have a tax cut that will take revenues out of the system?Does it not make sense to you, Mr. Speaker, that if you are borrowing money in order in order to mask a deficit, that if you have a tax cut, which in fact increases the amount of money that will not be going to the Treasury, in addition to what you are borrowing, you are actually increasing the deficit? you are actually increasing the deficit even more.This is why I oppose this idea of cutting taxes while you say you are balancing the budget. I have no objection to a tax cut if the tax cut is not couched in terms of balancing the budget. Surely we have been through this before.Mr. Speaker, I have no objection to tax cuts as such. Quite the opposite. I would like to see tax incentives. I would like to see, for example, and I think it is well known, I believe that we should have a business meal entertainment deduction increase. I would like to see it at 100 percent. I have no objection to supply-side economics, as such, when we can justify it, deliberate it, and discuss it on an issue-by-issue basis. I think that I could make a case that the business meal entertainment deduction is a job provider, is a job generator; that we could find labor and management on the same side of the table on that. I think the spousal deduction for travel ought to be put forward as an incentive to boosting the economy.I think we will find, Mr. Speaker, in our home States that tourism, entertainment, and travel constitute one of the top three business endeavors in our States. Tourism, travel, and entertainment is the top money producer and job generator in some 13 States, and it is one of the top three in 30-plus States.I am willing, Mr. Speaker, not only willing but eager, to have a discussion about where we can have tax incentives and tax breaks, and discuss what constitutes, as I said with the gentleman from Michigan previously, what constitutes welfare. Welfare is not just something that comes with a single mother and children. Welfare can come to corporations, too.I notice that Mr. Trump was not hurting for people to come to his aid and rescue when he needed all the benefits of corporate welfare, when he was running through his various real estate machinations in New York and Atlantic City and elsewhere. Business has these incentives and breaks all the time.I think individuals ought to be able to finance their education. We cannot exist in the 21st century without a good education, and I think that would be a good investment, if we can find a way to provide tax incentives and breaks to accomplish that. I think we would benefit from that.The argument against that is the immediate consequences of some incentives and cuts and breaks, whatever we want to call them, may be a drop in the Treasury. I would argue that. We would have to determine whether or not, for example, with business meal entertainment deductions and the spousal travel deduction, if we were able to increase that, I think more business would be done, and I could make an argument that revenues would increase. This is essentially the supply-side argument that took place in the 1980's.However, if we take it in such a broad brush that it is to cover everything, then I think we run into the trouble that this budget runs into, that we cannot make the numbers add up. That is where I think the difficulty occurs here. I would like to think, and I certainly hope that I am a reasonable person who takes his oath as seriously as anyone does in all of the Congress, and I believe every one of my colleagues and yourself, Mr. Speaker, takes himself or herself quite seriously when it comes to carrying out their duty under their oath of office.As a result of that, I would like to think that while we may have disagreements as to the precise way in which we can accomplish our goals, that nonetheless, the discussion as to how to arrive at that is not only very valuable, but crucial to determining whether or not we are actually going to accomplish the goal. The goal here is ultimately to balance the budget while keeping the economy robust, and to see to it that the average American throughout the spectrum of opportunity and individual capacities and abilities does the very best that they can nationwide. That is what we do.Mr. Speaker, it used to be a point of pride in this country that people earned a good living, that they could end up better than where they started. Now we seem to see an ethos developing of cost-cutting, which means people-cutting. People are being rewarded at the top of the corporate hierarchy for being able to cut jobs out, and to see to it that people are maligned simply for trying to get an increase in the minimum wage.I do not think this is the atmosphere in which we want to discuss something like balancing the budget, because if the only way to balance the budget is to take it on the backs of children or on people trying to better themselves in life, that is no solution. To me, that runs counter to my understanding of what the American dream is all about.So in that context, then, it seems to me that what is very important here is that we discuss what is actually happening. What actually is happening is that the budget is gradually being balanced, as it should be, without endangering the economy. The deficit declines for the fourth consecutive year in 1996. This is the first time it has happened since the Truman administration. I am going over some of the elements that I have cited before in a little more detail.The traditional Congressional Budget Office baseline projections include discretionary spending at caps established in 1993 and show the deficit rising after 1996 and reaching $210 billion in 2002. This is $18 billion lower than the December projection of this year, and $80 billion lower than April of 1995. In other words, these numbers can change with the wind, but the wind has to be blowing in the right direction.The direction of the budgetary wind is this: That we have a prudent understanding of what it takes to have the budget balance. To simply do it arbitrarily, as is done in this 1997 budget, and to think about the idea of cutting taxes at the same time that you are trying to achieve a balance in the budget and a reduction of the deficit, more than a reduction, the balancing of deficit spending, I think is beyond credibility.I would indicate, Mr. Speaker, because I have had some considerable time to discuss it, and perhaps not all of our colleagues have heard the whole discussion, the hypothesis that I am putting forward, the thesis that I am putting forward, is that if you have as the budget, and the document I am referring to is the budget of the majority, the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives, if we have, as the Committee on the Budget indicates, deficits for every year from 1997 through 2001, and then suddenly find a surplus in the year 2002, it is just not credible. Try and sell that in Ravenswood, WV.I talked with friends there today. I said I was going to make a presentation today. They were interested in what I was going to say, what my premises were going to be. I just asked whether or not this sounded credible, that you could have deficits, declining as they might be right up to 2001, and suddenly come up with a surplus in 2002, and then from 2003 on just watch the deficit expand again.I hope that we are not going to be subject, Mr. Speaker, to Member after Member coming to the well of the House and regaling us with stories about their children and their grandchildren and all this mawkish, overblown rhetoric about how they are so concerned with their children and grandchildren, presumably none of the rest of us are, which I find a little bit farfetched, but rather, if we are so concerned about children and grandchildren, maybe we should be a little more honest with them right now.My fundamental point is this budget does not balance. The budget in 1998 does not balance. The budget in 1999 does not balance. The budget in 2000, 2001, it does not balance. How is it going to balance in 2002? Even if it does on paper, how long is it going to last? Merely the time it takes to say it: ``Oh, the budget is balanced''? Well, it was balanced, because it was balanced when I said it, but now we are 3 seconds beyond that time and it is not balanced anymore. But we balanced it for that moment, on paper, just to go through that allusion. I do not think it is worthy of this Congress to do it.So, Mr. Speaker, I think if we look at 1996 and what we went through, we did not have a balanced budget but we did manage to cut the deficit. We did manage to cut the rate of the deficit. We did hold inflation down. We held steady on interest rates. I think on the whole, then, the President's priorities were met. The majority ultimately voted for a budget that was more in line with the President's priorities, so the President is entitled to credit for sticking to a position with respect to the rate of the deficit reduction under the premises established by the majority in the Congress, the Republican majority, and it worked.Now the President is coming forward again, saying that he would like to see these priorities carried forward on education, on Medicare, on Medicaid and the environment, and that he has certain standards that he desires to maintain under pain of exercising his veto. That is his constitutional right. In fact, it is his obligation as President, even as President Bush and President Reagan before him exercised the veto dozens and dozens of times, most of which we were unable to overcome when we were the majority here in the House of Representatives or the majority in the Senate. They prevailed. That is our constitutional system.It is supposed to be hard to pass legislation in the United States of America. What many people call gridlock is the wheels of government turning precisely the way the Framers of the Constitution intended for them to turn. The Congress of the United States makes policy, yes, but only if it achieve the approbation of the executive. The executive can prevail against the legislative body only if the executive can be sustained in the legislative body. We have the judicial side to see to it that we both keep a proper balance. That is our system.Mr. Speaker, I do not find it regrettable in the least that it is difficult to pass items like the budget. What I find regrettable is that we seem to be passing it so easily this week, Mr. Speaker. That is what bothers me. This is the single most important document with respect to the legislative business and what follows from it that we will have before us this year. It certainly is the most important piece of legislation before the election which is to take place in November. As a result, it seems to me we should be devoting considerable time to it.I appreciate the fact that the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Smith] came down and was willing to spend some time discussing it. I think the import of the arguments that he made essentially supports my position. Of course, I can make that statement now because he has left the floor and cannot taken an opposing position to that, but I think I can extract from what he said at least a reasonable basis for saying, as I have, and indicate again to you at this moment, that we need to be much more gradual about it. To that degree, the President seems to be taking the right approach. He has accepted the will of the majority with respect to the premises upon which it bases its balanced budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office.It is not necessary for me to explain to you, Mr. Speaker, what the Congressional Budget Office is. Suffice it to say that every legislative body relies upon individuals, experts in their field, to make recommendations and to draw upon statistics and information made available to them from their various professional fields and backgrounds in order to complete a picture. In this instance, it is a picture of what the economy is like and what we can expect.This does not mean they are going to be absolutely correct in every instance, but all individual families, all companies, all businesses, all organizations, in fact, all nations, have to utilize the best brains that they have available, accumulate the most knowledge that they can, and try to draw reasonable conclusions as to what the future might bring so they can make decisions. That is all the Congressional Budget Office does with respect to the budget. It makes the best estimate that it can based upon the premises that are agreed upon.In this instance, Mr. Speaker, we have agreed upon premises which, by definition of the budget, do no add up to a balance. I have no objection to passing this budget, Mr. Speaker, with the admonition that we should take up the President's disagreement with respect to the priorities. I voted for the budget previously, and despite my own misgivings, so it is not a question of whether we should vote on a budget, it is question of what the priorities should be.I have no objection to saying that this could be a step in the direction of balancing the budget, if we have the President's priorities involved in it. I do object to us indicating to the American people that somehow this is going to lead to a balanced budget, just as I object to the idea of going through this illusion and farce, which apparently is going to take place in the other body, about passing a balanced budget amendment. The balanced budget amendment will no more achieve a balanced budget than this document does.This does not achieve a balanced budget, and neither does passing the balanced budget amendment accomplish anything of the kind, any more than vows in a marriage guarantee that there will be happiness and prosperity in it. You can have the intention, but unless you put behind it the activity which will ensure that happy consequence, then you cannot claim that it will happen.What I am saying here is if we put forward a budget that says, yes, we will cut spending and we will cut spending in a way that will continue to reduce the deficit over time and we hope at some point then to be able to reach balance, then that is all right. Not only is it all right, but that is the right way to do it.I mentioned a mortgage before. Let me draw the analogy for my colleagues here and for those who may be interested in the record.Just as you are not expected to have cash on hand to buy your house but, rather, you are expected to be able to make your payments, be able to meet your obligations over a period of time, then you can go forward with the purchase of that home and say that you own it. Do you actually own it? No. Because the bank owns it. We are going to have a mortgage-burning ceremony perhaps in 30 years.But that bank is making a bet. That bank is betting that you have the capability and the capacity to make those payments for that period of time. Think about it. Twelve times a month for 13 years. That is pretty good guessing. Perhaps it bespeaks a knowledge of finance and general economic trends that is fairly reliable.Now, that being the case, I think we need to do the same thing with this budget. Let us not con the American people into thinking for a moment that this document is moving toward balancing the budget in the year 2002. It is not true. It is not going to happen. That is irrefutable.On the contrary, he agreed with my premise. It is not going to be balanced because we do not take into account how we are going to pay for all of the money that we borrowed to presumably create the illusion of balancing this budget.What we can do is create over time an ability to pay, a robust economy that will enable us to gradually draw down the amount of the deficit with prudent spending, with a clear understanding of what programs we want to support and why we want to support them and how they benefit the American people, and over that lengthy period of time accomplish this goal. There is nothing not only wrong with that, that is the sensible, practical, reasonable way to do it, because it maximizes the opportunity for the great mass of American people to join in the prosperity, to be able to better themselves in what they want to accomplish for themselves and their family.So I stand here today, Mr. Speaker, I do not think a lonely voice or a single voice. I think I stand here enunciating fairly clearly for the American people, and I hope for my colleagues, most certainly, the idea that we should not utilize the budget process for political purposes merely because there is an election, but we should utilize our opportunity with this budget process to begin to make progress towards reducing the deficit, coming into balance, having the economy grow and seeing a robust, prosperous economy for all.Mr. Speaker, inasmuch as there is only a minute left, I want to thank you for your courtesy today in allowing me to speak and for sharing this time with me. I hope that I have made some contribution today. I intend to, in the future, towards reviewing the 1997 budget and reviewing the whole question of the budget deficit, the budget balance proposition, and seeing to it that all Americans now and in the future are able to enjoy a prosperous future.

As you know, Burma is ruled by a brutal military dictatorship which rejects the mandate of the democratic elections of 1990.Although Aung San Suu Kyi is no longer under house arrest, the military regime has been stepping up its repressive measures against her and her party, the National League for Democracy. As the sixth anniversary of the democratic election approached, over 200 people were arrested. Recently, the regime released half of the detainees. These arrests were the latest example of the egregious human rights situation in Burma.Aung San Suu Kyi and members of the National League for Democracy did not give in to the fear of retribution. They held rallies these past two weekends and will continue to meet.I say to Anug San Suu Kyi, thank you for your courage and devotion to principle, you inspire all of us. You are a very courageous woman, who has endured uncomprehensible hardships.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak out against granting China the most-favored-nation [MFN] status. For many years I have followed the human rights and business violations occurring in China. This past year we have once again seen many problems arise with China.As my colleagues know, last month the United States customs agents arrested suspects in the United States with ties to China's state-owned munitions companies for smuggling AK-47's and other dangerous weapons into the United States. These same companies are selling nuclear weapons technology to Pakistan and advanced missile technology to Iran.Many people claim that if we don't grant MFN status to China that American business will be hurt. That's not true. American businesses are hurt by the Chinese Government allowing piracy of copyrighted American goods. These pirated copies are made in factories with the full knowledge of the Chinese Government. Everyone here is aware that a trade war was barely averted yesterday because the United States and China came to an agreement that is designed to crack down on Chinese piracy of compact discs and computer software.Unfortunately, I don't think the Chinese understand that we are serious about protecting our copyrighted goods. Once again, the Chinese have only been slapped on the wrist for not abiding by agreements made. In the past, MFN status has been granted in hopes that the Chinese Government was going to crack down on the piracy problems and human rights violations. This has not happened yet.Granting MFN to China does not encourage the Chinese Government to correct their human rights violations. Despite China's robust economy and economic reforms, there continues to be widespread human rights abuses. China still places severe restrictions on freedom of speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, privacy, movement and worker rights. In Sunday's Post, it was noted that China's priority for the next 15 years would be to discredit Tibet's exiled religious leader, his Holiness, the Dalai Lama.I ask my colleagues to ask themselves--Why would we want to grant MFN status to a country that continues to ignores human rights violations, continues to replicate American copyrighted goods, smuggles guns into our country, and has given nuclear technology to rogue nations? I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against MFN for China.",

    "title": "LEGISLATION DISAPPROVING THE NRC FROM LOCATING A NUCLEAR WASTE FACILITY",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today with other concerned Members of Congress to introduce legislation which amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to prohibit the licensing of a permanent or interim nuclear waste storage facility outside the 50 States. Specifically, this bill would preclude the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from issuing a license for the storage of radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel in any of the U.S. territories. Senator Daniel Akaka has already introduced a companion bill, S. 1878, in the U.S. Senate.I have grown increasingly troubled by statements and presentations that have been made by a New York City investment firm, KVR, Inc., that earlier this year made an offer for Palmyra Island, an atoll of more than 40 islets 1,000 miles south of Hawaii. Initially, it was reported that KVR. Inc. talked about using Palmyra for scientific research and hotel development of some kind. However, recent events make it evident that KVR, Inc. wants to use Palmyra for a repository of radioactive waste.KVR, Inc. has been circulating draft legislation among the administration and Members of Congress to locate a radioactive waste site on a Pacific atoll. According to representative from KVR, Inc. Palmyra is on a short list of candidate sites being considered.I want to state for the record that I am unequivocally against this initiative.In order to locate the site at Palmyra the draft legislation waives compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act in regard to the preparation of the environmental impact statement and the Clean Water Act to dredging.Siting a radioactive waste facility is a serious matter. The environmental consequences cannot be ignored. For too long the Pacific community has been used as a nuclear dumping ground. The United States tested nuclear devices in the Marshall Islands, and we are all having to deal with the enormous costs associated with these tests. More recently, the Government of France conducted a series of nuclear tests at the Moruroa and Fangatauga atolls in the South Pacific, which was opposed by over 160 nations.Mr. Speaker, my bill is preemptive strike against proposals to designate a radioactive waste site in the Pacific. KVR, Inc. attempts to achieve a laudable goal but at an enormous cost. I want to advise my colleagues that any attempt to go forward with the KVR, Inc. proposal will be vigorously and vehemently opposed.",

    "title": "ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak out against granting most-favored-nation status to China. Many of my colleagues have discussed the various aspects of China's MFN status; I am going to concentrate on the issue of exporting forced labor manufactured products to the United States. The Chinese Government has not complied with the memorandum of understanding on prison labor between the United States and China also known as the MOU.In the MOU, the Chinese acknowledged that exporting forced labor products to the United States is illegal. Key provisions of the MOU state that China will promptly investigate companies or enterprises suspected of violating relevant regulations; they will furnish available evidence and information regarding suspected violations; and they will allow United States officials to visit the respective enterprises or companies.This violation should be important to any working American. Importing products made by convicted, forced or indentured labor in Chinese prison camps takes jobs away from Americans. The United States should not continue granting MFN status to China while it is exporting prison labor products. There are many examples of Chinese and United States companies deliberately violating the law.For example, the Customs Bulletin and Decisions published in the Federal Register on April 23, 1996, reports that certain iron pipe fittings are made using prison labor at the Tianjin Malleable Iron Factory also known as the Tianjin Tongbao Fittings Co., also known as the Tianjin No. 2 Malleable Iron Plant, also known as the Tianjin Secondary Mugging Factory, also known as the Tainajin No. 2 Prison. I'm sure you noticed that the prison goes by many names and is only one example of how the Chinese Government tries to mislead companies and countries on where exported manufactured products are being made.The March 1996 State Department report entitled ``China Human Rights Practices,'' states that cooperation with United States officials has stalled since mid-1995. ``As of the end of 1995, the authorities had not granted access to a prison labor facility since April 30th. * * * As in many Chinese workplaces, safety is a low priority. There are no available figures for casualties in prison industry.''Another example of exported prison labor can be found by examining the Chinese expandable graphite exports. The only mine in China which produces expandable graphite for export is a forced labor camp called the Beishu Laogai Detachment, also known as the Shandong Province Beishu Prison, the Shandong Province Beishu Shengjian Graphite Mine, the Beishu Graphite Mine, and recently the Qingdao Graphite Mine. Producing expandable graphite is dangerous because it involves the extensive use of sulfuric and chromic acid. Shipping records from 1992 to 1995 show that two major customers of the expandable graphite in the United States were the Asbury Graphite Company and China Enterprises.Let me refresh some of my colleagues' memories in the case they don't remember watching the June 1995 Tom Brokaw interview with Steven Riddle, CEO of the Asbury Graphite Co. in New Jersey. During the interview, Mr. Riddle admitted that his company was purchasing expandable graphite from Qingdao Mines, a forced labor camp. In addition, Mr. Riddle admitted that he sometimes worried that his company, Asbury Graphite was violating the law, but ``everybody tends to look the other way.'' We need to stop looking the other way. United States companies should not feel comfortable purchasing forced labor products from China. The U.S. Customs Agency needs to put its foot down and enforce the law.An interesting side note: The Beishu Laogai Detachment was unexpectedly visited on Christmas Day, 1994, by a reporter from the London Sunday Times, named Nick Rufford. He reported that ``Evidence of the use of forced labor was abundant. Inmates marched in double file. Trucks with `Beishu prison' stenciled on the sides in Chinese characters were parked inside the factory gates. Behind the plant stood a walled compound with watchtowers and guards.'' Mr. Rufford reported 3,500 tons of graphite from the mine was shipped to Britain last year.As many of my colleagues know, Amnesty International and other sources have provided ample documentation of the cruel and abusive practices common in Chinese prisons. That abuse, the restricted journals clearly show, is translated directly into hard currency earned in the export trade.For example, in a journal whose readership is restricted to prison officials, a writer laid out the brutal logic of using prison labor for export production: ``Prisoners have become commodity producers. they are cheap and concentrated. They produce labor intensive products.'' It is precisely the goods which fall into the labor intensive category that form the bulk of Chinese exports to the United States.The article also shows that it is common practice in China to forcibly retain so-called labor reform prisoners for indefinite periods beyond the expiration of their terms. the industrial advantages are explained clearly to prison administrators: ``Prisoners retained for in-camp employment * * * can not join labor unions, do not enjoy retirement benefits when they become old, and their wages and living standards are low.''These abuses seal the case against granting China MFN status. China does not play by the rules. China does not reciprocate the trade benefits we grant to them. Despite the fact that over one-third of China's exports are sold into the United States market, China's high tariffs and non tariff barriers limit access to the Chinese market for United States goods and services. Only 2 percent of United States exports are allowed into China. The result is a $34 billion United States trade deficit with China in 1995. This doesn't include any of the stolen intellectual property of the illegally smuggled guns. I strongly urge my colleagues that we no longer reward China's constant violations of agreements. Vote against granting MFN status to China.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gentleman from Colorado, inasmuch as he continues to invoke the name of Hawaii, to at least try to be accurate. I understand the gentleman has his political duty that he is going to do today here, at least as he conceives it. I do not object to that. I do object to his, I must say, making statements like ``Hawaii mandating its wishes on the rest of the Nation''; his constant invocation of what Hawaii intends to do or not do.I daresay that there are not five people in this House of Representatives that have the slightest clue as to what is taking place legislatively or judicially or personally in Hawaii with respect to this issue. I can tell the Members that the individuals involved are constituents of mine, two of whom I know personally.I know that the kind of rhetoric that has been utilized with respect to this issue does not reflect either their wishes or their motivations. I find it at best a question that needs to be answered as to our definition with respect to marriage. I will not use the word hypocritical, but I think others might certainly question the motivation of people who want to define marriage when this Defense of Marriage Act might better be characterized as defense of marriages.If we intend to say that marriage, and we are writing a national marriage law, which is what we want to do here, is between one man and one women, does that mean that we will now write a national divorce law? Because I understand some of the people who are sponsoring this bill are on their second or third marriages. I wonder which one they are defending.I do not object to that. I think people are entitled to make their private relationships what they will and to seek such happiness in this life as they are able to achieve, but I think that when we move into the area of the private relationships of other people, that we at least ought to show some respect for the human context.When the gentleman from Colorado and others speak so glibly of Hawaii and the people who are involved in the legal proceedings there, they forget these are human beings, some human beings that I know personally. All they are trying to do is conduct their lives as reasonable, sober, responsible people seeking their measure of happiness and tranquility in this life, and to try to bring as much as they can into their lives of the values that we cherish in Hawaii, of kindness and responsibility.Mr. Speaker, amendments will be offered to this bill, because this is more than the defense of marriage. It also gets into the question of benefits. We contend and I certainly contend that nothing that is proceeding today in Hawaii and in the courts of Hawaii affects in any way what any other State does. It is quite clear, and I can cite at great length, and I do not have the time obviously now, the fact that other States are able to establish already what they recognize or do not recognize with respect to marriage.The full faith and credit clause has been invoked in our Nation's history very few times, less than half a dozen times, and it involves the custody of children, the protection of children, the interstate capacity to enforce child support laws. That is the kind of thing we have dealt with, serious issues.I do not doubt that it is a serious issue for individuals here as to what constitutes marriage, but to try to utilize Hawaii for some political agenda having to do with, I guess, the elections in November is something that I find nothing less than reprehensible. We can define marriage any way we want in the States right now. This bill has nothing to do with that. Hawaii certainly is not challenging it.In fact, I would like to hear from the gentleman from Colorado or anybody else any indication that the State of Hawaii has ever indicated in any way, shape, or form that it intends to, as the gentleman put it, mandate its wishes on the rest of the Nation. I do not think this is the case, and I do not think this is the bill to do this kind of thing, and certainly not to malign Hawaii in the process.",

    "title": "DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak against H.R. 3396, the Defense of Marriage Act. The title of the bill is puzzling. What are we defending marriage against: divorce, domestic violence, adultery? Can anyone name a single married couple whose union would be strengthened or defended against harm by this legislation? With all the unresolved burning issues facing this institution, it is nothing short of incredible that we would be diverting time and energy away from questions like Medicare, the environment, and the economy on this matter.Supporters of the bill point to what they claim is the danger of same-gender marriage. They say that if a court in Hawaii rules in favor of same-gender couples, other States will then have to give ``full faith and credit'' to the resulting marriages. I'm going to take this opportunity to concentrate on the traditions of our Nation, in particularly the rights of States and the Constitution of the United States. H.R. 3396 is an unnecessary intrusion into the State domain of family law. It tears at the fabric of our Constitution.Historically, States have the primary authority to regulate marriage based upon the 10th amendment of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has supported this constitutional right. In Aukenbrandt versus Richards, 1992, the Court rules that ``without exception, domestic relations has been a matter of state, not federal concern and control since the founding of the Republic.''It is also interesting to note that questions concerning the validity of an out-of-state marriage are generally resolved without reference to the ``full faith and credit'' clause of the U.S. Constitution. States traditionally recognize out-of-state marriages unless they have statutes prohibiting such a union. For example, polygamy is illegal in all States, and in most states certain incestuous marriages are illegal too. States can declare an out-of-state marriage void if it is against the state's public policy or if entered into with the intent to evade the law of the State.Congress has invoked the ``full faith and credit'' clause only five times since the founding of the Republic. The three most recent instances have required each State to give child custody, child support, and protection orders of other States the same faith and credit it gives its own such orders. The Defense of Marriage Act differs in one critical aspect from the legislative enactment passed by the Congress under it full faith and credit power: H.R. 3396 permits sister States to give no effect to the laws of other States.This is a novel and unconstitutional interpretation of the clause. According to a leading constitutional law scholar, Laurence H. Tribe, ``the Constitution delegates to the United States no power to create categorical exceptions to the Full Faith and Credit Clause.''The Supreme Court just recently struck down a Colorado law that targeted gay and lesbians in Romer versus Colorado, This case suggests that the Supreme Court will rule legislation motivated by animus against gays and lesbians unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment unless the legislative classification bears a rational relationship to a legitimate State purpose. In other words, since H.R. 3396 targets a group of people due to their--in the words of Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council--``dangerous lifestyle and behavior,'' it is likely to be struck down by the courts. There is no dire urgency or compelling public interest to pass this measure, which is not only unnecessary but also likely to be found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.In addition, I find it hard to believe how many of my colleagues can justify their support of H.R. 3396 when they are also cosponsors of H.R. 2270. At least 37 Members of the House are cosponsors of both bills. H.R. 2270 would require the Congress to specify the source of authority under the U.S. Constitution for the enactment of laws. Where in article I or anywhere else in the Constitution is the Congress given authority to write a national marriage law? Maybe the sponsors of both bills don't see the contradiction. Maybe they just don't care.Many on the other side of the aisle have been vocal and unceasing in their support for reversing the flow of power away from Washington and back to the States. Well, the laws governing marriage are traditionally and constitutionally under the authority of the States. If there is any area of law to which States can lay a claim to exclusive authority, it is the field of family relations. How can someone reconcile being for States rights while at the same time taking away a basic, constitutional right given to States by the Framers of our Constitution? I strongly encourage my colleagues to allow the States to continue exercising their constitutional rights and not fan the flames of intolerance. As William Eskeridge, Law Professor at Georgetown University, simply stated, ``the reasons to hesitate before adopting this legislation are conservative ones: federalism, original intent and tradition.''Let us remember that the United States draws its strength from the enormous diversity to be found within the borders of our great Nation. Vote against The Defense of Marriage Act.The CHAIRMAN. All time has expired for general debate.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.Mr. Chairman, as long as Hawaii has this incredible power to be able to mandate whatever it decides on the rest of the Nation, I wan thinking that perhaps we could mandate the Hawaii health care system for the other 49 States, so that we would not have to worry about national health care, and we would mandate the weather, if we could, but I think that is even beyond our powers.There is a serious note to be engaged in here, because the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Frank] has to do with the definition. If Members are in fact intending to define marriage nationally in the terms that have been related in the debate so far, they have indicated it is an institution in which we have a secular, sacred duty to maintain the union between a man and a woman.If that is the case, and Members really intend to do this, and we are sincere about covering this as a national definition of marriage, then why do Members not have a national divorce clause in here as well, forbidding it? Where are the criminal penalties associated with adultery? I have heard a continuous drumbeat from some Members here about this union of a man and a woman. If that is the case, I presume, then, Members are going to forbid divorce and most certainly impose penalties with adultery. But I do not see it in here.There appear to be circumstances in which this union of a man and woman can take place in the context of marriage again and again and again. I am not quite sure how the transition is made in Members' definitions, but that is what takes place, all of this within the context that this deficition has to be made in a national context, because of what may or may not happen in Hawaii. But what is left out of this is that the Federal law over and over again, as stated as recently as 1992, and I am quoting the Supreme Court, ``Without exceptions, domestic relations have been a matter of State, not Federal, concern and control since the founding of the Republic.''In this particular instance, it is the State constitution in Hawaii that is the grounds for the suit in Hawaii. The State constitution in Hawaii has particular references to the right of privacy and equal protection that are not found in other constitutions in other States. Therefore, it does not apply.Members should vote for the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Frank] because even if there is a ruling in Hawaii, it does not therefore follow that Pennsylvania or Florida or Illinois or any of the other States have to follow it at all, unless there are similar provisions, and there are judges that would make decisions based on similar interpretations of similar provisions in Members' own State constitutions.The attorneys for the coules that came into court in Hawaii have stated again and again that it is the particular provisions of the Hawaii State Constitution that they are refering to, so it is disingenuous at best for those who want to maintain that this amendment is something that should be voted for to indicate that unless we have this bill today, and unless we defeat the amendment of the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Frank], Members are going to be forced to accept what was a result of a court decision in Hawaii, if it happens to go that way.The State is disputing this at the present time, and may prevail. So unless someone who is in favor of the bill can tell me how the U.S. Constitution reflects the specific provisions in the Hawaii State Constitution, which extend beyond the Federal Constitution the right of privacy and the equal protection based on gender, unless they can explain that, I do not see how Members can deny the validity of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts.I would yield to anybody who can explain to me how the U.S. Constitution, which only deals by implication with the Hawaii State Constitution, will somebody please tell me how the U.S. Constitution and the Hawaii State Constitution are comparable in these two respects, which is the basis for the suit in Hawaii?There are constitutional experts. Do not look puzzled. Members know perfectly well what I am talking about. There is a right to privacy in Hawaii, there is no discrimination based on gender in the Hawaii State Constitution, which does not appear in the U.S. Constitution except by implication, if Members make the argument. In other words, I get no response.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the manager's amendment to H.R. 1975, the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Fairness and Simplification Act. May I say in that regard that I want to thank my colleague and friend, the gentleman from California, Chairman Ken Calvert, and the staff on his side for their fairness in helping to make this as simple a process as possible.As he has indicated in his remarks, this is an issue with which not everyone may be familiar but which is fundamental to the sound fiscal policy with respect to Federal oil and gas royalty fees.I also note the presence on the floor of the chairman of our Committee on Resources, Mr. Young, and I am very pleased to see him here and I appreciate his kindness and fairness. I can no doubt add a few other adjectives, depending on how much I sense from him that he appreciates the same in me. I can see from his body language that he understand the full import of my remarks.Mr. Speaker, the manager's amendment will substitute the language written by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for the language reported by the House Committee on Resources. The primary difference between the House and Senate language is that the Senate language authorizes but does not mandate the Secretary of the Interior to delegate certain royalty management functions to willing and qualified States.This issue has been gone over in detail by the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert], so I will not repeat it.This would resolve my major problem with the bill and removes the President's veto threat on the bill. I would note that during committee consideration of H.R. 1975 I offered an amendment which the majority did not accept at that time that would have made this very change. I am pleased to see that they now concur with me and that there is no reason to require the Secretary of the Interior to transfer the royalty functions to the States.But while there are many positive features in the manager's amendment, it still contains, in my estimation, some flaws. For example, I continue to believe that is no reason to require the Federal Government to pay interest on oil companies' overpayments to the Federal Treasury, especially when these mistakes occur as a result of sloppy accounting or possible sloppy accounting by oil and gas companies. This new benefit for oil and gas corporations will create, again in my estimation, a new Federal debt and possibly cost taxpayers an estimated $44 million between 1997 and 2002 and possibly an additional $10 million in direct spending each year thereafter.However, in the interest of comity, I am willing to take the majority at its word, particularly that of the gentleman from California, Chairman Calvert, and the gentleman from Alaska, Chairman Young, and accept the administration's assurance that this provision will not be allowed to be abused by the oil and gas lessees. Knowing the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young] as I do, I doubt that anybody can get away with anything.Improvement is always in order, and the majority has worked diligently with the Clinton administration to effect this compromise and, I would like to reiterate, has worked diligently with the minority on the committee as well. If we are to govern, then we must be willing to accept compromises. I do so with this bill, and in this context and in this spirit of comity, we do not object to the passage of H.R. 1975, as amended by the bill's manager, and recommend its acceptance.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 1975, the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act. H.R. 1975 would streamline our Federal royalty collection system by improving the management of royalties from Federal and outer continental shelf oil and gas leases.Currently, about $4.2 billion is collected annually by the Federal Government in mineral receipts--our Nation's third largest revenue source. However, reform of our Nation's royalty collection system has been needed for some time. H.R. 1975 achieves the goals set out by the administration, the States, and industry to provide simplicity and fairness in the partnership between the Federal Government and the leaseholders of Federal lands.Specifically, this legislation would establish a clear statute of limitations on royalty collection, expand existing delegation to States provisions, and set time limits on administrative appeal decisions. This legislation also provides marginal well relief by reforming royalty collections for low-production wells--an issue of great importance to my home State of Texas.At a time when we continue to see increasing reliance on oil imports, this legislation provides the necessary relief to enhance domestic production in both an economically efficient and environmentally sound way. In addition, H.R. 1975 would help Congress in its efforts to balance the budget by providing an additional $51 million in royalties over the next 7 years.H.R. 1975 is supported by the administration, a bipartisan delegation of Members from Congress as well as 14 of our Nation's Governors who represent most of our Federal onshore production. It is also supported by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission and industry trade associations representing our Nation's Federal lessees. I urge my colleagues to support royalty simplification and fairness by voting in favor of H.R. 1975.",

Let me assure you that the Administration remains committed to ensuring the efficient management of Federal lands and finding new ways for the States to work cooperatively and creatively with the Federal Government. The President shares your hope that an agreement can be reached on the State delegation issue. In an effort to resolve this issue, Administration representatives, working with the staff of the Senate Energy Committee, were successful in reaching an agreement on language that would expand the list of delegable royalty management authorities, without reducing the Secretary of the Interior's responsibility with respect to the management of Federal lands. That language was included in S. 1014, which was reported out of the Senate Energy Committee on May 1st. The Administration supports S. 1014 as reported out of committee, but will seek a minor technical amendment. The Administration believes this bill's State delegation language is acceptable, unlike the language included in H.R. 1975, the House Resources Committee bill on Royalty Simplification. The Administration will continue to work with Congress as the legislative process moves forward, and stands ready to work in support of the language included in the Senate Energy Committee bill. I appreciate your interest and support in this important legislation. Sincerely, Leon E. Panetta, Chief of Staff.Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",

We have had the extensive cooperation and support again of the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert], our able chair, and of the chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young], for which I am very appreciative.H.R. 3249 would extend authorization for the Mining Institute to promote environmentally responsible mining technology development for the recovery of the minerals from our Nation's seabed. This type of technology, Mr. Speaker, is critical to the future of mining in the United States, and I am very pleased that this is recognized, again on a bipartisan basis, and am very thankful for the individual encouragement from the chairman of the full committee and the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert].Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in strong support of H.R. 3249, the Mining and Mineral Resources Institutes Act. This is legislation that was drafted and introduced in the true spirit of bipartisanship by the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Wicker] and myself.H.R. 3249 would extend authorization for a mining institute to promote environmentally responsible technology development for the recovery of minerals from the Nation's seabed. This type of technology is critical to the future of mining in the United States.H.R. 3249 is not a new Government program. Previously, the marine mining program was carried out under the Mineral Institutes Program within the Bureau of Mines. Last year the decision was made to terminate the Bureau of Mines. Yet, worthwhile functions of this agency still deserve and need support. One such example is in the Marine Mineral Technology Center of the Mineral Institutes Program. The executive branch, recognizing the value of this program, transferred this program to the Minerals Management Service.The Marine Mining Technology Center program is a unique cooperative program involving leading universities with expertise in applied problems in marine resources and the marine environment. The program is singular because for a relatively small sum of Federal seed money to State institutions and small research organizations, we have seen a prodigious amount of practical research and development accomplished. Additionally, as a byproduct, a number of high-quality graduate students have gained practical hands-on experience. The center's program of research, technology development, and education is multidisciplinary and international in scope.Currently, the marine mining program is carried out by the Continental Shelf Division, located at the University of Mississippi, and the Oceans Basins Division at the University of Hawaii. The University of Hawaii program has been assisted by matching funds from the State of Hawaii because of its critical input to State cooperative development programs, as well as university research and education. Practical aspects of the program have included major inputs to an environmental impact statement on cobalt crusts in the exclusive economic zone [EEZ] of the Hawaiian and Johnston Islands, State programs on sand for the preservation of Hawaii's beaches and coastal environment, and the cleanup of military ordinance from the offshore areas of Kaho'olawe Island, recently returned to the native Hawaiian people by the Navy.This program merits continued Federal support. I am hopeful that we will see this legislation proceed expeditiously through the Senate so that President Clinton can sign it into law this year.In that light, Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 3198, a bill that would reauthorize the 1992 Geologic Mapping Act through fiscal year 2000, and amend the act to designate that 20 percent of the total amount appropriated be allocated to the State component of the program. I would note that both the Clinton administration and the State Geologists support this bill.Congress enacted the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992--Public Law 102-285 and 43 U.S.C. sections 31a-h--in order to expedite the production of a geologic map data base for the Nation, which can be applied to land-use management, assessment, and utilization, conservation of natural resources, groundwater management, and environmental protection. The act designated the U.S. Geological Survey as the Federal agency responsible for planning, coordinating, and managing the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program. This program is carried out by a consortium of geologic mapping partners including State geological Surveys, universities, other Federal agencies, and the USGS.Geologic maps are the primary data base for nearly all applied and basic earth science investigations. Federal agencies, State and local governments, private industry, and the general public depend on the information provided by geologic maps. The current geologic map data base is inadequate to meet these needs and development of a comprehensive nationwide program of geologic mapping is required at a pace that responds to increasing demand for mapping in high-priority areas. The States and the USGS each conduct a yearly, needs-based survey to determine program priorities.Improved geologic map information has been shown, using benefit-cost analyses, to be of significant value in many decisionmaking processes, including:Exploring for and developing mineral, energy, and water resources;Screening and characterizing sites for toxic and nuclear waste disposal;Land use evaluation and planning for environmental protection;Earthquake hazards reduction;Predicting volcanic hazards;Designing and constructing infrastructure requirements such as utility lifelines, transportation corridors, and surface-water impoundments;Reducing losses from landslides and other ground failures;Mitigating effects of coastal and stream erosion; andSiting of critical facilities.I urge my colleagues to support enactment of this bill.Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",

South Korean visitors to the United States spent nearly $2 billion in 1995. This means economic growth and jobs for Americans particularly those in States most visited by South Koreans: California, New York, Hawaii, Guam, Nevada, Arizona, Illinois, and Washington, DC. All indications show that this boom is just the beginning. Today, South Korea has the 11th largest economy in the world and is the 6th largest United States trading partner. We need to take positive advantage of this new phase of South Korean prosperity.Unfortunately, the United States continues to restrict Korean travelers by not allowing South Korea to participate in the Visa Waiver Pilot Program [VWPP]. Although many more Koreans would like to visit the United States, they find the visa process to cumbersome. Today, the United States lags behind Canada, Australia, and other countries in cornering the Korean tourist market.The bill I offer with Mr. Jay Kim would establish a visa waiver pilot program for nationals of Korea who are traveling in tour groups to the United States. Under this bill, Korean visitors are allowed for a period of not more than 15 days. The bill would also establish special bond and notification requirements for tour operators. These include the posting of a $200,000 bond and approval by the Secretary for a tour operator's application to escort tour groups to the United States.As we work to strengthen our economy in this country, I am confident that increased revenues generated from Korean visitors will be most welcomed.",

In the brief time that I was here in 1986, I had the opportunity to participate in activities of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, and had the opportunity when I was elected in 1990 to again join that committee.I say ``opportunity,'' because it was there that I, I am sure, had an experience that has been shared with many, many other Members of the House of Representatives, the chance to listen to and to observe and to absorb the perspective and analysis of ocean policy that was the forte of the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Studds]. There are few people in this body, perhaps in the history of this body, better able to articulate their thoughts, particularly with respect to ocean policy, environmental policy.I think Mr. Studds is universally respected for his intellect and for the depth of his perspective on these issues. As the gentleman from California [Mr. Farr] and the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] have indicated, I doubt whether there is anyone in this body, including the renowned gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Frank], who has a quicker wit, a brighter intelligence, a sense of himself entirely self-contained, as opposed to perhaps some others in this body, someone who understands his role and has illuminated many, many corners which would otherwise remain abstract and obscure to the rest of us.It is always a lesson in oratory, I think, as well as perspective, to be able to listen to Mr. Studds outline for those of us who may not be entirely familiar with the legislation at hand, particularly in regard to the ocean, ocean policy, and fisheries, to be able to listen to him enumerate and elucidate for us on those areas, and come to not only a good understanding but solid commitment. I think that is why, as has been indicated, bipartisan support for so much in the way of ocean policy has been forthcoming, is because Gerry Studds has been able to articulate for all Members of the body not entirely familiar with the legislation exactly what it was about, exactly what the implications were, exactly what was in the national interest, and therefore was able to gain the approbation and good will of virtually every Member of the body for legislation that would otherwise be very difficult to comprehend.I really wish him the very best in whatever it is that he will be doing, but I can say with assurance, Mr. Speaker, that this body will be the poorer for him taking leave of it.Mr. Speaker, I rise today, then, to voice my support for H.R. 3487, the aforementioned National Marine Sanctuaries Preservation Act. I, too, wish to thank the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] and others on the committee, both Republican and Democrat, who have worked so hard in this reauthorization. This bipartisan piece of legislation was introduced by the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] and the gentleman from California [Mr. Farr]. I think the description they gave of the process by which it has arrived here today is an exact one. It was a pleasure to work with both of them. Hawaii is one of the 14 major areas where National Marine Sanctuaries, of which the prime objective is to protect our marine resources, have been designated and are in various stage of implementation. In fact, the final environmental impact statement/management plan on the designation of the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale Sanctuary is set to be released later this month.In particular, H.R. 3487, thanks to the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] and the gentleman from California [Mr. Farr], contains two provisions specific to the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary Act regarding the designation of the waters around the Island of Kaho'olawe for inclusion in the sanctuary and the prohibition of the establishment of user fees in the sanctuary.May I add parenthetically, Mr. Speaker, that this is a good example of the hard work and detailed work that had to go into this bill. I am sure the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] and the gentleman from California [Mr. Farr] would agree that virtually every one of the sanctuaries has unique capabilities and unique qualities that require particular individual attention, and the National Marine Sanctuaries Preservation Act is a prime example of how you have to suit legislation to the particular, and that you cannot put together a bill where one size will literally fit all. It cannot happen in this particular kind of legislation. The only way it can succeed is if you have Members who are willing to do their homework and be able to understand the particular necessities associated with each of the sanctuaries.Mr. Speaker, these provisions, the ones I mentioned with regard to Kaho'olawe, were brought to the attention of the Hawaii delegation by State officials as a result of meetings with the Sanctuary Advisory Council. This council was established to empower local communities to provide advice and recommendations to the sanctuary manager on the development and continued management of the site.Currently, the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale Sanctuary Act requires the Secretary of Commerce to make an annual finding concerning the suitability for the inclusion of the sanctuary of waters within 3 nautical miles of Kaho'olawe Island. However, the language included in H.R. 3487 provides that the Kaho'olawe Island Reserve Commission may request the Secretary of Commerce to include the waters surrounding Kaho'olawe into the sanctuary.If a determination of inclusion is made, the Secretary will provide notice to the Governor of Hawaii and prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement and management plan and any necessary implementing regulations in accordance with the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, the Sanctuary, and the National Environmental Policy Act.The Kaho'olawe provision puts the management of Kaho'olawe and the waters surrounding the island into the hands of the Kaho'olawe Island Reserve Commission. Furthermore, it protects the rights of the State of Hawaii and the Secretary to terminate inclusion of Kaho'olawe Island waters if the supplemental management plan, any implementing regulation or any term of the plan or regulation is unacceptable.In 1992, the initial boundaries of the Hawaiian Islands Sanctuary Act were designated. However, the waters around the island of Kaho'olawe, which were previously used by the Department of Defense as a weapons range, was purposely excluded.In 1993, the Governor of Hawaii signed an act which established and created the aforementioned Kaho'olawe Island Reserve Commission to oversee the departments and agencies of the State with respect to the management of the island reserve. It was further stipulated that the reserve shall be used solely and exclusively and reserved in perpetuity for the preservation and practice of all rights customarily and traditionally exercised by native Hawaiians for cultural, spiritual, and subsistence purposes; for the preservation and protection of the reserve's archaeological, historical, and environmental resources, rehabilitation, revegetation, habitat restoration, and preservation; and for education.In 1994, a memorandum of understanding between the U.S. Department of the Navy and the State of Hawaii conveyed the island of Kaho'olawe back to the State.The Department of the Navy in conjunction with the Kaho'olawe Island Reserve Commission has issued an informational draft request for proposals for the clean-up of Kaho'olawe. Issuance of the final RFP will occur after completion of the use plan for the island and several Navy-State agreements required by the Kaho'olawe memorandum of understanding.The second provision regards the prohibition of user fees in the sanctuary. This language was included as a result of concerns expressed by the State regarding the potential impacts of the sanctuary on local communities; this in the context that I previously outlined with respect to native Hawaiian customs, et cetera. Specifically, the language states that the Secretary of Commerce shall not institute any user fee under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act for any activity within the Hawaii Islands National Marine Sanctuary or any use of the Sanctuary or its resources, again in the context previously enumerated.Mr. Speaker, these two provisions will provide for the better management of the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale Marine Sanctuary. I most urgently ask all my colleagues to support H.R. 3487.Mr. Speaker, may I again thank the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] and the gentleman from California [Mr. Farr] for their hard work on this bill.",

    "title": "CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1996",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 919, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act amendments. These amendments are especially important for States like Hawaii that will benefit from an increase in the small State minimum for the distribution of funds under the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act.Under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, services and shelter for victims of domestic violence are provided by the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act to States on a population basis. Small population States receive a minute allocation under this act of $200,000, or 1 percent, whichever is less. S. 919 would increase the minimum allocation to $400,000 so small States can receive a fair share of the new funding available under the Violence Against Women Act.In the State of Hawaii, the percentage of homicides that were committed by family members is now seen as twice the national average, and it is my hope that increased funding and focus for Hawaii's domestic violence shelters and services can turn this frightening statistic around.Mr. Speaker, I wanted to go over a bit of the chronology of events as to how this report now reaches us on the floor because I think it is instructive not only for the membership, but for the community at large, as to how a matter that is seen as having tremendous public impact and community impact is able to be dealt with by the Congress. I think it is a lesson, a civics lesson, if my colleagues will, Mr. Speaker, in how to deal with drastic circumstances that are not otherwise amenable to being resolved in the community minus the legislative support of the Congress.In the course of that I want to compliment the office of the gentleman from Delaware [Mr. Castle], the staff in his office, and I most especially want to thank the ranking member, the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Kildee], and his staff, and I want to recognize and commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goodling], and his staff, for recognizing in turn how important this amendment was in seeing it through the entire conference. It is the kind of thing that can easily be lost unless there is an alert staff as well as an alert Chair and ranking member who have the good of the community at heart, and most particularly, those most vulnerable, the innocent among us, our children.I had received a letter, Mr. Speaker, from Governor Benjamin Cayetano, the Governor of our State of Hawaii, asking for support of the amendment and indicating that he was aware of how important the change from $200,000 to $400,000 would be. I got that in July. I am citing the specific times, Mr. Speaker, because I want to show how it is possible for the Congress to act with a concerted effort and respond rapidly, and this is an excellent example of it.I drafted a letter, a ``Dear Colleague'' letter, to Members, and I am very pleased that the gentlewoman from Hawaii, Mrs. Mink, my colleague, and the gentleman from Delaware, Mr. Castle, were the original signers of the letter, and we consulted with the staff of Mr. Goodling's committee, and we sent a ``Dear Colleague'' letter out to Members whose districts and whose States were affected. We invited them to sign a letter to Chairman Goodling of the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities in support of increasing the minimum, and I would like to quote, if I might, Mr. Speaker, briefly from the letter to Mr. Goodling because I think it provides, again, an example and a basis for understanding how legislation can be brought promptly to the floor in a way that effectively serves the ends sought.In addressing the chairman we wrote requesting his support for increasing the small State minimum in the distribution of funds. Small States were guaranteed a minimum, as I indicated, of $200,000. Congress recently increased the appropriation from $32 million in fiscal year 1995 to $47 million in 1996. Unfortunately, the small State minimum did not receive a comparable increase; thus States which we represented, those of us who signed the letter to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goodling], Alaska, Delaware, Washington, DC, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia and Wyoming did not benefit from the funding increase. Small States, of course, have the same pressing needs as large States to provide adequate services for women who have been the victims of domestic violence. Consequently we believed that it was imperative that the small State minimum be increased. The Senate had already increased the small State minimum to $400,000 in the Child Abuse and Prevention Treatment Act and was expected to include it.Mr. Speaker, the Senate, as I said, expected to include this provision in the Labor, HHS and Education appropriations bill but obviously required support of the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goodling] and the conferees in the conference. The result, Mr. Speaker, is before us today. It has been accomplished. In other words, between July and September of this year on a bipartisan basis, we were able to deal with this crisis. Small States were recognized, and more importantly, the children and those others who come under the aegis of this act were recognized as being in need. So I would like to close with a profound sense of gratitude to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goodling] and the committee and indicate that I hope that this will, if it has to be voted on, will be a unanimous vote of the Congress and offer in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, again a reference to the fact that it is possible for men and women of good will and acting in faith with the Constitution and our duties here in the House to act promptly on behalf of the children of this country.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, before I begin I want to say that I had the opportunity, in fact the privilege, of being in the Committee on Ways and Means the other day when the portrait of Mr. Young was unveiled. I want to take this opportunity to publicly thank him for his untiring efforts on behalf of the causes associated with the Committee on Resources. Regardless, Mr. Speaker, of what one's views might or might not be on any given issue, one can always count on the fact that in dealing with Chairman Young we are dealing with a man of unquestioned integrity, whose commitment to this Nation and to the Committee on Resources has been unfailing. I want to say to him, Mr. Young, that one of the singular privileges of my political life has been to serve with you.Mr. Speaker, I rise, with certain regrets, in support of H.R. 4168, a bill to close the Federal Helium Program. In these days of downsizing, it seems the time has come to terminate programs which appear to have outlived their usefulness, like the Federal Helium Program.Since 1925, when the Defense Department believed that dirigibles, or blimps, would be an integral part of our national defense, the Federal Government has managed a helium program. Today, the Federal Helium Program continues to serve the needs of major Federal users of helium, such as NASA and DOE laboratories.The Federal Government got involved in helium production at a time when there was no private helium production. Today, however, the private sector manufactures 90 percent of the world's helium production. For this reason, groups such as the National Taxpayers Union, the 20/20 TV program, the Interior Department inspector general, and the Heritage Foundation have called for its elimination.H.R. 4168, like its predecessor H.R. 3008 in this Congress and H.R. 3967 in the 103d Congress, enjoys bipartisan support. While I did not support termination of the program, I recognize that, after several years of consideration, Congress is poised to resolve the question of the helium program by terminating it. But, I remain concerned that we have not done enough to aid the 200-plus employees in Amarillo, TX, who will lose their livelihood as a consequence of our decision.During committee consideration of this bill, I offered an amendment to provide employee benefits in addition to those authorized under existing law, so that the 200-plus employees in Amarillo--many of whom have built their careers on this program--would get the same kind of additional education and job placement assistance that we gave defense employees working at bases that were closed. These are people--men and women--who through no fault of their own find themselves working for a Federal program targeted for downsizing. My amendment would have given these people help in addition to what the Secretary is already authorized to provide. The same kind of help that we have provided to many of the defense employees working at military bases scheduled for closure--job placement assistance, extended life and health insurance coverage and the option to take an early retirement without penalty.Sadly, my Republican colleagues could not be persuaded to provide this type of much-needed aid. During committee debate, my colleague, Representative Calvert argued that the Secretary already has the authority to provide these benefits. This is simply incorrect. My amendment would have added authority necessary to enable the Secretary to extend health and life insurance coverage for 3 years beyond an employee's termination; the Secretary does not have the ability to provide this assistance under current law. My amendment would have allowed Federal helium employees access to the enhanced early retirement option; current law does not provide for this protection. My amendment would have given Federal helium employees hiring preference governmentwide--not just in the Amarillo area as is provided for under existing law.So, my amendment failed. And even though I agreed with my colleague, Representative Mac Thornberry, that we don't need to terminate this program, I could see that the bill would pass. So I tried to lessen the blow so that the helium workers might be able to find another Federal job, or if they had served 20 years, take an early out and retire from civil service. But, this was not to be.These activities would have been paid from the existing helium account, and would have cost relatively pennies especially in comparison to the costs of unemployment payments. The CBO said that my amendment would have no budgetary effect.It seemed only fair to offer this assistance to the innocent victims of our downsizing zeal. So that the employees--who had nothing to do with the difficulties facing the program--would not be left stranded by their Government. But, my Republican colleagues could not see their war clear to help their fellow public servants. And so, today, we will pass H.R. 4168 under suspension of the rules so we can praise ourselves for making Government smaller. I just wish we could have done so in a more humane and compassionate manner. I am somewhat consoled by the information that provision for unemployment benefits has been included in the Interior appropriations conference report.",

So I trust that all Members will recognize and abide by the request of the chairman.I have little to add, Mr. Speaker, but rather to supplement just briefly. As indicated, we are asking the House to sign compromise language reauthorizing the National Marine Sanctuaries bill back from the other body in the hope that it will send the bill to the President before adjournment.This bill contains all that the bill we passed previously does. It embodies the House-Senate compromise, as had been indicated, that has bipartisan support. And I want to state that for the record. It most certainly is acceptable to the administration.I want to emphasize that it provides a generous 3-year reauthorization for the program and contains many of the miscellaneous provisions, some of which the chairman pointed out, principally, to enhance the management of individual marine sanctuaries and to give NOAA the authority to raise private funds for sanctuary activities. I think the latter is particularly important.All around, this is the kind of legislation that has been the rule rather than the exception from our Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans for much the same reasons as outlined by the chairman. I commend him for his hard work and the cooperation of him and the staff and the cooperation of many other individuals on the subcommittee and Committee of the Whole for this bill and the many others that we have had come before us.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield, carrying Mrs. Mink's point a bit further, is it not interesting, is it not instructive that the French think that they can move ahead with this testing and at the same time condemn the activities or the presumed activities with respect to testing or the utilization of atomic or hydrogen weapons by Iran or Iraq or Pakistan or the People's Republic of China.Is it not clear that by France, ostensibly one of our allies, despite the fact that it has never cooperated with us in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as a member of the Committee on National Security, I can say that one of our great difficulties with respect to European security is never being able to know where France will be. Will they be behind us? Will they be beside us? If they are behind us, what do they have in mind for us? What do they have in mind for Europe?We find ourselves in the position of attempting to establish a standard with respect to testing, asking other countries to follow our lead in ending the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons as an act of common humanity on behalf of all the nations on the planet.And when France moves ahead with this kind of testing, how do we have the moral authority then to be able to say to Iran, to Iraq, to India, to Pakistan, to China, where do we get the moral authority then to be able to say, no, you should cease this kind of activity?It very quickly becomes an argument in which the Western Powers, those who are conceived of as the Western Powers by history, the imperialist colonial powers, are allowed to do as they will with respect to atomic or hydrogen testing and somehow, then, those countries which have been viewed as unindustrialized or Third World or whatever kind of set of adjectives are put upon them, those countries are disenabled from being able to do the same thing that France now carries on.France undermines everything that we have tried to do since atomic testing and hydrogen testing took place, since all of us, from President Kennedy on, on a bipartisan basis in this country, came to the conclusion that this was against the interests of humanity. This goes beyond individual political machinations or individual political posturing. This goes to the very heart of what constitutes a responsible nation in the present-day world acting in a manner in concordance with those actions that promote peace. We are not in a position, then, to complain to other countries about possible testing that they may be doing if we are unable to discipline ours sufficiently to be able to say to France, we will not countenance this.Now, it is one thing, perhaps, for the President to say, look, there are wider considerations. It may even be that the State Department wants to say there are wider considerations. That may be so. An argument may be made. I think it can be refuted and should be refuted. But I do not pretend to have some corner on the market of political wisdom in that respect. It perhaps should be debated.But, to have the Speaker's chair occupied, the podium of the House of Representatives occupied by the President of France under these circumstances is beyond my comprehension. It is a privilege of the House, a privilege of the House to stand on the podium where the Speaker resides and to speak to the House assembled.We are forced into the position of saying that we must boycott this speech, this address to the House of Representatives, and we request our I hope you will not resent the fact that I think we can go back a little further, World War I. Who was it that left the shores of the United States to go and rescue France in World War I? Who went to rescue France in World War II? And it is a sad chapter, one that still has not been resolved in our own country, who then, with the best of intentions, tried to go into Vietnam in the wake of the disaster that the French created there in Indochina? It was the United States, for good or for ill. We have no apologies that we need to make to the French about taking a position with respect to testing in the Pacific.Some could say to us, yes, of course, the gentleman from Samoa, the people from Hawaii, they live in the Pacific, I suppose we could be seen almost as a special interest in that regard.",

My good friend, the gentleman from American Samoa, has made it clear that the United States, too, is a Pacific Nation; that this is not some isolated event in a faroff place.I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that this is something that very much needs the bipartisan attention of the House. I would hope that the Speaker would reconsider the question of whether or not Mr. Chirac should be allowed to speak, because I maintain that far from being a scientific test, that the information that could have been gained from the testing, ostensibly gained from the testing, we would have been happy to share. The United States of America would have been happy to share.I can say as a member of the Committee on National Security, without violating any sense of clearances or restricted data or anything of the kind, classified data, the information to be gained here is common knowledge to those who will take the time to find out what was required or what kind of knowledge was sought with respect to the effects of this kind of testing, if that was indeed the rationale for it.I maintain, Mr. Speaker, that this was a political statement by the French. They were doing this for political reasons, and precisely because, and I will not dispute anyone with whether or not this was a good political idea or a bad political idea. It was done for reasons that seemed good enough at the time to the French Government, and as a result, and whatever statement they wanted to make, they were willing to take the chance of opprobrium from the rest of the world if they went ahead with these tests in order to make their political statement.I maintain, Mr. Speaker, and I would hope that the leadership of the House would take this into account with respect to my request for reconsideration of whether this speech moves forward, it is a political statement to have someone stand at the Speaker's desk, at the Speaker's chair and the podium, on the floor of the House of Representatives. That is a political statement. It says that you have the privilege of the floor, freely granted by the Members of this House. That I was a political statement.So if the French exploded these bombs for political reasons, are we not saying, then, if we give him the privilege of the floor, that we are, in effect, approving that; that he can do this with no political disadvantage, there is no political price to pay?All we ask, Mr. Speaker, and perhaps there is a protocol situation that the Speaker cannot now rescind, and perhaps not all of this was taken into consideration, but I ask this, then: If the privilege of the floor cannot be rescinded at this time, and I most seriously and parenthetically emphasize, reemphasize, reiterate, that I hope the Speaker and the leadership will reconsider the question of whether Mr. Chirac should be given the privilege of this House to speak from the Speaker's podium.But in the event that that is not possible, I ask, because it is a political statement and will be a political statement to be on this floor, that people boycott this floor; that the cameras that will be in here to record this event ",

The President, and the gentleman and the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Ms. DeLauro] have been on this floor with me many times in this special order process, and I think we would agree, and I think the Record would reflect, that over and over and over again at that podium and at that podium on the other side of the aisle the mantra was enunciated: ``Give us a balanced budget as scored by the Congressional Budget Office in 7 years, to be enacted in the year 2002, and that's the end of it for us. That is all we want the President to do. That's all we want the Democratic Party to do, give us a balanced budget in 7 years as certified by the Congressional Budget Office.''Now, my understanding is, and I think I can read as well as, certainly, the Speaker of the House can, I think my academic credentials are in at least as much order as his, the President did precisely that. He presented a 7-year balanced budget as certified by the Congressional Budget Office. The problem was the Speaker did not like the numbers or how it was achieved, so he moved the goalposts.",

He managed to do that.Now, the fact that the Speaker is upset that the President actually accommodated him on what was requested, he is attempting to recoup by attaching his desires not with respect to a balanced budget, but some new prospect for a balanced budget that remains beyond me in terms of how he wants to accomplish it, by attaching it to the debt resolution.",

Well, I take it similarly as a compliment to be on Mr. Gingrich's target list.Mr. Speaker, I notice that one of our colleagues has come to the floor. I take it that he is maybe making an inquiry whether he might have been able to take some of the time from one of the previous speakers from the Republican side.Have I guessed correctly on that?",

    "text": "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.I think that was a good example, Mr. Speaker, of the fact that we do have comity on this floor. Some of our colleagues might think we are spelling that ``comedy'' rather than ``comity'' but I think that you and I both are committed to this institution.I have been the beneficiary of your wisdom, Mr. Speaker, and your leadership in this House, and I would hope that I could make a similar contribution in whatever role I find myself on this floor or in any committee, in any post. I think we both view this as a privilege that has been given to us, an honor bestowed by the voters in our districts. But as I indicated, nonetheless, this is an institution in which the politics of this country are played out in a setting which I think is most appropriate for coming to those decisions.In the process of engaging in political debate, inevitably sides are taken. I think perhaps that is one of the reasons why for some individuals they fail to understand that, the proposition, well, why can they not all get along? Why is there what is called bickering?I would hope, Mr. Speaker, you and I have never been in a position of bickering with one another. I think we have probably had a division of thought and philosophy and possibly policy at one time or another, and other times we were not only able to agree but to work in concert with one another toward a common goal, seeking to achieve it. Nonetheless, there are different political philosophies that are put forward by individuals who put themselves up for public office, and people make a decision on those philosophies.So as a result, we often find ourselves in opposition to one another, not necessarily personally, Mr. Speaker, but in terms of political parties and policies that might or might not be pursued.I say all of this by way of preliminary remarks because, as I indicated before my friend from Connecticut came to the floor, there was this list that was put together. I suppose it had a bit of drama attached to it because of the press, journalists categorizing it a certain way, but it was called the enemies list and it was associated with Well, for the 1990's, we have a list, too. The Speaker of the House, Mr. Gingrich, has put together a list, a target list, for next year--I should say for this year, rather--for the congressional elections this year, some 20 to 30 Members of the Congress who are being targeted by Mr. Gingrich for defeat in November for one reason and another, I presume perhaps because of opposition on policies, perhaps, I would hope, effective refutation of the Speaker's positions.In any event, I find myself on that list. I am one of the Speaker's targets this year. I am on the Gingrich target list. I do take that as a compliment. I am very pleased to be on it. I trust and hope that perhaps some of the commentary that I have been making on the budget, and on what I see as the lack of solid policy on Mr. Gingrich's part and his leadership with respect to the budget, I hope that some of the things I have had to say have led him to designate me as a target in this upcoming election.I am very pleased to be recognized. It is not always those of us from some of the smaller States at such great distance, particularly being out in Hawaii, where we would certainly welcome the Speaker after the election in November, hopefully as the ex-Speaker. We will be happy to have him come out and take a little rest with us out there, and I will be happy to provide some hospitality for him, and I certainly hope to be in the victors column when that election takes place despite being a target.But I bring this up about being a target because I do not want to deceive any one of our colleagues who may be tuned in, or others who may have access to our deliberations here, that I am anything other than partisan when it comes to defending what I believe are the interests of the people of the United States, the public interest of the United States with respect to the budget and with respect to the other issues that I have a difference with the Speaker on, and apparently have contributed to me being this target.As the target, I invite the Speaker yet once again to come to the floor. I have done this in the past and do it now.I recall at one point being in the chair, even as the Speaker is now, and had the opportunity to listen to with great interest, Mr. Gingrich's recitation on various subject matters having to do with policy. He has indicated that as Speaker that he does not deal with the day-to-day floor activity here. He has entrusted that to Mr. Armey and his whip structure.He says now that the deal, the supposed deal or the possibility of a deal on the budget has broken down with the White House. So he does not have anyplace to go, I guess, in the afternoons now that he is not speaking with Mr. Clinton, so he should have the time to come down here.Inasmuch as I am going to be a target, I would like to deal with the issues that apparently have upset him, particularly with regard to the budget or any other issue that has caused me to be put into this position by Mr. Gingrich. I invite him to do so. I would like to think that our academic backgrounds, perhaps, might be an inducement to lecture. I suppose some people might see what we are doing here in special orders as lectures, but that is all right. I think it is good to have the opportunity to lay out, in a detailed and comprehensive way, one's position.So I invite him once again and would be happy to see him and yield him time, any time that he wishes to take advantage of it.In the meantime, let me then state a couple of propositions with respect to the budget process and build upon the commentary that I have made to this point. Mr. Speaker, perhaps you recall a bit of my discussion with the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Doggett, in the hour just passed in which I indicated that I thought perhaps, I will not say the Speaker, Speaker Gingrich, misspoke himself, but perhaps I would characterize it as being a bid disingenuous in indicating to the public that he thought that is was not possible to have a balanced budget agreement with the President this year.Now, I am sure you will agree, Mr. Speaker, that I have been very reluctant to endorse the bona fides, if you will, of a 7-year balanced budget agreement, whether it was certified by the Congressional Budget Office or by the Office of Management and Budget which is the Executive accountants, if you will, the scorekeeper. The Congressional Budget Office is our; the Congress', the Legislative scorekeepers. I am reluctant to believe that this could be done without causing a great deal of pain regardless of whether it is a Democratic budget, Republican budget or anybody else's budget. But nonetheless, the indications from the Republican side of the aisle, from the office of the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Gingrich], was that if the President would only present to the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Gingrich] a 7-year balanced budget as certified by the Congressional Budget Office, that that would be sufficient unto the day, that would involve the kinds of savings the Speaker was looking for, et cetera. Over and over again, the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Gingrich] and other Members of the majority would come to the floor and state with no equivocation, ``Just give us a 7-year balanced budget as certified by the Congressional Budget Office, and have got a deal.''Well, Mr. Clinton did that. I have my reservations about the bookkeeping, as I indicated, in that just as I do with the Republican proposal. I think I have gone over that in detail before. There are all kinds of gimmicks associated with it. There are all kinds of bookkeeping maneuvers and tricks, all kinds of accounting gambits that put such a budget together.For example, what is called backloading or a look-back provision; in other words, you do not really make the savings until 3, 4, 5, 6 years from now when you have already gone through a presidential election, when you are going to go through two, possible three, congressional elections, when you cannot quite be sure what the economic stability or instability of the country might be.Mr. Speaker, I noticed my good friend from American Samoa is here. I noticed that you had called his name previously, and he is only able to arrive right now.Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from American Samoa.",

    "text": "I thank you very much.That bit of Socratic dialog, Mr. Speaker, I think has stated the essence of it.Now, obviously any of our colleagues who were tuned in can say, well this is just a partisan observation or series of partisan observations by myself and the gentleman from Samoa, and that is OK. It does not bother me any it would be seen as partisan.The problem is, is it fair, is it accurate, is it factual? I will not say truthful. Truthful is always a matter of debate. What the truth is, is a matter of debate.I do think that people nonetheless come to conclusions. They nonetheless reserve judgment, if they are prudent, and when they think that they have heard the facts and contemplated the factual basis for a judgment, they then make it.Now let us take somebody outside the political system itself, the electoral system, and see what they have to say about it. I am referring now to Jodie Allen. I do not know Jodie Allen, if he is male or female. I have not met Mr. or Ms. Allen. All I know is Jodie Allen is editor of the Outlook section of the Washington Post where columnists are found of a Sunday.I do not blame Jodie Allen one way or another for the headlines. I think, Mr. Speaker, you and I are sufficiently well versed in dealing with newspapers as elected officials to know that the person who writes the story does not necessarily write the headline, and the headline does not necessarily refer to what is in the story, and you can find yourself reeling from what it says, but these headlines over the Allen columns say, ``Who won the budget battle?'' The sub headline is: ``Clinton's phony plan beats the GOP's phony plan.'' So I would guess that Jodie Allen has not got too much good to say about either. I will not say either of us, Mr. Speaker, but about either of these plans.But the whole point of the headline, I think, is to try and summarize the position of the Allen editorial which nonetheless contains some very interesting material which I would like to quote very briefly in what will be a series of remarks from me in time to come with respect to the budget and its realities as well as the debt limit and its connection to the budget.Just the opening commentary, and I am quoting now from Jodie Allen's editorial of January 28 in the Washington Post Outlook section, ``To hear the President tell it in his masterfully ingratiating State of the Union message last week, the country came very close to solving its Federal budget problem once and for all.''Quoting further then the President within the column, ```There is now broad bipartisan agreement that permanent deficit spending must come to an end,' said President Clinton last Tuesday evening,''' again quoting, ```though differences remain among us which are significant.' He also noted, `The combined total of the proposed savings that are in common to both, that is to say, the White House and the congressional Republican plans, is more than enough using numbers from your Congressional Budget Office to balance the budget in 7 years and provide a modest tax cut. These cuts are real.' '' Jodie Allen then goes on to say, ``Are they? It is a question worth asking as the country, having clearly decided the President got the best of Congress in the blame affixing event tries to decide whether it should now care that the overall competition has been called on account of political rain. In fact, the details of the competing proposals suggest that at least as far as the cause of fiscal solvency is concerned, less has been lost than either side would care to admit. No doubt some elements in both plans are real enough. Both sides, for example, were and apparently still are, determined to give out a pre-election tax cut, deficit be damned. It is also a pretty safe bet the agreements Congress extracts from the President in return for allowing the Government to keep running and borrowing more money will make substantial cuts in the immediate operating budgets of the many Federal agencies. Beyond that,'' and I think this is the important point here, I say parenthetically, ``Beyond that, things get a lot less real. For example, even had the White House embraced the GOP's harshest cuts, the deficit would still be upwards of $150 billion this fiscal year and still higher in 1997. By the end of the century, it might or might not dip below $100 billion. After that further progress against the deficit would likely be arrested and ultimately reversed under either plan'' from the Jodie Allen column.Mr. Speaker, that has been the essence of the observations that I have made from this podium again and again during this whole budget process. I have maintained from this podium, while all of the broader discussion is going on, about the balanced budget and all the posturing was taking place and all the puffed up rhetoric was being stated on this floor and in press conferences and covered by television cameras and radio microphones with breathless anticipation, nobody wanted to talk about the fact that regardless of what kind of balanced budget proposal was coming forward, it was actually increasing the deficit.I will state without equivocation again: No one can come to this floor, at least no one has to this point, despite my invitations again and again and again, to refute the position that I am maintaining that there has not been a balanced budget proposal put forward by anybody of either party that will stand the scrutiny of an honest appraisal as to whether or not it is increasing the deficit.It might be possible, Mr. Speaker, to achieve a balanced budget at some The question is, are you able to pay? Can you acquire debt in such a way and such a manner and for such a length of time that enables those or that institution doing the lending to be reasonably sure you are going to be able to make the payment, be able to sustain the debt, and sustain your life and its requirements monetarily.That is all this is about. I do not think that can be done in 7 years, but I am in the minority. I have been in legislative life in a State legislature, in the house of representatives at the State level and the State senate, in a city council, and in the Congress of the United States. I have been part of the board of directors of nonprofit organizations in many venues, Mr. Speaker. In other words, just about every community and electoral venue there is, I have participated in a legislative function where you had to deal with budgets, where you had to deal with coming to grips in most of those instances with balancing the budget.I have participated both as the chairman of an authorizing committee and as a member of an appropriations committee in balancing budgets in every legislative venue. So this is not something strange and new to me. I have better than two decades of experience in this area. So I am quite willing to come to grips with the idea that I am in the minority on this floor with the question of the number of years that should be reasonably made available to deal with the balanced budget.But I am not required, Mr. Speaker, simply because I am in the minority at the moment with respect to the numbers of years that would be required to do this, I am not required in that context to keep quiet about the fact that those who are putting forward a proposal that they can balance in 7 years cannot do it, and that to delude the American people, deliberately or otherwise, I am not trying to at this juncture cast some sort of aspersions on those who say they want to attempt it at least. All well and good, if that is what the proposition is.If someone wants to come to the floor and say no, I do not think it can be done, or on paper it cannot be done in 7 years if we are being honest about it, and the word ``honesty'' has been used over and over and over again on this floor, we want honest numbers. If that is the case, fine. You want to make an attempt over 7 years to do it, possibly it could be done. I think it would entail the kind of cuts that would cause incredible pain to people in all kinds of areas.Part of the pain that would come would come after 2002, after the 7-year period, when I am maintaining, and I think the burden of the rest of the article by Jodie Allen is that once you pass 2002, to the degree that you are able to achieve anywhere near the kind of goal that has been set in 1996 over that period of time, that 7-year period of time, there will be an explosion of debt, an explosion of indebtedness, an explosion of deficit spending.One of the categories that would, I think, harm us the most would be in Social Security. The Allen article, again I am citing it because I wanted this to be an outside person. It justifies not Neil Abercrombie by standing up here and tossing out facts and figures as suit me and then could be dismissed as a result of simply being partisan, no matter how accurate it might be. I am citing these columns, and I am glad to see the Jodie Allens and some of the other people I am going to be citing are beginning to pick this commentary up. I will be going over that in greater detail in time to come.Mr. Speaker, I believe my half hour is almost up. Let me conclude simply by saying that it is not a question of who wins the budget battle, it is a question of who loses. If the American people lose the budget battle, believe me, we all lose here politically. I hope in days to come to be able to shed a little more light on not only what the process is to this point, but what we can do about it in a practical way to bring a successful conclusion to this budget confrontation.",

    "text": "I thank the Chair.I wish to address that quite directly, Mr. Speaker, because I believe that the issue under consideration as embodied in the privileged resolution most certainly is in order to be discussed, should we pass this privileged resolution, and the decision as to whether or not we should pass the privileged resolution and whether or not we should pass the privileged resolution and whether it is properly before us is yours to make.I would like to argue, Mr. Speaker, as follows: That in the House rules and manual which the Parliamentarian has been kind enough to provide to me, there are numerous citations in here with respect to precedents as to the question of personal privilege, questions of privilege, in the absence of a quorum, et cetera.But fundamentally and elementally what is before the Chair is as follows: The question of privilege shall be first those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, integrity of its proceedings.I do not think that is necessarily at issue here. Probably a rather abstract argument or intellectual argument could be made it is.But I rest my case to the Chair on the second part, those affecting the rights, reputation, and conduct of Members individually in their representative capacity only.Mr. Speaker, we have in the Pacific, aside from the representation with the capacity to vote on this floor existing in Hawaii, Members from Guam and American Samoa. In addition, we have certain jurisdiction over island groupings in the Pacific under the Department of the Interior.Mr. Speaker, I maintain to the Chair and to the Members that the rights and reputation and conduct of Members individually in their representative capacity is seriously impaired if they cannot succeed in being able to make an argument to the floor Members assembled as to whether or not Mr. Chirac should be able to appear.I do believe it is well within the boundaries, because those Members cannot vote on this floor. Their representative capacity is solely on the basis of being able to persuade us on behalf of the peoples of the Pacific that there are matters which require our attention. This privileged resolution is directed exactly at that issue. Questions about radioactivity, and so forth, would be discussed under that privileged resolution as to why an affirmative vote is sought.So, Mr. Speaker, I most sincerely request your favorable ruling with respect to the question of privilege, and ask that it be allowed to be voted on, because this is the only way that the peoples of the Pacific, through their representatives, particularly from Guam and American Samoa, who do not have the right to vote on this floor, will be able to make a representation that they are otherwise obligated and required to do so by virtue of their presence here on the floor.It is clear, it seems to me, given the massive implications of radioactive leakage in the Pacific with the numerous explosions that have taken place in these tests, that other than through this representation through the privileged motion, the desirability or undesirability of having Mr. Chirac speak will not be able to be adequately addressed, and it seems to me a very powerful argument can be made for that, should we be allowed to proceed.",

If I could have or someone else could have come to this floor and made such a representation as you indicate, I will accept that.However, the rules also allow us to bring a privileged resolution to the floor at any time with the proper notice and to have it considered. One of the reasons or the principal reason that the Chair stated for turning down this privileged resolution offered by the gentlewoman from Hawaii [Mrs. Mink] is that it was not presented on January 26. From what the Chair just told me, it does not matter that it was not presented on January 26. It could have been presented on January 26, but it was not imperative that it be presented on January 26. So if that is the only reason, why can it not be presented today?",

    "title": "BUDGET MATTERS",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, in light of Ms. Norton's just-delivered remarks, I would like to say as someone coming from the last State to be admitted to the Union, the State of Hawaii, that I recognize only too fully what the implications are when you find yourself without representation, when you find yourself having to look to the good will of others.In this particular instance, Mr. Speaker, I think that we need to pay some final attention before we leave the building, before we leave the floor, and pay some particular attention to the proposition, is this actually what we should be doing?I do not mean tonight, Mr. Speaker. I think that the majority party, the Republican Party, and the House, have the opportunity to reconsider in the next day or two whether we want to go home, whether we need to go home bearing the burden of not having resolved the question of the debt limit.Now, we have had arguments made, we can show headlines and present charts indicating that there was ostensibly a breakdown in the budget negotiations. The budget negotiations, I submit, Mr. Speaker, are separate and apart from those negotiations that might occur or should be occurring with respect to the extension of the debt limit.In that regard, Mr. Speaker, I do not think they should be connected.I have listened with care. I have listened with intensity today to the arguments being made. As you know, earlier today, in the absence of immediate legislative business, there was quite an extensive discussion of some hours' length on the floor by various Members with respect to the question of debt limitation, balancing of the budget, and the implications for tax credits or tax cuts.Mr. Speaker, you may recall that I finished a special order just the other day, if you will, paraphrasing the title of an editorial to which I was referring in the Washington Post, the title being ``Who won the budget battle?'' I finished by saying the real question, Mr. Speaker, was who might lose in the budget battle? That is what really counts.We do not want anybody to lose in that budget battle, because we are talking about not only the future, which has been brought up many times by speakers on both sides of the aisle, children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, who will pay, but, rather, what will be lost in terms of what has been referred to over and over again as the full faith and credit of the United States with respect to paying its debts.Mr. Speaker, I submit there are two separate issues here that you and I, either individually, as Members of this body, or as representatives of positions in both caucuses can have, of fruitful discussion on this floor and in the context of the House of Representatives, institutionally speaking, as to what the best course of action is or should be with respect either to the budget or the debt limit.But to argue or make the debt limit extension part of that discussion at the present time I think advances no one's agenda, Mr. Speaker. Not mine. I do not come down to the floor to try and make a political game, rhetorically or otherwise, over arguing this issue. It is much too important, bigger than you or I.So I would hope that there would be consideration in the Republican Conference in the hours and immediate days to come, or, if we do leave without resolving the issue, that there would be a consideration that at least as far as the debt limit is concerned, that for now we set that aside as not being relevant to resolving the very real differences that may be between us politically or otherwise in terms of policy, and that we put the health and welfare literally of the Nation ahead of or at the top of all our priority lists, of all political parties concerned; that we separate that out, and that we have a full and fair discussion, not about the credit standing of the United States, but what kind of credit we can bring to ourselves as Members of this body, and what kind of credibility we can bring to the arguments that we are able to make about the budget: How we balance it, what we do about that, what we do about tax credits, what we do about whether or not there should be tax cuts; and that we argue this thing in a manner and in a context that establishes for the people of the United States, our colleagues, and those who may be viewing or observing our deliberations, that we do it in such a manner and in a context that reflects well not just on us, but on the seriousness of the issues at hand.With that, Mr. Speaker, I close by reiterating my plea that we do not utilize the debt limit extension as one of the fundamental blocks in the building of whatever political stance we may take with respect to balancing the budget or any other aspect of the political discussion that has been under way in these last days.",

    "title": "AGRICULTURAL MARKET TRANSITION ACT",
    "text": "Mr. Chairman, we have heard a discussion tonight about jobs, and I would say from my observation of the Republican primaries that I expect that Mr. Buchanan and others that are concerned about jobs in this country are going to be watching the result of this debate, because when you talk about cheap sugar you are talking about slave labor. You are talking about exporting jobs of Americans overseas. Make no mistake about it, a yes vote on this is going to be interpreted as being against the American worker, because when you go overseas to get that cheap sugar you are where there are no labor standards. There are no health standards. There are no environmental standards. There are no safety standards.We fought a war in this country to end slavery, and yet we are telling ourselves that in order to have cheaper sugar we are going to import slave labor sugar from people around the world who are being devoured by oligarchs, sugar oligarchs who have made it their business to destroy their people. They will destroy this country.Do the Members think that refineries are going to exist in this country when cheap sugar that is harvested by slave labor can go into a refinery in that country? That is what is going to happen. This is about jobs in this country. Urban Members of both sides of the aisle say that they are going to find cheaper sugar products in this country. Not only is that not true, but it is undercutting the people who are the best producers of sugar in the world. This is a jobs program. Vote for American workers. Vote down this amendment.Mr. Chairman, let me say first and foremost, if I had my way we would leave the no-cost sugar program alone. However, people asked for reform. The end product we have in the H.R. 2854, the Agricultural Market Transition Act, is reform. Domestic marketing allotments are eliminated. The loan rate will effectively be reduced. The marketing assessment paid by growers for deficit reduction purposes is increased 25 percent. The foreign sugar import level is raised by 20 percent. Yet, the no-cost provision which has been in effect since 1985 is still maintained. So if reform is what you want, reform is what you got.Mr. Chairman, for over 150 years, sugar has been grown in the State of Hawaii. Sugar has played a major role in the historical, cultural, and economic development of Hawaii. However, the survival of sugar is now in question. Over the past decade, sugar production in Hawaii has dropped drastically. In 1986, over 1 million tons of sugar was produced. In 1995, the amount will be approximately 492,000 tons.If Hawaii sugar producers were inefficient or unproductive I could not support the sugar program. Yet, the data proves that the Hawaii yields of sugar are among the highest in the world, about 10.5 tons an acre in 1993. In addition, Hawaii's sugar field workers have the highest standard of living of any agricultural workers in the world. The only way the world sugar market competes with our domestic sugar industry is to artificially subsidize their sugar industry and to utilize slave labor. Foreign competitors do not have to comply with Federal and State standards for worker safety, wage and healthcare benefits, and for environmental protection. The concept of free trade is splendid, but for sugar it is a fantasy. One on one on a level playing field Hawaii sugar producers can beat anyone.In fact, according to a 1994 Landell Mills Commodities Studies the evidence reveals the United States to be the second lowest cost among the world's 31 major beet-producing countries, and 29th among 62 cane producing countries. Among the world's 13 producers of corn sweetener, the United States ranks as the absolute lowest cost.This Nation's highly efficient sugar farmers are ready, willing, and able to compete against foreign farmers. Until a level playing field exists, however, it would be a mistake to dismantle a successful sugar policy while other nations continue their market-distorting habits at America's expense.Mr. Chairman, during the debate someone may bring up the Sweetener Users' Association, which represents the big, multinational food, candy and soda corporations, poster child--Bob's Candy of Albany, GA. As they go on to say, if sugar weren't so costly in the United States, they could stay competitive and not be forced to move jobs overseas. It is the sugar, says Bob's Candy. It costs too much here in America. Bob's Candy is forced to move operations to Jamaica because sugar is cheaper there.Well, my colleagues, let me tell you the rest of the story.Could it be there are other factors that brought Bob's Candy to Jamaica? Like, maybe the fact that Bob doesn't have to pay his Jamaican employees anything near what he's paying his Georgia employees? Or perhaps, because there's no NLRB, no OSHA, no EPA, no Medicare payroll taxes to contend with in Jamaica? Could any of these factors have played a role in Bob's decision to locate in Jamaica--or was it just the price of sugar, as big sweetener users say.Incidentally, according to Dunn &amp; Bradstreet, Bob's Candy is in the top 25 percent in terms of profitability of all American candy makers.Bob's Candy is simply a case of a profitable candy maker trying to use the sugar program as a convenient scapegoat for its decision to Well, I don't buy it--and neither should the American public.Mr. Chairman and my House colleagues, support good policy, support American jobs, support the American economy. Vote against the Miller-Schumer amendment: immediate disaster, disguised as transition.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, article I, section 2 of the Constitution requires the House of Representatives to choose a Speaker. It is customary at the commencement of every Congress for members of each party to vote for the candidate decided upon by his or her caucus. Because governance of the House conforms to the democratic principles which undergird our Republic, there is no doubt that the votes of the majority will determine who shall be our Speaker.Today, however, we are choosing a presiding officer in unprecedented circumstances. Never before has there been an election for Speaker in which one of the candidates stands formally accused by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct of violating the rules of the House. It is not my intention today to argue the merits of the charges against the gentleman from Georgia or what if any sanctions should be imposed. I focus instead on the implications of the committee's statement of alleged violation for today's election for Speaker, for the Speakership as an institution, for the House of Representatives, and for our Nation itself.The facts are these: The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct alleges that the gentleman from Georgia violated the rules of the House. As of this date the committee has not completed its consideration of the case, and no resolution has been achieved. When resolution does occur, it may very well involve sanctions which make the gentleman from Georgia ineligible to hold the post of Speaker.Removal of a Speaker under those conditions would be debilitating for the House and the Nation. It would cause chaos within the House and further undermine public confidence in democratic institutions. Even if resolution of the case against the gentleman from Georgia does not result in his ineligibility for the Speakership, his election as Speaker at this time would be inadvisable for two reasons: No. 1, the time, attention, and energy he must devote to his case will diminish the personal resources available for the discharge of his duties as Speaker of the House; and No. 2, the shadow of doubt and suspicion cast by the proceedings against him will undoubtedly fall on every action of the House and bring into question the integrity of this institution.I believe, therefore, that until the case against the gentleman from Georgia is resolved, the House should choose an interim Speaker. I reiterate my acknowledgement that the majority has the right to determine who that individual shall be. However, in order to ensure that the business of the House is conducted in an undistracted manner, free of doubts about the integrity of the institution and its governance, that person should be someone not involved in the ethical issues in which the gentleman from Georgia finds himself enmeshed.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Library of Congress, the Bishop Museum Film Archives, and other institutions, organizations, and individuals who are working to preserve the rich film heritage of this great Nation. The Library of Congress is host to the National Film Preservation Board which advises the Librarian of Congress on selections to the National Film Registry and on national film preservation policy. Through the generosity of the James Madison Council and support from leading directors committed to film preservation, the Library of Congress is sponsoring its second season of the National Film Registry tour. The tour showcases 26 feature films and 10 short subjects from the National Film Registry in their original 35 millimeter or 16 millimeter formats. The American public can enjoy a unique opportunity to sample films from the Library's collections. During its first season, the tour hosted public screenings of a broad variety of classic American films in eight cities across the country.Each year, the board, members of the public, and the Librarian of Congress select up to 25 films for inclusion on the Registry. The films chosen are not necessarily the best American films ever made nor the most famous. Under the terms of the National Film Preservation Act, films selected for the Registry are those that continue to have enduring cultural, historical, or aesthetic significance.Created in 1988, the National Film Preservation Board recognizes the vital contribution of film to the American heritage. The perilous state of America's film heritage was documented by the Library and the National Film Preservation Board in ``Film Preservation 1993: A Study of the Current State of American Film Preservation.'' More than half of all American films made before 1951 are lost forever. Film is a fragile medium, and motion pictures, both old and new, face deterioration problems. Only by storing films in low-temperature and low-humidity environments can the decay process be slowed. The majority of American films do not receive this care and are in critical need of preservation.The National Film Registry Tour pays tribute to American filmmaking and promotes public awareness of the need to protect and preserve America's film heritage. As Dr. Billington notes, ``The moving picture is not so much the art form as the language of our time. Motion pictures provide an unparalleled record of American life and culture. If we can preserve these films, researchers will have the sights and sounds that flesh out the written record of great events and everyday life.'' Of special significance when the tour stopped in Honolulu earlier this month was the screening of Hawaiian regional films including ``This is America'' (1947), which urges support of Hawaii statehood. One highlight of this event was the Library's donation of a new 16 millimeter print of a pre-1915 film shot in Hawaii (featuring substantial footage shot by the Thomas Edison Company in 1906) to the Bishop Museum Archives.I urge my colleagues to join me in applauding the efforts of the Library of Congress, the Bishop Museum Film Archives, the International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House, the Museum of Modern Art Department of Film and Video, the UCLA Film and Television Archive, and all others involved in this important work.",

    "title": "GRANTING CONSENT TO CERTAIN AMENDMENTS ENACTED BY THE HAWAII LEGISLATURE TO HAWAIIAN HOMES COMMISSION ACT OF 1920",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for offering me the opportunity to explain this resolution.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my joint resolution, House Joint Resolution 32, to consent to certain amendments by the legislature of the State of Hawaii to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920.Over 75 years have elapsed since Congress passed the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920. Under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, approximately 203,500 acres of public lands was set aside for the rehabilitation of native Hawaiians through a Government-sponsored homesteading project.Two major factors prompted Congress to pass this act. First, native Hawaiians were a dying race. Population data showed that the number of full-blooded Hawaiians in the territory, the then-territory of Hawaii, had decreased from an 1826 estimate of 142,650 to 22,600 in 1919.Second, Congress saw that previous systems of land distribution were ineffective when judged practically by the benefits accruing to native Hawaiians. The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act was originally intended for rural homesteading; that is, for native Hawaiians to leave urban areas and return to lands to become subsistence or commercial farmers and ranchers.Yet the demand of native Hawaiians for residential house lots has far exceeded the demand for agricultural or pastoral lots.The Hawaii Statehood Act of 1959 shifted the responsibility for the administration of the Hawaii Homes Commission Act from the Territory to the State of Hawaii. In accordance with the Statehood Act, title to the available lands was transferred to the new State. The Statehood Act, however, also included certain requirements regarding the State of Hawaii's administration of the Hawaii homes program, and it is these that give rise to joint resolution.Section 4 of the Hawaii Statehood Act provides that, and I quote, ``the consent of the United States,'' unquote, would be required for certain amendments by the State to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act. As part of the administrative responsibility the Department of the Interior undertook in 1983 as, quote, ``lead Federal agency,'' unquote, for purposes of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, the department and the Governor of Hawaii informally agreed in 1987 to a procedure under which the department would become involved in securing consent to State amendments to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act. Congress has previously enacted two statutes consenting to various amendments to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act by the State of Hawaii: Public Laws 99-577 and 100-398.Generally, it has been the position of the Department of the Interior in connection with State amendments to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act to refrain from second-guessing the Hawaii State Legislature and Governor of Hawaii with respect to merits of the amendments.The following two amendments have been determined to require the consent of the United States and again by extension therefore are meeting on the floor today on this resolution:One of them is Act 339 of the Session Laws of Hawaii, 1993. This statute establishes the Hawaiian Hurricane Relief Fund. Section 7 authorized the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands to obtain homeowner's insurance coverage for lessees and to issue revenue bonds. Section 15 of the bill consists of a severability clause which provides that consent requirement, if any, that applies to the Hawaiian Home Lands provisions of the act shall not be deemed to have the validity of the other provisions of the act. The Department of the Interior has taken the position that State enactments which include a severability clause, in the exercise of caution, be submitted to Congress for approval.The second measure, Mr. Speaker, is Act 37 of the Session Laws of 1994. This statute allows homestead lessees to designate as a successor to the lease a grandchild who is at least 25 percent native Hawaiian. Under the current law, as adopted by Hawaii in 1982, a lessee may designate his or her spouse or children as a successor under the lease if they are 25 percent native Hawaiian. The bill would thus allow a similar designation with respect to grandchildren. The Department of the Interior concurs with the State's position that congressional consent is required for this legislation in that it amends the 50-percent blood quantum requirement included in the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act.So in summary, Mr. Speaker, these two measures involve the establishment of Hawaiian Hurricane Act, obviously we are subject to such phenomenon, natural phenomena in the Hawaiian Islands, and it is necessary for us to establish that fund. And by extension, for the reasons mentioned, to request the United States, that is, the House of Representatives and the Senate, to concur. And second, to provide an opportunity because of the passage of time for lessees to designate their grandchildren as well as their spouse or children if they meet the 25 percent native Hawaiian requirement.For these reasons and with respect to that history and legacy of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support these worthwhile measures.",

We need to keep in mind that the act was passed originally in 1920 and that native Hawaiians themselves are coming to grips with this question, and we hope for a resolution that may find its way for presentation to this body in the near future.With that, Mr. Speaker, I request a favorable attention of the Members of the House to this resolution and I hope that it will receive the necessary votes in order to pass. The people of Hawaii will be very grateful for that outcome, and native Hawaiians in particular will be the beneficiaries.Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for his remarks and his insight.

I commend him for his efforts to draw attention to the significance of the Asia-Pacific region.This resolution highlights the unique and important relationship between the United States and Japan. It also addresses the important role that the people of Okinawa have played in ensuring peace and stability in the region.The significance of the Asia-Pacific region will continue to grow in the 21st century. As we continue to review the defense treaty between the United States and Japan, it is important that the people of Japan know that we are committed to the long-term stability of the region. The United States-Japan relationship remains the cornerstone of our engagement in the region.As a nation, we must continue to strengthen our ties with Japan. In Hawaii, the stability of our economy is tied to the stability of the region and largely to Japan. The people of Hawaii have developed broadbased ties with Japan, to include a strong relationship with the Prefecture of Okinawa.As a result of these ties, the people of Hawaii continue to be concerned about the land issues being addressed in Okinawa with regard to basing of United States military forces. Unfortunately, it took the rape of a 12-year-old school girl in 1995 to turn the attention of the world toward the issues raised in Okinawa with respect to their land use concerns. Today, we are making steady progress on these very sensitive issues which need to be resolved between the Okinawa Prefecture and the Government of Japan.It is no exaggeration to say that Okinawa's people view their homeland as occupied territory. They see the overwhelming presence of United States military forces there as confirmation and they remain the poorest prefecture in Japan.Some 50 years after the end of World War II in the Pacific, Okinawa is the only unresolved residual issue of any significance between Japan and the United States. The people of Okinawa are the least culpable of all those thrust into World War II. For centuries past, they have been known in the region for promoting peace. They are friendly to the interests and people of the United States. Yet they bear the most burden generations later.They have given up a great deal in terms of economic prosperity and deserve to be recognized for their contributions toward ensuring the treaty's implementation and regional peace and security.",

I do not know if we are ever going to achieve that position again.We may want to pause for a moment of silence at this point, reverence for the question of bipartisanship. It surely can take place and it does take place over the African elephant. I think we could probably extend that to the donkey and the elephant in the United States, but I am not sure about the former as opposed to the latter.In any event, Mr. Speaker, it is the African Elephant Conservation Reauthorization Act, and it is literally deadly serious business we are about on this floor today.I support the African Elephant Conservation Act and its purpose in perpetuating healthy populations of African elephants. I am concerned that other U.S. funded programs that may impact the African elephant may not be working towards this purpose as expressed by the act. I hope that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the United States Agency for International Development will work cooperatively towards the ends of African elephant conservation.I appreciate the importance of the Speaker, the chairman and the subcommittee chair, the importance which the Speaker and the chairman and the subcommittee chair place on conserving African elephants, and I most certainly commend them for moving expeditiously to reauthorize the African Elephant Conservation Act.I would hope, Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, especially that the young people of this country would pay particular attention, given the fact that we have before us the situation with the panda at the Washington Zoo now undergoing an operation with species throughout the United States and the rest of the world in zoos finding themselves under extreme stress and duress. With populations of animals such as the elephant experiencing similar calamities and difficulties throughout the world, I think that it is incumbent upon us to help other nations and other people find ways to have conservation and preservation efforts be made manifest in more than just the abstract.We do not want to find ourselves reduced to finding reruns of National Geographic specials or Discovery Channel programs constituting or, for that matter, observing animal acts in Las Vegas as the sole preservation effort that is made by this species with regard to the rest of the species on the planet.This particular act, this reauthorization act, is a serious effort made on a bipartisan basis by serious minded Members who want to see to it that we set a standard; with this act we are doing it. If we can take similar measures with other species throughout the world, I look forward to the time when we can say with some confidence that we have made moves and taken steps to see to it that conservation is more than just a word.I commend the gentleman from New Jersey, [Mr. Saxton], for bringing this bill forward and am very grateful for the cooperation that he and the staff of the committee have extended on this bill and for all the Members who have expressed support.",

    "title": "JUVENILE CRIME CONTROL ACT OF 1997",
    "text": "Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of H.R. 3, the Juvenile Crime Control Act of 1997. This highly focused bill deals with violent juvenile offenders on the Federal level. H.R. 3 addresses the issue of incarcerating violent juvenile offenders at the Federal level by lowering the age at which a judge may waive a violent juvenile offender into adult court; treats juvenile records the same as adult records; and increases accountability for juveniles adjudicated delinquent and their parents. The measure also encourages placing juveniles younger than 16 in suitable juvenile facility prior to disposition or sentencing. For juveniles 16 and older, it provides for their detention in a suitable place designated by the Attorney General. This by no means requires that juvenile offenders on the Federal level be housed with adults. In addition, H.R. 3 provides that every juvenile detained prior to disposition or sentencing shall be provided with reasonable safety and security.H.R. 3 provides incentives for States to emulate this new approach. The grant program in H.R. 3 would be authorized at $500 million for 3 years. States must meet certain requirements if they are to obtain money from grants authorized by H.R. 3--e.g., they must try violent juvenile felons as young as 15 as adults; they must treat juvenile records like adult records; and they must permit parent-accountability orders. States which meet all the criteria could use the money for various initiatives such as establishing and maintaining accountability-based programs that work with juvenile offenders who are referred by law enforcement agencies, or which are designed in cooperation with law enforcement officials, to protect students and school personnel from drugs, gangs, and youth violence.Although I support H.R. 3, I realize it does not address the issue of nonviolent offenders on the State and Federal level, nor does it provide prevention and rehabilitation programs for juvenile offenders. These issues should be addressed when Congress reauthorizes the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. That is the appropriate time and the correct venue to aid our communities in developing programs to help youth stay away from crime, gangs, drugs and guns. Juvenile justice officials in Hawaii have asked for help in funding prevention programs, substance abuse programs, support programs for children who have little or no family life, and programs that would give State court judges an alternative program to deal with certain juvenile offenders instead of sending them to correctional facilities. I am sure my colleagues have heard similar requests from juvenile justice officials in their districts.Sending children to jail and throwing away the key while ignoring prevention and rehabilitation programs will not effectively reduce juvenile crime or be cost-effective. A 1996 study by the RAND Corp. found that early intervention and prevention programs are, indeed, cost-effective solutions for reducing the juvenile crime rate. The study indicates that prevention programs which focus on early intervention in the lives of children who are at greatest risk of eventual delinquent behavior are effective in reducing arrest and rearrest rates.We need to send a message to juveniles: If you commit a violent offense you will be punished accordingly. However, at the same time we must continue our attempt to reach kids, to get them involved in their communities, and to prevent them from taking part in dangerous activities in the first place. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3 and to strongly support a debate occurring this year on reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974.",

    "title": "DEDICATION OF ETERNITY HALL",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is a matter of some coincidence that today is Humanities on the Hill Day, and we had an opportunity, many of us, to meet with the representatives of the Endowment for the Humanities in our local jurisdictions from all over the country.In that context, I had the privilege of addressing the group who came here this morning for a few minutes, and had a chance to comment to them about a recent event in Hawaii at Schofield Barracks where I had the opportunity to deliver remarks at the dedication of Eternity Hall, Eternity Hall in Quadrangle D at Schofield Barracks. That occasion was on April 2, 1997.Tomorrow, Mr. Speaker, marks the 20th anniversary of the death of James Jones, the author of ``From Here to Eternity.'' I would like to take this opportunity, then, today to deliver yet again the comments that were made on that occasion, to indicate to my colleagues that tomorrow the film ``From Here to Eternity'' will be shown at Schofield Barracks, because the young soldiers that are there have taken a renewed interest in their history, have taken a renewed interest in Schofield Barracks and in World War II and, by extension, the author who made it possible for us to understand more about ourselves as a result of the great art that is ``From Here to Eternity.''Mr. Speaker, ``From Here to Eternity,'' like all great works of art, transcends its form. In this instance, the novel. Like all great works of art, it transforms those who experience it, its readers. It transposes its content, the characters and their actions, into a larger vision of life itself, a dimension of depth beyond the story itself.Schofield Barracks is the stage upon which the story unfolds. But it is not events of which we learn. Rather, we learn the meaning of integrity, honesty, honor, and above all, what it takes to be human. This is what it meant to me. ``From Here to Eternity'' shaped the basic values I hold to this day.So it was with a sense of outrage that I read a sneering, wounding article about James Jones just before leaving for Europe in 1967 on a backpack trek around the world. I had no idea I would literally walk into him in Paris some weeks later.I knew it was him the moment I saw this short, square block of a man plowing down the avenue. In my mind's eye now I see a cigar clamped in his clenched jaw, but perhaps it is only because I like to believe it was there. All I really saw were his eyes. How could such gentle eyes be locked into such a rugged mug of a face?To his friend William Styron, and I quote, ``was there ever such a face, with its Beethovenesque brow and lantern jaw and stepped-upon-looking nose. A forbidding face until one realized that it only seemed to glower, since the eyes really projected a skeptical humor that softened the initial impression of rage.''On impulse, I spoke to him.``Don't pay any attention to the critics. You write for us, for me. We're the readers. Pruitt, Warden, Maggio, they're real for us. ``From Here to Eternity'' means everything for us. What you write is important to us. To hell with the critics. Keep writing for us.'' Or some such blither.I felt a total fool. He stared at me, and I bolted away. A few days later I found myself outside his home on the Ile St. Louis behind Notre Dame. The San Francisco Diggers who fed the homeless during those years had published a directory of Americans worldwide who could be counted on to be kind to American travelers in need. I had come upon it in a Left Bank book store, and Jones's name and address were in it.I rang the bell on impulse out of both a desire to apologize and yet tell him again more clearly how much he meant to us as readers. A suspicious housekeeper somehow agreed to tell him that the man who stopped him on the Right Bank the other day wanted to see him.Amazingly she returned animated. By all means Mr. Jones would see me. He was anxious to see me. Please come up. Would it be possible to wait a few minutes while he finished his writing for the day. Please don't leave.I was a bit dazed as I sat on a stool on what appeared to be a tiny bar and library area. Suddenly he burst through a door, barrel-chested, huge smile, moving like a pulling guard on a halfback sweep.``Am I glad to see you. I told Gloria,'' his wife Gloria, ``I told Gloria all about our meeting. I've been writing on the energy of it for the past two weeks. I never seem to meet readers any more. It's always somebody who wants something from me. How about a drink?''From that moment, I ceased to be a fan. I became a fierce partisan. I had never met anyone so nakedly honest in his observations and inquiries, so plain-spokenly straight. No rhetorical brilliance, just easy-fit words and thoughts expressed as solid and simple as a beating heart, just like From Here to Eternity.In 1951, the Los Angeles Times said:James Jones has written a tremendously compelling and compassionate story. The scope covers the full range of the human condition, man's fate and man's hope. It is a tribute to human dignity.The book was From Here to Eternity. Its author was 30 years old. In March of 1942, he had written to his brother Jeff from his bunk at Schofield Barracks.Sometimes the air is awfully clear here. You can look off to sea and see the soft, warm, raggedy roof of clouds stretching on and on and on. It almost seems as if you can look right on into eternity.It is 20 years tomorrow since James Jones died, leaving his work to speak for him and to us.Biographer George Garret said,Boy and man, Jones never lost his energetic interest, his continual curiosity, the freshness of his vision. It was these qualities, coupled with the rigor of his integrity, which defined the character of his life's work.Others, of course, recognize these qualities and wish to speak for and about James Jones on this anniversary of his passing.Winston Groom, George Hendrick, Norman Mailer, William Styron, whose Forward to To Reach Eternity: The letters of James Jones, I include here in its totality and from which I will read, Mr. Speaker, excerpts, and Willie Morris, friend and biographer of his last days, all are represented in the remarks which follow.First is a letter to me from Winston Groom:Dear Congressman Abercrombie: Gloria Jones asked me to write to you regarding the dedication of a building in Schofield Barracks in honor of her late husband, James Jones. This is a wonderful and fitting tribute to a fine soldier and a great writer who contributed perhaps more than any other to the public understanding of the military during the World War II era. Long before I wrote Forrest Gump I began a friendship with Jim Jones which was cut far too short by his untimely death. He was always kind and giving to the younger generation of writers and took time to help me with my first novel, Better Times Than These, which was about the Vietnam War. In fact, I dedicated that book to Jim. I congratulate you and all the others who worked to create this very appropriate memorial to a great American patriot and champion of the common soldier. Respectfully yours, Winston Groom.I received a letter from George Hendrick, a professor of English at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.Dear Neil: I'm sending along, as promised, the statement for the Schofield Barracks ceremony. I am certainly pleased to know about this important event and to play some small part in it. The university library has acquired the manuscript of From Here To Eternity and The Pistol, and they will be on exhibit at the next meeting of the James Jones Literary Society in Springfield on November 4 of this year. I hope you can attend.Professor Hendrick's comments are as follows:Pvt. James Jones, then a member of the air corps, transferred to the 27th Infantry Regiment at Schofield Barracks in September of 1940. Jones, not yet 19 years old, was already an aspiring novelist, and he was later to have a clear recollection of life in F Company in Quad D, of the lives of officers and enlisted men, and of the landscape around Schofield. In From Here to Eternity he made this peacetime army uniquely his own. When Jones was finishing Eternity in 1949 he wrote a chapter about the events of December 7, 1941, at Pearl Harbor, with emphasis on the strafing of Schofield Barracks that day. He wrote his editor about the chapter.And I quote:Here is the piece de resistance, the tour de force, the final accolade and calumnity, the climax, peak, and focus. Here, in a word, is Pearl Harbor . . . I personally believe it will stack up with Stendhal's Waterloo or Tolstoy's Austerlitz. That is what I was aiming at, and wanted it to do, and I think it does it. I don't think it does, send it back, and I'll rewrite it. Good isn't enough, not for me, any way; good is only middling fair. We must remember people will be reading this book a couple of hundred years after I'm dead . . . The chapter did not need rewriting. In fact, his intent throughout the novel had been to aim high and capture for all time the complex world of Schofield Barracks as it was in 1940 and 1941. From Here To Eternity is now a classic American novel, and Schofield Barracks is preserved in it as if in amber.Norman Mailer, along with William Styron and James Jones, the great trio of writers to come out of World War II said, and I quote:The only one of my contemporaries who I felt had more talent than myself was James Jones, and he has also been the one writer of my time for whom I felt any love. We saw each other only six or eight times over the years, but it always gave me a boost to know that Jim was in town. He carried his charge with him, he had the talent to turn a night of heavy drinking into a great time. I felt then and can still say now that From Here To Eternity has been the best American novel since of the Second World War, and if it is ridden with faults, and ignorances, and a smudge of the sentimental, it has the force that few novels one could name. What was unique about Jones was that he had come out of nowhere, self-taught, a clunk in his lacks, but the only one of us who had the guts of a broken-glass brawl.William Styron faxed to me his introduction to the volume of Jim Jones's letters. He asked that certain passages, those which he thought were most effective for illuminating James Jones, be read at the ceremony. He invited me to feel free to use any part of the essay, not just the circled passages, and I think that I have the essence of it here from William Styron:From Here To Eternity was published at a time when I was in the process of completing my own first novel. I remember reading Eternity when I was living and writing in a country house in Rockland County, not far from New York City, and as has so often been the case with books that have made a large impression on me, I can recall the actual reading, the mood, the excitement, the surroundings. I remember the couch I lay on while reading, the room, the wallpaper, white curtains stirring and flowing in an indolent breeze, and cars that passed on the road outside. I think that perhaps I read portions of the book in other parts of the house, but it is that couch what I chiefly recollect, and myself sprawled on it, holding the hefty volume aloft in front of my eyes as I remained more or less transfixed through most of the waking hours of several days enthralled, to the story's power, its immediate narrative authority, its vigorously peopled barracks and barrooms its gutsy humor and its immense harrowing sadness.The book was about the unknown world of the peace time army. Even if I had not suffered some of the outrages of military life, I am sure I would have recognized the book's stunning authenticity, its burly artistry, its sheer richness as life. A sense of permanence attached itself to the pages. This remarkable quality did not arise from Jones's language, for it was quickly apparent that the author was not a stylist, certainly not the stylist of refinement and nuance that former students of creative writing classes had been led to emulate.The genial rhythms and carefully wrought sentences that English majors had been encouraged to admire were not on display in Eternity, nor was the writing even vaguely experimental; it was so conventional as to be premodern. This was doubtless a blessing, for here was a writer whose urgent, blunt language with its off-key tonalities and hulking emphasis on adverbs wholly matched his subject matter. Jones's wretched outcasts and the narrative voice he had summoned to tell their tale had achieved a near-perfect synthesis. What also made the book a triumph were the characters Jones had fashioned--Prewitt, Warden, Maggio, the officers and their wives, the Honolulu whores, the brig rats, and all the rest. There were none of the wan, tentative effigies that had begun to populate the pages of postwar fiction during its brief span, but human beings of real size and arresting presence, believable and hard to forget. The language may have been coarse-grained but it had Dreiserian force, and the people were as alive as those of Dostoevski.It has been said that writers are fiercely jealous of one another. Kurt Vonnegut has observed that most writers display towards one another the edgy mistrust of bears. This may be true, but I do recall that in those years directly following World War II, there seemed to be a moratorium on envy, and most of the young writers who were heirs to the Lost Generation developed, for a time at least, a camaraderie, or a reasonable compatibility, as if there were glory enough to go all around for all the novelists about to try to fit themselves into the niches alongside those of the earlier masters.When I finished reading From Here to Eternity, I felt no jealousy at all, only a desire to meet this man just four years older than myself, who had inflicted on me such emotional turmoil in the act of telling me authentic truths about an underside of American life I barely knew existed. I wanted to talk to the writer who had dealt so eloquently with those lumpen warriors and who had created scenes that tore at the guts. Jim was serious about fiction in a way that now seems a little old-fashioned and ingenuous, with the novel for him in magisterial reign. He saw it as sacred mission, as icon, as Grail. Like so many American writers of distinction, Jim had not been granted the benison of a formal education, but like these dropouts he had done a vast amount of impassioned and eclectic reading; thus while there were gaps in his literary background that college boys like me had filled, he had absorbed an impressive amount of writing for a man whose schoolhouse had been at home or in a barracks. He had been, and still was, a hungry reader, and it was fascinating in those dawn sessions with him to hear this fellow built like a welterweight boxer, speak in his gravelly drill sergeant's voice about a few of his more recherche loves. Virginia Woolf was one, I recall; Edith Wharton another. I did not agree with Jim much of the time, but I usually found that his tastes and judgments were, on their own terms, gracefully discriminating and astute.Basically it had to do with men at war, for Jim had been to war, he had been wounded on Guadalcanal, had seen men die, had been sickened and traumatized by the experience. Hemmingway had been to war too, and had been wounded, but despite the gloss of misery and disenchantment that overlaid his work, Jim maintained he was at heart a war lover, a macho contriver of romantic effects, and to all but the gullible and wishful, the lie showed glaringly through the fabric of his books and in his life.He therefore had committed the artist's chief sin by betraying the truth. Jim's opinions of Hemingway, justifiable in its harshness or not, was less significant than what it revealed about his own view of existence, which at its most penetrating, as in From Here to Eternity and later in The Pistol and The Thin Red Line, was always seen through the soldier's eye, in a hallucination where the circumstances of military life cause men to behave mostly like beasts and where human dignity, while welcome and often redemptive, is not the general rule.Jones was among the best anatomists of warfare in our time, and in his bleak, extremely professional vision he continued to insist that war was a congenital and chronic illness from which we would never be fully delivered. War rarely ennobled men and usually degraded them. Cowardice and heroism were both celluloid figments, generally interchangeable, and such grandeur as could be salvaged from the mess lay at best in pathos, in the haplessness of men's mental and physical suffering.Living or dying in war had nothing to do with valor, it had to do with luck. Jim had endured very nearly the worst. He had seen death face to face. At least partially as a result of this, he was quite secure in his masculinity and better able than anyone else I have known to detect muscle-bound pretense and empty bravado. It is fortunate that he did not live to witness Rambo or our high-level infatuation with military violence. It would have brought out the assassin in him.The next major work of war was The Thin Red Line, a novel of major dimensions whose rigorous integrity and disciplined art allowed Jim once again to exploit the military world he knew so well. Telling the story of GIs in combat in the Pacific, it is squarely in the gritty, no-holds-barred tradition of American realism, a genre that even in 1962, when the book was published, would have seemed oafishly out of date had it not been for Jim's mastery of the narrative and his grasp of sun-baked milieu of bloody island warfare, which exerted such a compelling hold on the reader that he seemed to breathe new life into the form.Romain Gary had commented about the book: ``It is essentially a love poem about the human predicament and like all great books it leaves one with a feeling of wonder and hope.'' The rhapsodic note is really not all that overblown.Upon rereading, The Thin Red Line stands up remarkably well, one of the best novels written about American fighting men in combat. The Thin Red Line is a brilliant example of what happens when a novelist summons strength from the deepest wellsprings of his inspiration. In this book, along with From Here to Eternity and Whistle, a work of many powerful scenes that suffered from the fact that he was dying as he tried unsuccessfully to finish it, Jim obeyed his better instincts by attending to that forlorn figure whom in all the world he had cared for most and understood better than any other writer alive, the common foot soldier, the grungy enlisted man.His friend at the end, Willie Morris, wrote these words:Dear Congressman Abercrombie, I hope this is what you had in mind. My friend Jim Jones was sent to Schofield Barracks at the age of 18 in 1939 as a private in the old Hawaii Division, which later became the 25th Tropical Lightning Infantry Division. He was a member of Company F. It would be the division of the memorable characters in Jones's classic novel From Here to Eternity: Prewitt and Maggio and Warden and Chief Choate and Stark and Captain Dynamite Holmes and the others, and it would go through Guadalcanal and New Georgia and the liberation of the Philippines all the way to the occupation of mainland Japan, although Jim's own fighting days would end when he was wounded at Guadalcanal. Schofield Barracks resonates with the memory of James Jones and the imperishable characters and events he placed here in his fiction, the sounds of the drills, the echoes of Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt's Taps across the quadrangle, the Japanese planes swooping over the barracks of the fateful morning of December 7, 1941. On the morning of December 7, after the attack started, Jim went to the guard orderly desk outside the colonel's office of the old 27th Regiment quadrangle to carry messages for distraught officers, wearing an issue pistol he was later able to make off with as his fictional Private Mast did in The Pistol. In mid-afternoon of that day his company, along with hundreds of others, pulled out of Schofield for their defensive beach positions. As they passed Pearl Harbor, they could see the rising columns of smoke for miles around. Jones wrote: ``I shall never forget the sight as we passed over the lip of the central plateau and began the long drop down to Pearl City. Down toward the towering smoke columns as far as the eye could see, the long line of Army trucks would serpentine up and down the draws of red dirt through the green of cane and pineapple. Machine guns were mounted on the cab roofs of every truck possible. I remember thinking with the sense of the profoundest awe that none of our lives would ever be the same, that a social, even a cultural watershed had been crossed which we could never go back over, and I wondered how many of us would survive to see the end results. I wondered if I would. I had just turned 20 the month before.'' It is fitting that Eternity Hall be dedicated to James Jones. He was one of the greatest writers of World War II. Many consider him the foremost one. His spirits will dwell forever on these grounds.On my last night in Paris heading for Africa and beyond, I left Jim and Gloria vowing someday somehow would I see From Here to Eternity and Jim honored at Schofield Barracks.James Jones had said to his brother in 1942,I would like to leave books behind me to let people know what I have lived. I'd like to think that people would read them avidly, as I have read so many, and would feel the sadness and frustration and joy and love I tried to put in them, that people would think about that guy James Jones and wish they had known the guy that could write like that.They know you at Schofield Barracks, Jim, today, in Eternity Hall. The ghosts of all those who came before to this quadrangle and the shades of all those who will come, know you and they know you love them.As he neared death, he struggled to finish Whistle, to complete what he had begun with Eternity. The final scene of the novel became the ultimate expression of his passion. Facing the end, he wrote of ``taking into himself all the pain and anguish and sorrow and misery that is the lot of all soldiers, taking it into himself and into the universe as well.''The universe for James Jones in From Here to Eternity began and ended at Schofield Barracks. The measure of this universe and the final judgment of and about James Jones is to be found in the simple declaration of his dedication:To the United States Army. I have eaten your bread and salt. I have drunk your water and wine. The deaths ye died I have watched beside, and the lives ye led were mine. From Rudyard Kipling.``I write,'' Jim said, ``to reach eternity.'' You made it, Jim. Today in Eternity Hall, in Quadrangle D, in Schofield Barracks, you made it. Welcome home, Jim.",

The issue of bycatch should be addressed in this fishery and every other fishery with a strong bycatch reduction requirement. The gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Gilcrest], I am happy to say, was willing to accept the amendment. The gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] was willing to cooperate.However, word came down to the committee that the State Department was firmly opposed to any changes in the legislation. The State Department does not want to accept the amendment, did not want to accept our amendment, because it would strengthen the commitment by including specific bycatch reduction.Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 408, the International Dolphin Program Act. With all due respect to my good friends from Maryland, Mr. Gilchrest, and from New Jersey, Mr. Saxton, this bill is not about protecting dolphins. This bill is about the U.S. Department of State arbitrarily dictating changes in U.S. law without consulting Congress until after the deed is done.In 1990, Mexico and Venezuela filed a formal complaint with GATT after the Mexican tuna was embargoed for not achieving comparability with the United States tuna fleet. The GATT panel ruled that the United States had no right to use trade restrictions on a product based on the way the product was made or harvested. This finding has broad implications for a variety of U.S. consumer protection, health and safety, and environmental laws. However it is important to point out that the panel did not address the dolphin-safe label itself.Since the ruling, Mexico has been pressuring the United States to change its dolphin protection law so that they can sell their tuna in the United States. No one knew until 1995 that the State Department and Mexico were negotiating a deal which is now known as the Panama Declaration. This agreement requires major changes to U.S. law. The State Department did not consult with Congress during the entire process, and now this agreement is being rammed through Congress.By codifying the Panama Declaration, H.R. 408, eliminates the embargo provision in the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which is based on the rate of dolphin kill. The bill allows tuna caught by nations which are members of the Inter American Tropical Tuna Commission [IATTC] to enter the U.S. market if the total mortality for all nations remains below 5,000 annually and allow some tuna caught by the IATTC nations to be labeled ``dolphin safe.'' This dolphin mortality level is double the amount of the 1996 dolphin mortality level for Mexico and other nations fishing in the eastern Pacific. There is no reason why the acceptable dolphin kill level should be set at 5,000, thus allowing IATTC nations a higher dolphin mortality for dolphin safe tuna sold in the United States.The measure also narrows the definition of ``dolphin safe'' so that the only excludable tuna would be that which involved the killing of no dolphins during the fishing operation. It would, however, allow unlimited harassment of dolphins. Mexico and other nations want this provision so that their tuna will be bought by unsuspecting Americans who trust that the tuna was caught without harassing dolphins. Mexico and other nations know the American consumer will not tolerate the slaughter of dolphins. This is why the U.S. tuna canning industry adopted the dolphin-safe label in the first place. Without a dolphin-safe label on tuna, consumers will not buy it. We should not change the definition without scientific evidence.Supporters of H.R. 408 claim that scientific information supports the legislation. This is not accurate. The National Marine Fisheries Service [NMFS] conducted a study of tuna by-catch in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean from dolphin, schoolfish, and log sets from 1989 to 1992. A pattern emerged showing that by-catch was generally low or nonexistent in dolphin sets, low to moderate in school sets and high to very high in log sets. There is no doubt that a fishing method using the chase and netting of dolphins results in a lower by-catch of other species, such as sea turtles and sharks. While the by-catch issue has merit and deserves attention, the Panama Agreement does not resolve the problem. Other nondolphin methods of fishing for tuna are not being considered.More importantly, scientists have no evidence that the impacts of high speed chase and netting are not harmful to dolphins or dolphin populations. Some dolphin populations are chased more than once a day, with more than 3 million animals chased every year. Information from the NMFS biologists studying these populations indicates that they are currently stable at about one-fifth of their original size. NMFS' own scientists and the IATTC have reported that these stocks show no signs of recovery. We have no idea if the dolphin-set method impacts the dolphin fecundity or mortality.During committee markup I offered an amendment on bycatch reduction. The issue of bycatch should be addressed in this fishery and every other fishery with strong bycatch reduction requirements. Mr. Gilchrest was willing to accept the amendment. However, word came down to the committee that the State Department was firmly opposed to any changes in the legislation. The State Department didn't want to accept the amendment, because it would strengthen the commitment by including specific bycatch reduction program. What really troubles me is that the State Department did not base their position on the bycatch reduction program on science or the environment. Instead, the State Department's sole concern was political expediency.The State Department told Congress that H.R. 408 is unamendable. They have rejected any attempts at compromise. Congress should not acquiesce to a precedent that lowers our environmental laws, consumer protection, and health and safety laws just because another nation desires to sell its products in America. If the goal of H.R. 408 is to increase trade and open our markets to Mexico, the State Department should come clean. They should not hide behind a veil of environmentalism.Let's vote to protect dolphins and the environment, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 408.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 1420. This compromise clearly establishes the conservation mission of the National Wildlife Refuge System while ensuring the compatible wildlife-dependent recreation continues to have a place within the system as well. It requires that all uses of the system meet the same objective tests of compatibility.If and when hunting, bird watching, or other forms of wildlife-dependent recreation are found compatible with wildlife conservation, they are given priority treatment over nonwildlife-dependent uses of the system. This is a sound policy that ensures conservation is paramount, while providing maximum opportunities for compatible wildlife-dependent recreation for the public. Our job here is to provide a good blueprint for managing the refuge system and let the wildlife management professional take it from there. This bill does that. We should pass it and let the professional get back to work.Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1420 is a good example of bipartisanship, perhaps more appropriately, nonpartisanship. I want to commend Secretary Babbitt, the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young], the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton], the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller], the ranking member, and the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Dingell], who is here, as mentioned by the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young], and the various interest groups for all their hard work in crafting legislation that satisfies a diversity of needs while preserving a fundamental mission of the system.Mr. Speaker, I might say that that lineup of people that I just enumerated is a living example of diversity of needs while preserving the fundamental mission of the House of Representatives.Perhaps we can apply the same approach to address the backlog of management needs plaguing our wildlife refuges. If the refuge system had adequate resources, the various user groups might not be fighting each other so much over access and management decisions. The House's adoption of this legislation today is a significant step forward in recognizing the importance of wildlife refuges and addressing their problems.I urge, as the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young] did, all of our colleagues to support the bill.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume and I rise in strong support of the bill.However, I would like to add that, hopefully, the funding for Sea Grant, the funding numbers for the Sea Grant proposal here, are more accurate than those recently assigned to the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Sensenbrenner]. This represents a compromise, Mr. Chairman. Perhaps those numbers the gentleman from Wisconsin had assigned to him by the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] also represent a compromise.But this represents a compromise, Mr. Chairman, between the Committee on Resources and the Committee on Science, which shares jurisdiction with the Committee on Resources over the research component of Sea Grant.The bill reauthorizes the National Sea Grant College Program, which for over 30 years has addressed important local, regional, and national marine resource management problems through education, research, and public outreach.The compromise text, Mr. Chairman, reauthorizes Sea Grant for 3 years. It clarifies the roles of the national office and the Sea Grant colleges. It strengthens competitive peer review, as the gentleman from New Jersey mentioned, particularly for grants and contracts for research, education and outreach, and generally brings Sea Grant up to date as a modern education and research program.The authorization levels in the bill will force some belt-tightening at the national Sea Grant office but will provide for modest growth in funding for programs and projects carried out by the Sea Grant colleges themselves. These activities are the heart and soul of the Sea Grant Program and are parts of the program that must be preserved, especially in difficult budget times.Since 1968, speaking from personal experience, Mr. Chairman, the University of Hawaii's Sea Grant College Program has been a useful resource in the areas of aquaculture, marine biotechnology, coastal processes, coastal pollution and reef ecology. In the State of Hawaii marine resources are vital. Hawaii's coastal resources, which are world-renowned tourist attractions, generate nearly 40 percent of our gross State product. The value of our coastal resources is dependent on their health and beauty.I want to express my appreciation for the cooperation the minority has received from the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] and the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young] and their staffs. H.R. 437 is not really a bipartisan bill, Mr. Chairman, it is a nonpartisan bill. I think all of us who represent coastal areas have long appreciated the benefits of this practical, noncontroversial program.We would have been on the floor nearly 2 years ago reauthorizing this popular and pragmatic program if ideology had not interfered. On that note, I appreciate the cooperation extended by the leadership of the Committee on Science in the person of the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Sensenbrenner] and his staff in working out this compromise. Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate the work, in addition, of my good friend, whom I had the pleasure of working with in a previous committee, the Minerals Subcommittee, the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert].I hope this new spirit of cooperation leads to more timely authorization of marine research and oceanography programs, which are so vital not only to this Nation but to the planet, Mr. Chairman, over which the two committees share jurisdiction. This is a good start on a very good bill reauthorizing a popular program. I urge the House and all of our colleagues to support this legislation.Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "title": "VETERANS' CEMETERY PROTECTION ACT OF 1997",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, before I make my remarks, I would like to extend my gratitude to the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert]. I have had the pleasure of working with him in the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources of the Committee on Resources where he was the chair and I was the ranking member on that committee. We got to know each other very well, able to understand our problems and work to solve them in a mutual fashion. It turns out by sad coincidence that we had a mutual interest in the Veterans' Cemetery Protection Act.Mr. Speaker, I will relate to Members in the course of my remarks the circumstances that took place at Punchbowl and elsewhere out in the Hawaiian Islands with respect to the desecration of our cemeteries there. It was with an equal degree of sadness that I learned that the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] had experienced similar problems and difficulties in Riverside and we found out that this was in fact a nationwide problem. With his usual regard for acting quickly on matters, the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] and I were able to put together this bill and receive the kind and prompt attention of the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde] in the Committee on the Judiciary. I am sure I am speaking for the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] and myself in expressing not only our personal regard to the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde], but with respect to this particular legislation, the promptness with which the gentleman and his staff dealt with this particular bill is something to be admired and we are very, very grateful to him.I want to thank the gentleman from Florida [Mr. McCollum] as well for making a significant contribution in improving the bill. I am sure that the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] agrees with me that the amendments that were put in during committee have been very, very beneficial to the bill.I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Stump] for his interest right from the very, very beginning, obviously with his background and experience in the Committee on Veterans' Affairs; nonetheless, his approval of and support for the bill has been very valuable in moving it forward to this point. I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Frank] for his interest in the bill.Obviously, Mr. Speaker, my colleagues can tell from the list of individuals that I have spoken about today that this is a nonpartisan bill. It has nothing to do with political parties; it has everything to do with our regard for the United States of America and the symbolic importance of what is involved in the Veterans' Cemetery Protection Act.Mr. Speaker, today then I rise to voice my strong support for H.R. 1532, the Veterans' Cemetery Protection Act of 1997 which I am introducing, as I indicated, along with my colleague from California [Mr. Calvert]. This bill instructs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to significantly increase the criminal penalties for theft and wilful vandalism at national cemeteries. The penalties under this bill are clear and would send an unmistakable message to those who chose to desecrate the final resting place of our veterans.In a national cemetery anyone convicted of vandalism that causes a damage of less than $1,000 can be fined and serve a maximum prison term of 1 year. Anyone convicted of vandalism that exceeds $1,000 can receive penalties of a maximum 10-year prison term and a fine. In addition, anyone convicted of hiding, stealing or selling national cemetery property could be sentenced to a maximum 15-year prison term and corresponding fine.Mr. Speaker, I know for some Members this may be almost the first time they are hearing this kind of discussion. It may sound to them almost impossible that anyone would be hiding, stealing or selling national cemetery property, but unfortunately this is a fact of contemporary life. The time to act on this legislation therefore is now. How many more times do we want to open the newspaper, listen to a radio account, or watch the evening news and learn of another act of shocking desecration occurring at one of our national cemeteries?Let me recount the most recent examples for my colleagues. In 1994, a grave was opened at Ball's Bluff National Cemetery, and the remains of the soldier were scattered about presumably by a relic hunter.In 1996, Riverside National Cemetery, as the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] indicated, the second largest national cemetery in the Nation, was vandalized by a person or persons who stole engraved bronze markers from 128 graves. A few months before, thieves stole over 500 markers from a storage facility at the cemetery. They attempted to sell the markers to a recycling plant for financial gain.Finally, the most recent act of wilful vandalism, which occurred in Hawaii and New Jersey. On April 19, 1997 seven Oahu cemeteries, including the Hawaii Veterans' Cemetery in Kaneohe and the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific at Punchbowl were vandalized. Racist and profane words were spray-painted on grave markers, cemetery walls and even on the chapel of the National Memorial Cemetery. These acts were an insult to the people buried there, their families and the entire Hawaii community. I feel deeply for the relatives who are still experiencing the pain caused by this outrage.Mr. Speaker, I can scarcely get across today in words the anguish that people felt when viewing the circumstances of the vandalism at Punchbowl and elsewhere. What still gives one faith in the human spirit to triumph over tragedy is the pure unselfishness of the State and local government, veterans groups and community individuals who stepped up to the task of repairing the damage. Currently the estimated costs of repairing and cleaning up these cemeteries is between $20,000 and $25,000.Almost immediately Governor Benjamin Cayetano pledged to mobilize veterans, active duty U.S. military, the Hawaii National Guard and youth groups like the Hawaii Youth Challenge. He asked Maj. Gen. Edward Richardson, the State Adjutant General, and Walter Ozawa, Veterans Services Director, to work with Adm. Joseph Prueher, the Pacific Commander in Chief, to enlist help in the joint cleanup effort.The human spirit was renewed by the efforts of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, whose president, Ken Huber, called the desecration of the national cemetery an unconscionable act and affront to all the men and women in the Armed Services. The Paralyzed Veterans notified Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown that on behalf of the PVA members and in recognition of the sacrifices of all veterans the PVA would cover the cost of repairing and restoring the national cemetery. Other local Hawaii veterans groups posted reward moneys for information leading to the apprehension and conviction of these vandals.The spirit was further renewed by the actions of individuals, more than 700 of whom signed up to help at Punchbowl Cemetery. Because of the expertise and harmful chemicals required for most of the cleanup, only a handful could be used at any one time. But that did not stop Vi DeCaires from working to clean a grave, scrubbing the granite marker with a toothbrush. She said the people buried here have given so much to us. I just wanted to give back.Dorothy Tamashiro volunteered because her husband Harold is buried at Punchbowl. He was a member of the World War II 100th Infantry Battalion. According to Dorothy, ``when I saw the news I started to cry. So when the phone number came up on the screen I volunteered.''Then there was Lilla LeVine, who worked to clean the grave of Army Sgt. Maj. Earl R. Davidson, a veteran of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. ``How sad to think he did all this and this would happen to him,'' she said. ``He is a person, not just a stone.'' ``He is a person, not just a stone. He had a life and a family and he fought for his country through three wars. I hope he knows we are taking care of this as much as we can.''And most recently, on May 18, vandalism estimated at $10,000 darkened the sky of the 133-year-old Beverly, New Jersey National Cemetery where Veterans of Foreign War posts from throughout the State have come together on each Memorial Day for 52 years. Vandals tore down flagpoles, pulled memorial benches from their cement foundations and ruined the entrance garden. Here again veterans groups have posted reward moneys for information leading to the apprehension of the vandals as well as money to repair the damages to the cemetery.I am pleased to inform my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that because of the efforts of a number of individuals and groups, the last of the hate messages and graffiti was removed just prior to Memorial Day at Punchbowl with the help of the $21,000 donated thus far to the cleanup. Vandals can never ``tarnish what our heroes have left us,'' Honolulu Mayor Jeremy Harris said during the Memorial Day ceremony.Today we are responding to the call to keep our heroes untarnished with the introduction of this act. Our Constitution provides many freedoms and rights. It does not provide us the right to physically destroy what is not ours, even if it is to send a message. With rights come responsibilities, and it is our responsibility today as Members of Congress to ensure the right to be laid to rest in hallowed ground, like those men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation, is not compromised or profaned.",

    "title": "JUVENILE CRIME CONTROL AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION ACT OF 1997",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 1818, the Juvenile Crime Control and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1997. Earlier this year, the House considered and passed H.R. 3, the Juvenile Crime Control Act of 1997, which is directed at increasing the Federal penalties for violent juvenile crime. H.R. 1818 provides a complement to H.R. 3. It provides the prevention component of a comprehensive approach to addressing juvenile crime. This bill proves that both sides can work together and craft a balanced approach to juvenile crime. I am proud to be a cosponsor of it.H.R. 1818 makes a number of changes to current law to increase the flexibility of States to treat status offenders in the most appropriate manner. For example, it retains the four core requirements of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 and slightly modifies three of them. The core requirement mandating States to reduce the disproportionate number of minorities confined in secure facilities was strengthened and clarified. H.R. 1818 requires States to reduce disproportionate minority confinement by addressing both delinquency prevention efforts and system improvement efforts. However, it prohibits the establishment of numerical standards or quotas. The measure tries to ensure that prevention efforts are targeted to communities where a disproportionate number of minorities are committed to the juvenile justice system. H.R. 1818 also altered the sight and sound separation requirement to prohibit regular contact, but allow for supervised, incidental contact such as passing in a hallway. This does not mean that Congress is reducing its focus on this important core requirement.Last, the core requirement that prohibits the housing of juveniles in adult facilities was modified to build additional flexibility into the law by extending the period of time for which juveniles can be held in a facility with adults, prior to an initial court appearance, to 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays. States must still enforce the sight and sound separation requirement. In addition, it allows juveniles to be held for longer periods of time in facilities with adults in rural areas as long as there is no existing acceptable alternative placement, the parent or legal guardian of the juvenile involved consents, and it is approved in advance by the court. Such placement is, however, required to be reviewed periodically, at intervals of not more than 5 days for the duration of the detention or confinement to ensure it is the appropriate placement for such youth. Also, courts are urged to use this exception carefully.Compliance with the four core requirements is still Congress' goal. H.R. 1818 tries to make it easier for States to comply with the core requirements by allowing States to receive 50 percent of the formula money and the other 50 percent depending on their compliance with the four requirements. Under current law, if a State is not in compliance with the four requirements, then it loses all of the formula money.In addition, H.R. 1818 consolidates current discretionary programs into a flexible block grant program entitled the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant Program. In order for a State to receive any money under the prevention block grant, States must participate in the formula grant program and agree to use 95 percent of the funds they receive to fund local projects. H.R. 1818 also requires States to develop a plan to reduce and prevent juvenile crime with the assistance of community-based organizations and organizations in the local juvenile justice system which carry out programs, projects, or activities to prevent juvenile delinquency.The block grants will be allocated in the following manner: 50 percent on the basis of how many people in the State are under the age of 18, and the other 50 percent on the annual average number of arrests for serious crimes committed in the eligible State by juveniles. The prevention block grant will help juvenile justice officials in Hawaii and in other States fund prevention programs, substance abuse programs, support programs for children who have little or no family life, and programs that would give State court judges an alternative program to deal with certain juvenile offenders instead of sending them to correctional facilities.Everyone here knows that the nature of juvenile crime has changed drastically over the years. We have only to look through the paper to see younger people committing more violent crimes. Today's youths need to understand that they will be punished accordingly for crimes committed. However, that is only half of the battle. It is our duty to reach to our children, to get them involved in their communities, and to prevent them from taking part in dangerous activities in the first place. H.R. 1818 is an important component in our fight to meet this new challenge. It will help States prevent, reduce, and control juvenile crime. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1818.",

Proper conservation and management of the Pacific salmon is more important to both the United States and Canada than confrontation.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I will support H.R. 2014, the Taxpayer Relief Act.Yet I cannot rise without sharing my greatest concern with the tax bill, the airline ticket tax. The changes proposed in the airline ticket tax will have an adverse effect on Hawaii's people and on our economy. The segment portion of the domestic ticket tax is unfair. It is particularly unfair to Hawaii where Aloha, Hawaiian, and Mahalo, our local inter-island carriers, provide short-haul trips between the islands. Our unique geography as an island chain makes air travel a necessity. Unlike other areas of the country, we do not have a choice. If individuals want to travel from island to island, we have to fly. In order to make it economical for our people, Aloha, Hawaiian, and Mahalo island hop. The domestic airline ticket tax shifts the burden to low-cost, short-haul carriers. These are our local carriers and this will hurt Hawaii.The ticket tax increase on international flights from $6 to $24 is another concern. Tourism is Hawaii's largest industry. It is a large industry for many States of the Union. International visitors are a vital part of our tourism industry.Mr. Speaker, I will not dwell any further on the ticket tax except to say that I will work with all my energy to repeal these provisions in the future as we proceed to a tax bill next year.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2014. The conference report we are voting on today is an improvement over the version that initially passed the House in June. I voted against that measure for a number of reasons: It denied the full benefits of the child deduction to hard-working, low-income taxpayers who avail themselves of the earned income tax credit; it opened up enormous loopholes that would have fully or partially excluded millions of American workers from the protection of labor laws and fundamental benefits like Social Security and worker compensation; and it short changed low and middle-income taxpayers, denying them a fair share of its tax cuts.The bill before us today remedies those deficiencies in whole or large measure.Yesterday, the House passed the spending bill that sets our Nation on a path to have a balanced budget by 2002. The bill we are voting on today provides tax relief for our citizens--tax relief that is paid for.We have arrived at this point because of the courageous vote taken in 1993. The 1993 budget agreement was a 5-year deficit reduction package. It was a fiscally sound decision. As a result of the deficit reduction package our Nation has a healthy economy.Unfortunately, my constituents in Hawaii have not benefited from the economic upswing to the same extent as the rest of the Nation. Hawaii needs an economic stimulus. The balanced budget tax relief agreement we are voting on today will help us. It is not a silver bullet, but it will benefit a great many hard-pressed people and small businesses in Hawaii.I am voting for this bill not because it is perfect, but because on the balance it helps working families and the middle class. It helps the people of Hawaii.The bill helps Hawaii families. It provides a child tax credit of $400 a child in 1998 and increases to $500 a child thereafter for children age 16 and under. The credit phases out for couples with adjusted gross incomes of $110,000 and individuals with incomes of $75,000.The bill helps Hawaii college students. It provides a tax credit of up to $1,500 a year for the first 2 years of college and a tax credit of up to $1,000 for later years. Eligibility phases out for couples with incomes between $80,000 and $100,000 and individuals with incomes of between $50,000 and $60,000.The bill helps Hawaii homeowners. Married couples may exclude up to $500,000--single individuals may exclude up to $250,000--of capital gains from the sale of a primary residence. In Hawaii, this provision will be particularly helpful to residents whose principal investment is their home.The bill provides Hawaii with broad based capital gains reduction. Capital gains come from the owning of assets such as stock, bonds, homes, real estate, and businesses. The top capital gains tax rate drops from 28 percent to 20 percent. This rate will drop further to 18 percent, effective in 2001, for individuals who hold assets for 5 years or longer. For married couples with incomes less than $41,200 the capital gains tax rate drops from 15 percent to 10 percent. The rate will drop further to 8 percent, effective in 2001, for married couples who currently earn less than $41,200 and who hold assets for 5 years or longer. The bill provides Hawaii with estate tax relief. The estate tax will increase from the current $600,000 to $1 million. It will be phased in over a 10-year period.The bill provides Hawaii with expanded IRA--Individual Retirement Account--opportunities. It creates new IRA Plus accounts. Contributions are not deductible, but interest, dividends, and capital gains accumulate tax free. Allows penalty free withdrawals for first time home purchases. Further, withdrawals are tax free if the account is held for at least 5 years and the account holder is at least 59\\1/2\\. Income limits on traditional IRA's are raised.The bill helps Hawaii small business. Self-employed small business people will be able to deduct 100 percent of their health and insurance costs--the current deduction is 40 percent, reinstates the home office business deduction, and provides an immediate jump in the estate tax threshold to $1.3 million--$2.6 million for couples--for small family farms and businesses. This provision is important, because it enables continued family ownership of small farms and businesses from one generation to the next.Yet, I cannot rise without sharing my greatest concern with the tax bill: the airline ticket tax. The changes proposed in the airline ticket tax will have an adverse affect on Hawaii's people and our economy. The segment portion of the domestic ticket tax is unfair. It is particularly unfair to Hawaii where Aloha, Hawaiian, and Mahalo, our local interisland carriers, provide short-haul trips between the islands. Our unique geography as an island chain makes air travel a necessity. Unlike other areas of the country we do not have a choice. If individuals want to travel from Island to island we have to fly. In order to make it economical for our people Aloha, Hawaiian, and Mahalo island hop. The domestic airline ticket tax shifts the burden to low-cost short haul carriers. These are our local carriers. This will hurt Hawaii.The ticket tax increase on international flights from $6 to $24 is another concern. Tourism is Hawaii's largest industry. International visitors are a vital part of our tourism industry. The change in the ticket tax on international flights puts a greater tax burden on international visitors. International tourism is a major foreign exchange earner for the United States. It is one of the bright spots in our balance of payments picture. It generates millions of American jobs. Why do we create a disincentive to travel to the United States.Mr. Speaker, I will not dwell on the airline ticket tax any further, except to say that I will work with all my energy to repeal these provisions in the future.This is an important day for the people of Hawaii and our Nation. H.R. 2014 provides the people of Hawaii and our Nation with tax relief. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition and I am sorry to have to do this, particularly because I value my friendship with the gentleman from Arizona and with my dear friend, the gentleman from Mississippi, as well. As someone on the steering committee of the impact aid coalition and someone who was education chair in my State and had to try and deal with the implications of the failure to have the level of funding necessary for impact aid, I find myself in this uncomfortable position of having to oppose the amendment. I hope, actually, by the time this discussion is over they maybe would consider withdrawing it or not bringing it to a vote in the hopes that we will not end up in a situation where people can say, ``Oh, well, I was for impact aid and you were against impact aid.'' Because, very frankly, and I hope that we can get attention for everything that is being said from everyone before we are through, that when this comes down to a question of funding, which is what it does, we are actually in the wrong venue.This should be a line item in the Department of Defense budget. This is not a position, I would tell the gentleman from Arizona, that I am just coming up with in response to this amendment. This argument goes back to an argument I had as chair of the education committee in the State of Hawaii and brought up here to Washington almost 2 decades ago. This should be a line item in the Department of Defense budget. For those Members who do not know this, we fund our schools overseas at 100 cents on the dollar. Not my answer to the gentleman from Arizona, but my response, and I trust he would understand the difference both from a political sense and personally, is that I not only understand the capital problem that he is having, the capital assets problem in terms of the facilities in the school, but also in paying the teachers and in the operating expenses that are involved. To have the children, the dependents of our military personnel, dependent on the particular circumstances of property taxes, however we do the funding in Arizona or Hawaii or Mississippi or elsewhere, is virtually, from my point of view, immoral. It is not fair. Those children are there by the assignment of the U.S. Government and their parents are there in our name acting in our behalf, and this should be funded out of the Department of Defense as an obligation.If we can fund our schools at 100 cents on the dollar in Korea, in Germany, or wherever, and I suppose if things keep on going, in Bosnia by the time we get through, then we should certainly do it in the confines and the boundaries of the United States of America.My first essential point to the gentleman is that rather than pit workers against children or one element of government against another element of government, or however people choose to characterize this debate for their own purposes, not for ours in terms of our discussion, we are going to end up with that kind of a dichotomy being put forward, and I believe it is a false dichotomy. I do not doubt for a moment that the funding is needed in exactly the way that he says it is, and I would support it. This is why I think we should work together within the coalition, and this is no news to those who know of my participation in the coalition, that we should move this, and I would like to work with the gentleman, and anybody else who is interested in it, in moving the whole funding nexus from the Department of Education and into where it properly belongs, into the Department of Defense.Pending that, I think it is an exercise not so much in futility, but an exercise in false confrontation or false dichotomy to try to pull the money from, whether it is NLRB or wherever else it might have come from, in order to do the necessary funding here. We need to make the fight, it seems to me, on the basis of the merits of the Impact Aid Program across the board and that that should be funded as a result of our commitment to the dependents of our military personnel across the board.I do want to say that rather than continue in a vein as to which one of us is more morally correct or whether or not one is depriving an essential necessity of governmental operation in the United States of the funding necessary to do its job in order to benefit the children.The CHAIRMAN.

But I have been through this.I have had someone attack me for no other reason than personal, political gain. I have had to go through the process of being sued for slander by someone who attacked me, who attacked my integrity, who came after me for no purpose other than to try to destroy me politically, and I had to go through it. I had to have an attorney.Anybody who stands here and talks about an outside group being able to come into this House and make a complaint, as if we are cutting off access, people who have no desire other than to come and to take them apart, not just politically but destroy them as a person.I am willing to submit myself at any point to the judgment of my peers in this House. But I am unwilling to open up the floodgates of the crime of slander and libel against a Member that will surely come with this. I have been through it.I ask any Member to think about what it is like when all of this is put out in the newspapers and people ask them about it and the attack is on them, and they wake up in the middle of the night in frustration and rage, knowing that they are innocent.I was attacked by somebody who altered a tape on the grounds that he knew what I was really saying, so he had altered the tape to make sure that everybody else would know it. He found an attorney that could come after me. And the day before the trial started, after all the depositions, after all the accusations, the suit was withdrawn. I was left to hang. And do my colleagues know what the attorney said to me? ``If you want to counter sue, you are going to have to pay for that.'' This was done for no other purpose than for political attack.I respect the work that was done with this.

Here it is, 1,299 closely spaced pages of small print.I am sure the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston] and the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Cardin] have seen this volume. They probably see it in their dreams at night, tumbling off shelves and burying them. But the fact of the matter is that this contains the Constitution, Jefferson's Manual, and the rules and practices of the House of Representatives. That is what we are talking about.That is why I think that this amendment that the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning] and I are bringing forward deserves your favorable consideration. We should have the full committee if you are dealing with the two fundamental issues, whether the scope should proceed forward or whether there should be subpoenas issued, to be dealt with in the manner in which it has been discussed with this amendment.I have been told, and I see that the Judiciary chairman is here, that if this is an amendment sponsored by the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning] and the gentleman from Hawaii [Mr. Abercrombie], it should either pass unanimously or be defeated unanimously.I am not quite sure how that will work out, but I think what it indicates is that this is not a partisan consideration. We are putting this forward because we believe it is in the interest of the House as an institution, because we love this body, because we have sworn an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, and when you defend the House of Representatives, when you defend the basic fundamental integrity of the House, you are defending this Constitution, you are defending these rules. This book is as sacred as we get in a secular context in our House of Representatives in our country.Therefore, I would like to say at this point, then, that the Members, especially the gentleman from Maryland and the gentleman from Louisiana, deserve our thanks for their hard work, their levelheadedness, and I want to say their largeness of spirit. The manner in which this has been conducted is proof of that, and I am very, very grateful for this opportunity to speak on it.All we are saying here is that only the subcommittee authority be renewed from its source when it moves into new areas of investigation. By clarifying that point, we strengthen the measure before us, we strengthen the Ethics Committee and its work, we strengthen the integrity of this House, we strengthen democracy.

These instructions will set aside a small amount of funding for the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys to provide assistance to the victims of human rights abuses in the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands.Since at least 1984, Federal officials have expressed concern about the CNMI alien labor system. Worker complaints over wages and working conditions are continuing undiminished according to the third annual report of the ``Federal-CNMI Initiative''. The governments of the Philippines and China have expressed concern about the treatment of their citizens in this U.S. Commonwealth and allegations persist regarding the CNMI's inability to protect workers against crimes such as illegal recruitment, battery, rape, child labor, and forced prostitution.Without Rep. Miller's language in H.R. 2267, individuals who have been the subject of human rights abuses--right here in the United States--have only the charity of private relief organizations to rely upon for help. In Hawaii, the Filipino Solidarity Coalition is currently providing sanctuary to a young girl named ``Katrina'' who came to Hawaii as a government witness. When Katrina was 14 she was brought to the CNMI by an employer who promised her a good job and fair wages in the restaurant industry. When she arrived in the CNMI her hopes for a better life were destroyed. She discovered that the employer had lured her to the CNMI under false pretenses. Not only was she confined to her assigned living quarters but she was also forced into service as a prostitute. Katrina had few options and even less money but she escaped her confines and filed suit against her employer with the help of the local Philippine consulate. When Katrina's actions were revealed to her employer, her life was threatened. To escape the abusive situation, the consulate helped her to find refuge in Guam. However, Guam's close proximity to her former employer still put Katrina in a dangerous situation.Through the help of the Filipino Solidarity Coalition, Katrina managed to escape to Hawaii where local donations and a small grant from the Department of Labor helped to provide her shelter, food, and further legal assistance. However, there are many others who remain in the CNMI still suffering the abuse and indignity that Katrina managed to escape. I appreciate the Chairman's support of the Miller language which will help those like Katrina who are victims of human rights abuse, not far away in a foreign country, but right here in the United States of America.",

The amendment removes the bill's current provision that is an impediment to provide for a fair and accurate census in the year 2000. This issue is very important to the people in my district. In fact, this is an issue that is important to all my House colleagues. We must work to ensure that all individuals are counted so that their voices may be heard.The 1990 census missed at least 4 million people because, as the Bush administration's Census Director at the time said, ``enumeration cannot count everybody.'' We in Congress must take steps to resolve and correct this situation. The Mollohan-Shays amendment seeks to address the issue and make the 2000 census more accurate.The National Academy of Sciences and virtually the entire statistical profession, including the American Statistical Association, has endorsed sampling as the best and most efficient way to achieve an accurate census count.The Justice Department under the Reagan, Bush and Clinton administrations has consistently held that sampling is constitutional.Opponents of the amendment claim that sampling opens up the census count to political manipulation. In response, the sponsors of the amendment went out of their way to address that issue. An independent board of experts will monitor every aspect of the census to guard against any bias or manipulation. This safeguard creates a more effective barrier against fraud and error than under the present system.The Congressional Research Service analyzed the Hastert census language that is currently in the bill, and it is quite clear that this language will not work. According to the memorandum, ``The case law makes it clear that this authorization, if enacted, would run afoul of constitutional barriers to congressional conferral either of standing or of ripeness or both.'' The memorandum goes on to say ``* * * it appears extremely likely that the Supreme Court would either strike down the provision, or disregard it.'' If my House colleagues are concerned about constitutionality they cannot support the Hastert language.The Mollohan-Shays amendment works toward a fair and accurate census. I urge my colleagues to support the Mollohan-Shays amendment.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am delighted to be here today, particularly in the company of the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton], my good friend. I too want to pay tribute not just to him and his great leadership on this issue but to the especially strong staff support we have received along the way with the enactment of this bill.Madam Speaker, I am just getting to the floor now because we have had the opportunity over the past couple of hours to be meeting on the questions of travel, tourism and the world, not only in relation to the United States but in relation one to another as people throughout the world.Madam Speaker, I cannot emphasize enough to Members that in paying particular attention to this species as covered under the Asian Elephant Conservation Act, we are taking a giant step forward in seeing to it not only that we respect the ecological consequences for the Asian elephant as such, but that we recognize that in this context, the people of the world are coming to know that we are all interrelated, and we are very, very hopeful that we will be able to fund as a result of this act partnerships, international partnerships, that will result in people being able to view the Asian elephant, to understand through the conservation of the Asian elephant its relationship to ecological balance, environmental balance in South Asia and that this is beneficial on a planetary basis when all of the species of the world understand their interrelationship.This is then a modest step in the effort to protect the existing Asian elephant herds from multiple sources of danger, including poaching for meat, hides, teeth and bones as well as capture for domestication and the encroachment of humans and civilization, so-called.Madam Speaker, the population of Asian elephants as has been pointed out, has been dwindling steadily and now numbers roughly 40,000 animals. It is an incredible thing to contemplate, as we did in the course of our examination in the committee hearings, what such a relatively small number of great animals and of course I must say parenthetically, Madam Speaker, that my respect for and admiration for the diversity of life on this planet was only enhanced by the hearings that we had. This is indeed one of God's most magnificent creatures and indeed represents something unique. Not everyone is aware that the Asian elephant has been a partner with humankind throughout all of the thousands of years of its existence. That relationship is now threatened by the advance of modern life.Maybe advance is almost the wrong word, Madam Speaker. But nonetheless we are realizing more and more that this great creature of South Asia, the Asian elephant, represented a true symbiosis between humankind and the animal kingdom that is now threatened. The numbers are less than 10 percent of the numbers of African elephants in the wild. I think that that is a very sobering statistic. The African elephant of course has received great publicity. It also of course is magnificent in its presentation of self in the wild and has attracted the imagination and admiration of people throughout the world. The Asian elephant being a blue collar animal, a working animal, a domesticated animal working in close proximity with human beings, has been ignored in the process.So this legislation will help prevent the eventual extinction of the Asian elephant as an endangered species. The future of these magnificent animals in the wild is in clear jeopardy. H.R. 1787 authorizes $5 million to fund projects crucial to the survival of the species. Our goals are to assist and support the conservation of elephant range, as the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] has enunciated so clearly and to support the United Nations Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Although wild Asian elephants are scattered across 13 Asian countries, there are only 4 remaining herds containing 1,000 or more animals.Douglas H. Chadwick, a distinguished and honored scientist and author, wrote of these animals:Elephants are one of those animals by which we define the grandeur of creation. No larger life forms walk our earth and precious few are more intelligent. Elephants are more than just a part of the extraordinary variety of the plants and animals found in Asia's tropical forest. Elephants are one of the main reasons that the genetic bounty is there in the first place with the potential to provide humanity with new sources of food, fiber and pharmaceutical products. Elephants distribute seeds of perhaps one-third of all tropical trees. In some cases elephants are the only known agents of dispersal. To save Asian elephants is to save one of the principal shapers of biological diversity. To maintain habitat is to maintain the resources that enrich human communities over the long run.I am absolutely certain, Madam Speaker, speaking parenthetically that with the expansion of the Asian elephant habitat and with their preservation and conservation, we will see enormous increases in travel and tourism and by extension the awareness of the items that I am speaking of. Going back, then, in my quotation, ``To pass an Asian Elephant Conservation Act would be one of the most foresighted and yet practical, cost-effective things we can do for the benefit of Americans, people throughout Asia, and the world we all share.''H.R. 1787 received overwhelming support in the Committee on Resources, again under the leadership of the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton]. I was pleased to be an original cosponsor of the bill. Not only does H.R. 1787 enjoy strong bipartisan support in the House, Madam Speaker, but it has also been endorsed by such diverse groups that bears repeating, the American Zoological and Aquarium Association, the World Wildlife Fund, Wildlife Preservation Trust International, the Sierra Club, and Feld Entertainment, emphasizing the partnership we have in the private sector. Feld Entertainment is the owner of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus.It is clear that if we are to prevent the extinction of the Asian elephant, a number of coordinated and visible activities must be undertaken by the international community and host-range nations. I believe it bears repeating, Madam Speaker, as to what they might be:Protection of the remaining elephant populations and their habitat from further loss and degradation by establishing and managing special protected areas;Promotion of coexistence between people and elephants by developing and implementing sound management practices that would prevent or reduce conflict;Promotion of effective law enforcement through participation of local communities;Reduction of captures from the wild, and extension of care and humane management of the remaining domesticated population;Madam Speaker, I believe it has been stated but I believe again bears repeating that the Asian elephant as a participant in society as a domesticated work elephant, I was going to say workhorse, I guess is the equivalent, is now finding itself in the situation of being unemployed.The work elements associated with the Asian elephant are disappearing much as the workhorse did, as the great workhorses that my grandfather was associated with as a teamster in Buffalo, NY, the great eight-horse hitches that the great beer wagons that we see advertised now with Budweiser, they were working animals. My grandfather was the manager of the stables that carried baked goods on great wagons throughout Buffalo for the then existing Hall's Bakery. So horses, great workhorses, were displaced by engines, by the internal combustion engine. The same thing is happening to the Asian elephant. The elephants who worked under these circumstances need to be taken care of, need humane management and treatment, and this bill will help agencies and individuals and groups interested in this in completing that task. Finally, restoration of the congenial relationship that previously existed between people and elephants through education and awareness programs. And of course this is where travel and tourism can play a great role.Many groups and individuals contributed to the development of the bill. The Tiger and Rhinoceros Conservation Act is one to be cited. It would be administered by the Secretary of the Interior after consultation with the Administrator of AID. Instead of focusing on remedies appropriate for trade-related conservation issues, this bill emphasizes remedies that would address the human-elephant conflict resolutions that prevails throughout the Asian elephant's natural range. I think I have already made reference, Madam Speaker, to the African elephant and I am particularly grateful to the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young], the chair of our committee, who has been instrumental in working with the preservation and conservation of the African elephant and who realized that the Asian elephant emphasis that we have in this bill is an appropriate next step to take.The purpose then of H.R. 1787 is to assist initiatives in the Asian elephant range nations as well as regional and national agencies and organizations whose activities directly or indirectly promote Asian elephant habitat conservation. Then the bill would be funded in a manner so as not to affect funds currently earmarked for the African Elephant Conservation Act and the Rhino and Tiger Act. The legislation would specify that support would be provided for projects that would directly support and promote wild elephant management practices such as monitoring population trends of known populations, assessing the movement and the annual ranging patterns of known populations. We would emphasize law enforcement through community participation, develop management plans for managed elephant ranges, translocation of elephants, conflict resolution initiatives and community outreach and education. It specifically authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to fund projects addressing the use of domesticated elephants as such use relates to conservation of Asian elephants in the wild. It provides for multiplying the impact of funding by authorizing priority to be given projects which have matching funds from private sector sources.In that instance I, too, want to add my congratulations and grateful thanks to our colleague Andy Ireland, who brought this issue to our attention in an extraordinarily comprehensive way and in that context, Madam Speaker, I want to conclude by urging all of our colleagues to take advantage of the pioneering work that was done in the Committee on Resources previously with respect to conservation of the great animals in Africa and Asia and add to it then this great and magnificent representation of the symbiotic relationship of humankind and the animal world in the Asian elephant.Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from American Samoa [Mr. Faleomavaega].",

    "title": "CONCURRING IN THE SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H. CON. RES. 8, REGARDING CORAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Madam Speaker, before I rise in strong support of the Senate amendments to House Concurrent Resolution No. 8, I want to assure the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] that in the statement of the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller], that I submitted on the Asian elephant resolution, that it did not contain a statement, as rumored, that while he was in favor of increasing the number of Asian elephants in South Asia, that he was for decreasing the number of elephants on the Committee on Resources.Madam Speaker, this resolution brings much-needed attention to the crisis that coral reefs are facing worldwide. I commend yet once again the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] for his leadership in introducing and passing House Concurrent Resolution No. 8, and for focusing on the subcommittee's attention on the value of and threats to coral reefs.I also want to praise the efforts of the ranking member, the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller] for his concern over cyanide fishing and the need to promote sustainable coral reef fisheries, ideas incorporated in the Senate amendments to the resolution.Coral reefs, as I have every opportunity to observe, being from Hawaii, Madam Speaker, are vital to the environment and the economy of many islands and coastal States, territories, and nations. They are among the most biologically diverse and productive ecosystems on Earth, rivaling the tropical rain forests on land. The hard structure of the reef is built up over thousands of years by the secretions of tiny living coral animals, so a coral reef is truly a living structure. As a living structure, thousands, perhaps millions, of individual coral animals are dying, and others are taking their place on the reef at any one time.The problem now is that human activities have shifted that balance, and coral reefs are dying off at an alarming rate worldwide. Coral is very sensitive to water pollution, sedimentation, damage from boat groundings, or even simple physical contact by divers. These largely inadvertent injuries are a significant cause of the well-documented decline of coral reefs worldwide. Coral reefs are, in a sense, the canary in the coal mine of the ocean.A great deal of injury is also being inflicted on coral reefs, mainly in Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific through largely illegal fishing techniques. Cyanide and other elements, such as dishwashing liquids, are being used to stun fish for capture for the aquarium trade and for the live food fish trade.The demand for live food fish, fueled by increasing affluence in Asia, has resulted in widespread depletion of stocks of the preferred species. As a result, the live-capture boats are moving into even more remote and thus more pristine reefs. Most of the aquarium fish captured by these techniques end up in hobby tanks in the United States, I am sorry to say. Most of the live food fish end up on plates in the homes and restaurants of Southeast Asia.More damaging than the depletion of coral reef fisheries, these chemicals kill nearby coral, and divers scrambling to get fish out of the nooks and crannies of the reef often cause substantial physical damage to the reef. In fact, research has shown that cyanide kills reef-building corals at concentrations many thousands of times less than that used by live-capture divers. While depletion of certain fish species threatens the ecological balance of the reef by removing key predators and grazers, the destruction of the reef building corals themselves tears at the very fabric of the ecosystem.Although the State Department, NOA, the Department of the Interior and other agencies are working through the international coral reef initiative to identify and reduce threats to coral reefs, they need our help. Thus, this resolution before us today.These kinds of unsustainable fishing practices would not be occurring if powerful market forces were not at work. The U.S. and Asian consumer demands for reef fish is, in part, driving its destruction of coral reefs. Yet, how many aquarium hobbyists would purchase a wild-caught reef fish if they truly understood that in doing so they were contributing to the destruction of the reef environment that they sought to reproduce in their tank?Furthermore, if affordable alternatives to wild-caught fish were available, would the educated consumer not choose them? This has worked very well in the exotic bird trade, and we can do the same for reef aquarium species and specimens.Many of the countries where the reefs are being destroyed, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and others, have laws on the books that protect the reefs, but there is little money for enforcement, and the more lucrative the market, the more people are willing to risk the penalties in any case.So the keys are information and education. Only by identifying these destructive practices and consumer demands that drive them can we begin to eliminate or modify them, and only through the development of sustainable coral reef fisheries can reefs be saved.This concurrent resolution before us today, Madam Speaker, No. 8, brings the global plight of coral reefs before Congress. It is intended to raise the level of awareness of policymakers and asks us to do more.The scientific and environmental communities have declared 1997 the International Year of the Reef. We cannot stop ships from running aground on reefs, and we may not be able to stop global warming at this stage, but what better time for us to pay attention to the many problems plaguing coral reefs and seek practical solutions to those threats that we can address? If we do not do something soon, there may not be any reefs left to save.With these thoughts in mind, Madam Speaker, and again thanking the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] for his leadership on this issue, I urge the House to adopt the resolution.Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.",

Very few people are happy in any given year with the bill because it covers such a wide range of items.

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.Mr. Chairman, I want to speak in favor of the amendment that the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller] has just outlined. I want to make an appeal to Members of the House.Mr. Chairman, I am a Member of the House of Representatives, proud to serve here and I think, Mr. Chairman, you know that I have said on more than one occasion that respect for the House includes being able to win and also understand what losing is all about, being defeated.The last two amendments did not come out the way I voted. I understand that and I accept that. But, Mr. Chairman, what I am hoping is a basic sense of fairness can prevail. Those votes were close. People were paying strict attention to what it was they were voting on. And I think we have to give the best possible motivation and express goodwill toward one another with respect to our votes.So my appeal on asking Members to vote for this amendment is one based on fairness. With all due respect to the previous speakers, this is not a question of closing borders; this is a question of whether we are going to extend the same privileges explicit, I would say, Mr. Chairman, in the last two amendments to foreign-controlled corporations.Mr. Chairman, I do not think that this can be reduced to an argument about whether or not we are treating our western brothers and sisters fairly or those in the majority of areas where the grazing takes place. It is one thing for us to involve ourselves in a discussion as to what is the appropriate legislative approach on grazing land. It is another thing to subsidize foreign-controlled permittees. I do not see how we can make an argument based on fairness, based on fairness to the American taxpayer, that would allow us to do this.All the amendment of the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller] is saying is that if businesses come in and make these investments as a foreign-controlled permittee, that they should not be allowed to have the benefit of the American taxpayer dollar. This is not an assault on anyone overseas.Mr. Chairman, I would be very interested to see what kind of argument would be made when we look at the kind of laws that apply against Americans being involved with owning land and being able to extract minerals or to engage in other kinds of agricultural business in other countries.Mr. Chairman, we are always the ones that are expected to do the producing for others in terms of fairness. What we are asking for is fairness for the American taxpayer here. Surely those who in good conscience made their votes on the other two measures can look to that same conscience to see, is this really the intent of those who favored the law as it is presently applied? Is it really the intent that these foreign-controlled permittees should be involved in this way?Mr. Chairman, this is far from mischief. I do not think it is fair to characterize it that way. This is a fundamental question about what we have as a legislative foundation for the application of these laws. We have had our arguments, we have had our discussions as to whether the existing law and how it is applied, Mr. Chairman, is fair and appropriate. Surely it is a legitimate question. Far from being capricious or mischievous, it is a legitimate question as to whether the law ever intended this.I ask, Mr. Chairman, that as Members come to vote on this particular amendment, can they in good conscience say that it was the intent and is the intent of this legislation to subsidize the foreign-controlled permittees? I think an honest evaluation, a fair evaluation would come to the conclusion it is not. And therefore I ask that we vote favorably on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller] in the spirit of what has been accomplished here today in terms of the legislative process.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Florida [Ms. Ros-Lehtinen]; the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman]; the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon]; also the gentleman from California [Mr. Martinez] and the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Hamilton], and the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Pelosi] have led the way on this bill, on these series of bills.I rise in support of H.R. 2358. This bill relates to imprisonment, to abuse and human rights violations perpetrated on nonviolent political activists in the People's Republic of China. It goes without saying, Mr. Speaker, that U.S.-China relations are important, and that our government should pursue improved ties with China. It is equally important, however, that the pursuit of improved relations should not cause us to forget the victims of human rights abuses.Our concern stems from widely recognized standards of international behavior and our core values as a Nation. It is in the context of those values and standards, standards which the People's Republic of China has herself formally subscribed, and I want to emphasize to the Members, we are not trying to impose anything on the People's Republic of China, other than what the People's Republic has already signed up for.We as Members of Congress call the world's attention to ongoing human rights violations and prisoners of conscience in China and Tibet. One of the most effective means, Mr. Speaker, of directing attention to the plight of such prisoners is to focus on the circumstances of individual prisoners. By doing so, we transpose the issue from the realm of abstraction to real-life men and women whose bodies are subjected to torture and neglect, whose minds are cruelly punished with techniques deliberately designed to induce confusion, demoralization and despair.Time and again, ex-prisoners of repressive regimes tell us that the single most important gift they can receive is the news they are not forgotten by the outside world, that others know of their suffering and that others are working for their release. {time} 1745That is why the Congressional Human Rights Caucus and the Congressional Working Group on China and the emphasis in this bill is urging every Member of Congress to adopt a prisoner in China or Tibet, and to publicize his or her plight, and to demand his or her release.All of us, Mr. Speaker, can adopt one of these prisoners, make that prisoner our own, so they will not be forgotten. They will understand that the flicker of light of freedom will come from the floor of this House today and will shine, and those people will know it. It will warm their hearts and give them hope for the future.The self-executing rule for H.R. 2358 adds my amendment, which will include Mr. Ngodrup Phuntsog among the number of specifically named prisoners of conscience. Mr. Phuntsog is a Tibetan restaurateur whose crime was to provide tea and food to proindependence demonstrators. For this he was sentenced in 1989 on the spurious charge of espionage to 11 years in prison.Mr. Speaker, Mr. Phuntsog was sentenced to 11 years in prison. Think of it. We are gathered together here today on this floor, with all the freedoms at our command, and this gentleman sits in prison for 11 years, and an additional 4 years deprivation of political rights.It is feared that his treatment in Lhasa's Drapchi Prison is extremely harsh. We lack precise information on his health and treatment, but reports from our colleague, the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Frank Wolf] give cause for serious concern.Recently the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf] visited Tibet unofficially. He found widespread repression, including credible reports of the maltreatment of political prisoners, and my amendment helps direct the spotlight of international attention to the cell where Ngodrup Phuntsog and others are being held under conditions we can only imagine.My amendment complements the underlying bill by addressing the wider issue of human rights in China and Tibet. It calls for a policy which seeks the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience in China and Tibet, access to international humanitarian organizations in prisons in China and Tibet, to ensure that the prisoners are not being maltreated or neglected, and the commencement of negotiations between the People's Republic of China and the Dalai Lama without preconditions on the future of Tibet.I urge all my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, all my colleagues, to vote for the Nation's highest ideals, and to send, above all, a message of hope to prisoners of conscience in China and Tibet.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I will not take the 30 minutes, other than to say how proud I am to be able to stand here today and associate myself with the gentlewoman from Florida [Mrs. Fowler]. I have the good fortune, Mr. Speaker, to be associated, as well, with the gentlewoman from Florida [Mrs. Fowler] on the Committee on National Security, and in this instance I can say that I believe we are cooperating, if you will, in the same manner and in the same sense of commitment and dedication that is exemplified in the work on the Committee on National Security.This is, Mr. Speaker, most profoundly a human rights issue. It is not something that we are putting forward, or I should say the gentlewoman from Florida [Mrs. Fowler] has put forward, if I can speak for her in this instance, because of ideological considerations with respect to the very real differences that people may have with respect to questions of choice and abortion here in the United States. This, on the contrary, is a situation in which we are speaking of force.Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons that I became involved in political work in the first place was that I could not understand as a child, as a young man growing up, how people could do the things that they did that I discovered when I first was exposed to the Holocaust. I could not understand it. I could not comprehend it as a student.One of the things that propelled me in my academic career was to try to come to grips with what it was in us as human beings that caused us to be indifferent to the suffering of other human beings; in fact, to perpetrate death, terror, destruction, inhumanity, one to another.In this instance, Mr. Speaker, there is no question in my mind that the forced abortion and sterilization circumstances and actions which the gentlewoman from Florida [Mrs. Fowler] has outlined and which Amnesty International has chronicled is taking place.Mr. Speaker, this took place in Nazi Germany. If I learned anything over that period of time in my academic studies in my attempt to try to come to grips with what human beings are capable of doing to one another, I recognized that it is because we dehumanize other people that it is able to be done.Mr. Speaker, I believe you have had some experience yourself in warfare and in the destructive capacity that humankind has. We have not overcome it, but, hopefully, we learn something from it. One of the things I think that we learn, I hope that we learn, is that we cannot allow historical reference to simply be abstract, we have to see whether it applies in our own lives and our own time. It does little good.I can think, and, again, I would hope that I am not speaking for the gentlewoman from Florida [Mrs. Fowler] on this other than in a way that recognizes and is cognizant of the thrust of her philosophy behind putting this bill forward. It is one thing to recognize a Thomas More, that we must stand for those things which perk our conscience and which require us as human beings to make visible or expression of witness. That is what this is.I agree with the gentlewoman from Florida [Mrs. Fowler] that we are not in a position to command enforcement. That would be extraordinarily difficult. That is not an argument against it. That is an argument for us to stand up and do these things precisely because it is difficult.Bearing witnesses is not always an easy task. But because it involves logistical difficulties is not a reason to stop doing it or to urge that it be done. On the contrary, it seems to me it is even more pertinent and even more important that we stand up now.So this, I repeat, from my earlier espousal of the Ros-Lehtinen bill on human rights abuses toward prisoners in China and in Tibet, in China and Tibet, that we have to bring the light into the cells and we have to bring the light onto this situation of forced abortion and sterilization, not because we are trying to single out China and take a superior, a patronizing position, an imperialistic position, where we feel that we can condescend toward China in this regard. Quite the contrary. China is a signatory to various international covenants and treaties, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that is in the purview of the United Nations.Everything that we are doing with respect to these bills in general, and most particularly to this bill in particular, is a direct reflection of treaty and covenant obligations that we have as a nation, that China has as a nation, and that we as individuals surely express. It most certainly, I believe, exemplifies what we stand for when we take our oath of office, hold up our hand, Mr. Speaker, as all of us have been privileged to do on the floor of this House, to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.Inherent in that, that which has been given to us, the honor and privilege of serving here, is to reflect upon the philosophical basis of the origin of the Constitution which allows us to be free men and women here today. We are, in a very real sense, I believe, defending those who are unable totally to defend themselves under these circumstances.So, Mr. Speaker, I request the favorable attention of our colleagues. I hope that perhaps those young people might be in the same circumstances I found myself so many years ago, trying to understand how to be a human being, what it is that differentiates us from the other animals, the other species. I have come to the conclusion, and this bill is a visible manifestation of it, that all animals die, Mr. Speaker. The difference is in the details of their lives. And the details of our lives are such that we are able to reflect, we are able to imagine.Few animals are able to contemplate the nature of their deaths or the nature of the meaning of their deaths, let alone their lives. But we are capable, this species, homo sapiens, is capable of that and, in fact, is obligated to do that. We have to justify our lives on this Earth in the time given to us. This bill is one of the times we have to justify our lives. And in voting for it, I think we act on that obligation.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am not precisely sure of what the exact rule is, or what the Committee on Rules has put forward with respect to the possibility of an amendment of this nature. I have the greatest respect for the intentions of the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] in presenting this bill, both with respect to how the bill was put together and to what the implications of the bill are, and I would, far from speaking for him, nonetheless posit the proposition to the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] and Members of the House, that essentially what the gentleman from Mississippi is proposing is entirely consonant with the object of the bill before us.So in that regard, Mr. Speaker, I would like to just bring a bit of historical perspective to consideration of the bill.At one point, and I am sure the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] will recall, we had a Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee which concerned itself with, among other things, the terms and conditions of international trade on the high seas. I consider that I was a reasonably well-informed individual in my life prior to coming to the Congress, but nonetheless was rather shocked and very chagrined to discover the degree to which disregard for the rules of international trade and disregard for the contractual agreements that had been reached between the United States and other nations, particularly China, was the fact of the matter before us in that committee.We found that there were shipping trade violations, and I think the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Taylor] was a Member of that committee and could attest to the fact that I, among others, upon discovering it, simply could not understand why we do not enforce the rules we already have. I think we as Americans take some pride in the fact that we try to keep our agreements, we try to live up to our contracts. That was not taking place.We have just had recent evidence of what can happen when we do take a stand. The proposition of gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Taylor] is such that we can, if it is put forward and agreed to, take the kind of stand that has been exemplified, Mr. Speaker, in recent days with the decision of the Maritime Commission to fine certain Japanese companies, shipping companies, for not living up to the rules and regulations to which they had agreed and which we live up to.The fines were such that when they were imposed, that the executive, in the form, of course, of the President and his administration, was forced into the position, and, in fact, it may be apocryphal, but I heard at one point that the President or someone under his immediate authority said, can they do that? Who are these people? They are our Maritime Commission, and by God, they were doing their job. What their job was is not to turn the American people into suckers and saps, where they are not made to be fools. People know that when it is happening.One of the reasons there is cynicism abroad in the United States today is people know that they are being played for suckers. They do not like it. They want us, if we are on the floor of this House, free men and women elected by free men and women, to not be made fools of. They expect us to insist as legislators, as national legislators, that we carry these things out, that we see to it that the rules and regulations are obeyed. I think that is the intention of the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] with the bill.I would like to say that I support the idea of reciprocity, and would ask the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon], in the context of what is possible under the rules as applied to the bill, whether or not the intent of the proposal of the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Taylor], that is, that a review and reciprocity be instituted with respect to tariffs, might be possible to incorporate into the bill.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.Mr. Speaker, despite the subject matter, which I am sure the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] has explicated very clearly, this is in fact a happy day. That is to say that with the passage of the bill today, the Senate bill, S. 813, we will have addressed a very, very serious matter in a timely fashion, which is to say that the President will have the opportunity, hopefully, to sign this bill, perhaps as early as Veterans Day, upcoming Veterans Day.Mr. Speaker, I rise today then to urge my colleagues to support passage of S. 813, the Veterans Cemetery Protection Act, as amended by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. The gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] and I first introduced this bill in the House, and I am happy that we were able to work with the Senate to bring their version to the floor today for passage.As I indicated, it is appropriate that we are able to take up this bill as Veterans Day approaches. This bill instructs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to significantly increase criminal penalties for theft and willful vandalism at national cemeteries.First, Mr. Speaker, I would like to take some time to thank the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert], who gave me the opportunity to work with him on this requisite piece of legislation. It has indeed been a pleasure to work with him, and I am pleased that together we have been successful in our effort to move this bill through Congress.I might say as well, Mr. Speaker, that I have had an opportunity to work with the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] as the ranking member on his subcommittee and the Committee on Resources previous to this, and it has been an extraordinarily enjoyable time for me, legislatively and personally, to be associated with him.I would also like to sincerely thank the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Stump] and the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde] for recognizing the need for this legislation and for working with us, the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] and myself, and giving us their support in moving this issue forward. The gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] has been extraordinarily patient in this endeavor, and I very much appreciate it.I would likewise like to thank the gentleman from Florida [Mr. McCollum], who has also made a significant contribution to this bill, and I would like to extend my personal gratitude to him. I have had the opportunity to work with him in other areas as well, juvenile justice for one. And I appreciate the opportunity to extend to him my personal congratulations in helping to get this forward and extend to him my personal thanks.On April 19, 1997, Mr. Speaker, seven Oahu cemeteries on the Island of Oahu in the State of Hawaii, including the National Cemetery of the Pacific at Punchbowl and the Hawaii Veterans Cemetery, were vandalized. Vandals used red spray paint to write racist and profane words on grave markers and cemetery and chapel walls. It is obvious that nothing is, in fact, sacred to the people who committed this act. Strict penalties must be enacted to send the message that we will not allow this type of behavior to continue unchecked.As we have heard from the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert], this was not the only desecration of a national cemetery to occur in the country. Unfortunately, this type of crime is on the rise. On May 18, 1997, the New Jersey National Cemetery was also vandalized just prior to Memorial Day. These acts are an insult to the veterans who gave their lives to ensure our freedoms and to their families. Further, it is an affront to all men and women who have served or are presently serving in our Nation's Armed Forces.I regret to say, Mr. Speaker, but it is entirely a propos that, unfortunately, just yesterday, and I arrived a little too late to know whether the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] entered this into the Record, but there was a Scripps Howard News Service story just yesterday, ``Vandalism Rising At Veterans Cemeteries.'' Coincidental, Mr. Speaker, of course, to the passage of the bill today, but very pertinent in terms of asking the Members to support it. The story says, in part, ``Lawmakers hope President Clinton will sign the bill into law on Veterans Day, on Tuesday.''I want to indicate that under the sentencing guidelines which I mentioned, in case it has not been made a part of the Record, it gives guidelines to the judges, directing them to increase the penalties for convictions of theft and vandalism at the national cemeteries. The measure before us would set prison terms for up to 10 years for anyone convicted of vandalism causing more that $1,000 damage and up to 15 years for thefts at the national cemeteries.I would like to conclude, Mr. Speaker, by indicating that today we are voting to send that message that we will not forget the sacrifices made by those who made the ultimate sacrifice and that we will not tolerate further desecration of our Nation's cemeteries.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the bill to extend the Native American Veterans Housing Loan Program and for other purposes.In July I introduced H.R. 2317, the House companion bill to S. 714. I am pleased that we are able to take up the Senate's version today. I would like to thank the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Stump] and the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Evans] and the staff of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for working hard to strike the compromise which made it possible to take up this bill on the floor today. I would especially like to thank Debra Wada of Senator Akaka's staff and Jill Cochran of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for their hard work on improving benefits for native American veterans.In 1992, the Native American Veterans' Home Loan Equity Act was enacted to establish and implement a pilot program to make direct housing loans to aid native American, Indian, Alaska or Hawaii Native or Pacific islander, veterans in purchasing, constructing, or improving dwellings on trust lands.The Department of Veterans Affairs has successfully entered into agreements to provide direct loans to members of 46 Indian tribes and Pacific island groups. The VA is in negotiation with hundreds of other tribes to establish memorandums of understanding which would make this program available to those tribes. It is important that we extend this program to allow those native American tribes who are still in negotiations with the VA to have a chance to apply for these loans.Through June of 1997, 164 loans were made to both Pacific islanders and native American veterans, with 90 applications pending. To date none of those loans issued has been foreclosed. This is an extremely successful program and is the only program available for this group of veterans who live on trust lands to finance homes for their families. The Department of Veterans Affairs supports the extension of this program.Therefore, Mr. Speaker, the main issue here is equity. Native American veterans have a right to the same benefits available to other veterans. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.",

    "title": "VISA WAIVER PILOT PROGRAM",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report on H.R. 2267, the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill.One of the provisions included in the bill is a 6-month extension of the State Department's Visa Waiver Pilot Program [VWPP]. This is the mechanism by which our country allows visitors from approximately 26 nations to enter the United States without visas. Passports are sufficient for entry.And this is a good program. Obtaining visas is a time-consuming endeavor, from applications, screening, approval, and to issuance. We do not need to require visas of every visitor from abroad, and the Visa Waiver Pilot Program has been a tremendous success for years in expediting foreign visitors, whether for employment, tourism, family, or business purposes.I have been working closely with Congressmen Barney Frank, Jay Kim, and others with the leadership of the Immigration and Claims Subcommittee, particularly Chairman Lamar Smith and ranking Democrat Mel Watt, to resolve a problem--specifically whether Portugal and the Republic of Korea should be included in the visa waiver program. They have exerted tremendous time and energy and effort to identify and resolve problems in the program and we are committed to working together in the months ahead to adjust the program so that citizens of these countries can travel to the United States with only a passport.Mr. Speaker, during the hearings and committee consideration of the visa waiver program, concerns were raised by some Members and the State and Justice Departments. I do not believe those concerns are insurmountable, and we are working with those agencies to address security and other concerns. We all feel that the current waiver criteria should be reformed, and I will be working in the months ahead with my colleagues to craft a visa waiver system that expands visitor opportunities.As you know, tourism is the dominant industry in Hawaii, and it is crucially important that we have a visa waiver system for tourists that allows a maximum number of visitors to enter the United States. Thousands of Hawaiian families and individuals are dependent on tourism and on the number of visitors using hotels, restaurants, transportation facilities, and retail businesses. A strong case has been made that citizens of Korea, one of our strongest allies in the world, should be given the waiver consideration that we have afforded 26 other nations.The 6 months extension of the existing Visa Waiver Pilot Program is a prudent decision, and reflects a good-faith effort being made to address constructively the issues facing the future of the program. I look forward to working with Chairman Smith, the members of the House Judiciary Committee, and those seeking an expansion of the program to develop an effective and workable program addressing all concerns.",

    "title": "THE HAWAII FEDERAL MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PERCENTAGE ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 1998",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce legislation to adjust the Federal medical assistance percentage [FMAP] rate for Hawaii to more fairly reflect the state's ability to bear its share of Medicaid payments. I am pleased that my colleague, Representative Patsy Mink, has joined me as a sponsor of this measure. I am also happy to join our Senate counterparts, Senator Daniel Akaka and Senator Daniel Inouye, in putting forth this legislation. In November 1997, a similar bill, S. 1376 was introduced by Senator Akaka.The Federal share of Medicaid payments for each state varies according to the state's ability to pay. Because per capita income is the determining factor for ability to pay, wealthier state bear a larger share of the cost of the program through lower FMAP rates. In Hawaii, per capita income is relatively high. Thus, the State's FMAP rate is 50 percent, the lowest level. Under this bill, Hawaii's FMAP rate would be increased from 50 percent to 59.8 percent.The rationale for the FMAP rate change is quite simple. Hawaii's high cost of living skews the per capita income determining factor. Based on 1995 United States Census data, the cost of living in Honolulu is 83 percent higher than the average of the metropolitan areas. More recent studies have shown that for the state as a whole, the cost of living is more than one-third higher than the rest of the United States. In fact, Hawaii's Cost of Living Index ranks it as the highest in the country. Some government programs take the high cost of living in Hawaii into account and funding is adjusted accordingly. These programs include Medicare prospective payment rates, food stamp allocations, school lunch programs, housing insurance limits, Federal employee salaries, and military living expenses. These examples show a Federal recognition that the higher cost of living in noncontiguous states should be taken into account in fashioning government program policies. It is time for similar recognition of this factor in gaging Hawaii's ability to support its health care programs.An excellent analysis of this issue is included in the twenty-first edition of ``The Federal Budget and the States,'' a joint study conducted by the Taubman Center and Local Government at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government and the office of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. According to the study, if per capita income is measured in real terms, the State of Hawaii ranks 47th at $19,755 compared to the national average of $24,231. Thus, Hawaii's 50 percent FMAP rate is understated because cost of living factors are not considered. Per capita income is a poor measure of Hawaii's relative ability to bear the cost of Medicaid services.In addition to the high cost of living, the Harvard-Moynihan study finds that Hawaii also has one of the highest poverty rates in the nation. The state's 16.9 percent poverty rate is ranked eighth in the country, compared to the national average of 14.7 percent. These higher cost levels are reflected in state government expenditures and state taxation. On a per capita basis, state revenue and expenditures are far higher in Hawaii, as well as Alaska, than in the 48 mainland states. The higher expenditure levels are necessary to assure an adequate level of public services which are more costly to provide in our states. Of the top 10 states with the highest poverty rates in the country, the Harvard-Moynihan study finds that only 3 others have an FMAP rate between 50 and 60 percent. The other six states have FMAP rates of 65 percent and higher. Even more revealing is that of the top 10 states with the lowest real per capita income, only Hawaii has a 50 percent FMAP rate.During consideration of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Senate included a provision increasing Alaska's FMAP rate to 59.8 percent for the next 3 years. Setting a higher match rate as was done for Alaska would still leave Hawaii with a lower FMAP rate than a majority of the states, but would better recognize Hawaii's ability to pay its fair share of the costs of the Medicaid program.I hope to make my colleagues in the House of Representative colleagues cognizant of the need for this legislation and to earn their support for its passage in the 105th Congress.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I too rise in strong support of the bill. S. 927 provides a strong reauthorization of the National Sea Grant College Program which, for over 30 years, has addressed important local, regional and national marine resource problems through education, research and public outreach.The legislation before the House is a compromise with the other body. It reauthorizes Sea Grant for 5 years. It clarifies the roles of the national office and the Sea Grant colleges. It strengthens competitive peer review for grants and contracts for research, education and outreach, and generally brings Sea Grant up to date as a modern education and research program.The authorization levels in the bill will fully fund Sea Grant's ongoing base program, while providing additional funding for certain research priorities, which include nonindigenous species, oyster disease, and toxic microbe Pfiesteria.While I do not question the validity of research in these areas, I regret that some Members have felt it necessary to question whether all of these research options are necessary. One of the sea grant's great strengths over the years has been its ability to respond rapidly and effectively to local and regional needs, Mr. Speaker. I think that that is something that is now involved in the program in a way that both the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton) and myself can support. There is no reason to think that it will not continue to do so; that is to say, respond effectively to local needs under its usual effective peer review processes.I would like to express my appreciation for the cooperation that we in the minority have received from the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton) and the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) and the staffs on this bill.I can assure my colleagues that on this bill any partisan considerations were put to rest with respect to the thrust of the legislative activity under consideration. This is not, therefore, a bipartisan bill, this is a nonpartisan bill. I think all of us who represent coastal areas have long appreciated the benefits of this practical and noncontroversial program. It is a good bill, reauthorizing a popular program. I am glad we are doing it at this time. I most certainly urge the House to support this legislation.Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).(Mr. GREEN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)",

I am looking at the gentleman from California (Mr. Miller) right now who is smiling at me, and trying to get over the hush that came over the crowd as someone moves to this side. I am looking for the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), my very able chairman.I point that out because this is a nonpartisan issue and is being cast, I am very sorry to say, in somewhat partisan terms, not necessarily by party but partisan terms, as if there is a right side and a wrong side. As the gentleman from Puerto Rico (Mr. Romero- Barcelo) has indicated, as the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton) has indicated, as the gentleman from California (Mr. Miller) has indicated, and the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), what we are trying to do here today is to aid and assist, as Members of the House of Representatives, the self-determination of fellow citizens.The gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton) has been adamant on this. I do not think we are going to find a more partisan person in the House with respect to the question of English and its being used as common language throughout the United States. But that issue will be debated in another venue, at another time.What we are talking about here is something that I ask Members, as a representative from the last State to come into the Union. We have only been a State for 38 years. We have been a State for less years than many people in this body have been alive and serving in public office.So it is very, very particularly poignant in some respects to me today to stand here as someone who was not born in Hawaii and has the privilege to serve in Hawaii.I was born in the east of the United States, in Buffalo, New York, in the area represented by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Paxon) today. It never occurred to me that one day I would have the privilege and honor of standing in the well of this House to serve the people not only of Hawaii, but of the United States of America.That will happen in Puerto Rico. We cannot determine ahead of time what is going to happen there. The conventional wisdom, as some will recall, when Hawaii and Alaska came into the Union, was that Hawaii would be a Republican State, and, indeed, we elected a Republican Governor in our very first State election, and that Alaska would be a democratic State.As you know, that has worked differently. We have had Republican office holders here, we have had Democratic office holders here. This is not a partisan issue.Mr. Chairman, I appeal to my Republican friends, please, take into account that our fellow citizens are merely asking for the opportunity to determine their future.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak against this bill, and reluctantly because of my friendship and high regard for the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), which I think goes without saying, as well as my regard for the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Gejdenson).Nonetheless, I feel, Mr. Speaker, that it is imperative that everyone recognize, as has been indicated by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) our ranking member on the Committee on National Security, that this particular purchase has not come through the procedures and hearings in National Security. I believe we should properly have jurisdiction in this regard.We are criticized constantly for having a defense budget that is not adequate, or we are criticized for the transfer of technology for profit as opposed to actually meeting the defense interest of this country, and I most certainly understand the idea that we have to defend ourselves against drugs. But in this instance we have advanced navigational and plotting systems associated with the Blackhawk that I believe may very well fall into the category of transfer of technology which many members of the Committee on National Security on a bipartisan basis oppose.Now, I believe that we will be taking funds away from Peru and Bolivia. Whether that is true or not, I am not exactly certain because we have not had the hearings on it. Colombia, as has been well stated, already has a minimum capacity apparently at the present time to deal with the Black Hawk program. Yet, I understand that Colombia is cutting its defense budget.Now, if we are to form that budget forum, I think that we need to make that part of the dialogue that takes place in the Committee on National Security. Black Hawks are used by our frontline troops. The administration, I understand, is indicating that it will propose super Huey helicopters that are adequate for the drug missions, that can be utilized for night vision, for example, and that the situation now about insurgency requires that we take very, very careful notice of whether or not the military utilizing these helicopters would be people who are actually going to take up the cause against drug trafficking. The corruption factor, aside from those who are heroically trying to pursue it right now within the Colombian military, is a very real question that needs to be answered.Now, we have already had arguments on this floor or discussion on this floor today about the capabilities of the Black Hawk versus the Huey helicopter, the survivability of the Black Hawks versus the Huey helicopter. That is the proper jurisdiction and purview of the Committee on National Security. I think that we need to take it up in that context.My understanding is, as well, that the administration is claiming, as has been asserted elsewhere, that we will be taking away from the budget allotted to counternarcotics programs elsewhere in Latin and South America.Now, Mr. Speaker, that may be the case, or it may not. I am not entirely certain. But I do know this, that in order for us to proceed on these matters, I implore my colleagues, please make these kinds of things a matter of joint jurisdiction with the Committee on National Security which sets the policy here. I think there is a fundamental point not just of procedure in the House, but of acting in the best interests of the security interests of the United States by asking that this be done.If we are going to simply move to the appropriations committees and have the appropriations committees make these decisions with respect to expenditures, how are we supposed to put together a rational national defense policy in coordination with the international relations aspect that we need to sustain and maintain?I think, Mr. Speaker, that the distinguished chairman, and I mean that in every sense, that is not a pro forma utilization of the word by me. The distinguished chairman of the Committee on International Relations would agree that those of us who are on the national security side of policy have worked with him in the past and in every instance where he has requested it. He knows that not only myself, but every member of the Committee on National Security would be willing to work with him in any instance where the international relations and national security interests of this country are at stake.On that basis, I would appeal, then, to the chairman of the Committee on International Relations to recognize that our interest is legitimate and that we want to work very closely with him to have a resolution of this matter that would be in the interest of everyone, Colombians and the people of the United States alike.",

    "title": "CREDIT UNION MEMBERSHIP ACCESS ACT",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Access Act, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the bill today.Development of this bill is the product of long and hard work, not only by the House Committee on Banking which has brought the bill to the House floor, but by millions of individual members of credit unions across the country who let Congress know of the importance of the Supreme Court decision on this matter earlier, and of the need to move H.R. 1511 as a result of that decision.The legislation we are considering today is a compromise that ends a dispute largely between credit unions and the nation's banks. Federal regulators had interpreted federal law to allow multiple common bond memberships, and one result was a rapid increase in credit union membership. The increase in credit union membership came at a time when there was an expansion in the scope and type of services they had traditionally provided members, resulting in competition with commercial banks, thrift institutions and other financial services. Congress is now in the process of redefining the nature of all financial institutions so it is timely that we make a specific decision on the nature and scope of credit unions and the services they provide. And I believe enactment is H.R. 1151 is essential for competition with the new types of financial institutions now becoming a reality with the distinctions ending between banks, insurance firms, securities and commercial businesses. This bill is about making sure consumers have a choice, today and in the future.With a population of 1.3 million people, Hawaii has more than 550,000 credit union members in 113 affiliated credit unions. Hawaii's traditional cultural values have resulted in one of the strongest credit union movements in America. Many first generation immigrants brought with them a system called tanomoshi. Workers and families in sugar cane and pineapple plantations in Hawaii pooled savings from which loans were provided for emergencies or more often for one family to start a business. When the business prospered, the funds would be repaid to the group and it would revolve to another family. In this way, much of the business, middle class in Hawaii developed from its plantation agriculture economy. The reality is that we had credit unions in Hawaii long before the mainland. It was simply called tanomoshi instead of credit unions. This is a grass-roots democratic movement built on the foundation of self-help and group identity.H.R. 1151 allows current credit union members to continue their membership. New membership groups must have less than 3,000 common bond members at the time of joining, and groups will be within reasonable proximity to the credit union. However, there are circumstances when even these restrictions can be waived. It is important to credit union members as well as to their competitors that depositor insurance provisions be strengthened under the bill. It would also require that ``persons of modest means'' within each credit union membership field be served.Mr. Speaker, I believe H.R. 1151 is a solid, reasonable and responsible compromise. We must have a healthy and vigorous credit union movement in the 21st Century to meet the needs of individuals as well as the need of the nation for a diverse, competitive financial industry.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Illegal Foreign Contributions Act, H.R. 34.This bill, if enacted, would ban contributions to federal election campaigns by legal permanent residents. I believe this would be a colossal mistake and a constitutional blunder. This bill would restrict the First Amendment free speech rights of Legal Permanent Residents. These residents are required to perform citizenship obligations, such as registering for the military draft and serving in the armed forces, but we would deny them the basic citizenship rights we require them to defend.Consistently throughout federal constitutional law, Legal Permanent Residents have all First Amendment freedoms of full U.S. citizens. This has been consistently upheld by the federal courts and the Supreme Court. H.R. 34 would deliberately abridge and deny those rights in the name of campaigning finance reform. It would trample on the constitutional rights of hundreds of thousands of people without justification. The bill picks out a specific group of people and says we are going to prevent you from expressing your political views.This bill is a gag of political expression in the disguise of campaign reform. The reality is that hard-working, tax-paying, military-serving individuals are being told they can have no say over who is elected to determine the policies that determines their fates and lives.Mr. Speaker, I also fear that legislation that singles out specific groups of people for treatment different than that of citizens will lead us down a road to finding scapegoats when there are failings in our government and society. This is a dangerous precedent, and I urge my colleagues to think carefully before they cast their vote on H.R. 34, and to vote against this ill-conceived ``reform''.",

    "title": "MAIL FRAUD AND TELEMARKETING SCAMS TARGETING SENIOR CITIZENS",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call my colleagues' attention to a serious crime being perpetrated against some of our most vulnerable citizens: mail fraud and telemarketing scams targeting senior citizens. In my own district, one gentleman pleaded with me, ``The mail is still coming. I don't have the money to send.''Some companies peddling questionable products or promoting unwinnable contests make a living out of targeting senior citizens. It is estimated that telemarketing fraud robs Americans of at least $40 billion a year.The actual number may be much higher, as telemarketing fraud has always been a part of our Nation's underground economy. Not all losses have been clearly documented. Some consumers are too embarrassed to report that they have been defrauded or they do not recognize the extent of the fraud that has been perpetrated upon them.Mr. Speaker, I held a meeting on this issue in my district recently; and I was appalled at the number of people in the audience who came up to me after a discussion led by members of the FBI, led by members of the Post Office, the Postal Inspector Section, after the recitation of statistics and perspective by myself, and yet asked me afterwards if I could give them my personal assistance in contacting some of the fraudulent companies to see if it was not possible for them to perhaps receive their prizes or be acknowledged for the funds that they had been sending.Mr. Speaker, I can assure my colleagues that this is a heart-wrenching situation. It is taking place all over the country, and it prompts me to rise today to extend these remarks to my colleague and to the other Members.Older Americans, Mr. Speaker, are the target of many fraudulent telemarketers because they are generally at home more often than younger persons, they may be more trusting. That is certainly the case with those that I spoke with recently in Honolulu, Mr. Speaker, and may look upon a smooth-talking telemarketer as a trusted friend rather than someone preying upon their life savings. These fraudulent activities are a disgrace, and we should do all we can to stop them.On April 8, 1998, as I indicated, I sponsored a mail and telemarketing fraud briefing for senior citizens in my district in Honolulu, Hawaii. This education national briefing was designed to give vulnerable senior citizens a fighting chance against an industry designed to victimize them.John Gillis, a supervisory special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Honolulu, and Byron Dare, a postal inspector for the United States Postal Service in Honolulu, presented testimony on their agencies' efforts to combat mail and telemarketing fraud and educated seniors on how to avoid becoming victims of such schemes.Mr. Speaker, I most sincerely urge my colleague and other Members to take advantage of FBI offices in our districts, as well as postal service inspectors in our district, to hold similar briefings for senior citizens in our areas. Senior citizens need to be protected from these scam artists, and one of the best ways to do this is educate them on how fraudulent information is presented.I am preparing legislation on this issue. I am already a cosponsor of the Protection against Scams on Seniors Act, H.R. 3134. This bill authorizes the Administration on Aging to conduct an outreach program to educate seniors on telemarketing fraud. I plan to continue my outreach efforts to reach Hawaii's elderly population from falling prey to these unscrupulous mail and telemarketers.I also support the efforts of Federal agencies and private organizations who have been actively involved in this issue. The American Association of Retired Persons, the AARP, has created a profile of telemarketing and mail fraud victims. The profile shows the average victim is not only an older American, but relatively affluent, well-educated, well-informed, and socially active in his or her community.AARP's research indicates that the critical difference between victims and nonvictims is their ability to recognize that telemarketing fraud is a crime. Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize that. The key here, the critical difference between being a victim and a nonvictim is their ability to recognize that telemarketing fraud is a crime.Many people find themselves the victim of fraud and do not recognize that it is, in fact, criminal activity, and there is something they can do about it. AARP has produced educational materials in English and Spanish. If seniors would contact the AARP in their area, they will be happy to provide them with materials, telephone numbers, et cetera, which will aid them.The AARP has produced educational materials in English and Spanish that inform recipients of telemarketing calls about ways to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent calls; how to respond safely to calls without becoming a victim; and how to report suspicious calls. I am making sure this material is available in all the senior centers in Honolulu.In Hawaii, state laws on telemarketing require specific disclosures by the telemarketer regarding prize and gift promotions. Our state law also provides consumers with a right to sue for damages and obtain relief on his or her own initiative, aside from any state action. Maximum penalties for a violation of Hawaii's telemarketing laws are set at $10,000.Uncovering these schemes, returning money owed to its victims, and educating seniors are worthwhile efforts I will continue to pursue. I am happy to have the support and knowledge of many organizations who also promote these goals. I will continue to educate senior citizens in my district of this $40 billion rip-off. I hope my fellow Members of Congress will do the same. With a concerted effort, we can protect our senior citizens and put mail and telemarketing con-artists out of business.",

    "title": "FUNDING FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I call on both the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House to pass the $18 billion International Monetary Fund as soon as possible. It is urgent for Hawaii's citizens, workers, and the businesses that I represent.In early winter 1997, economies in South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia collapsed. The effects on Hawaii have stifled recovery from the deepest recession the State has experienced in 50 years.Problems began when the Japanese economy faltered in 1991. Tourism and direct foreign investment plunged. Devaluation of the yen and now other Asian currencies have resulted in the Hawaii recession.Unemployment is at 6.5 percent. And by the way, Mr. Speaker, the 6.5 percent may not seem very high to some others in the country who have experienced much greater percentages in times past, but for Hawaii that is a very, very high number.Tourism last month dropped 14 percent from March a year ago. Costs for the Japanese tourist or businessperson are more than 50 percent higher than they were in 1991. Investment decline has resulted in construction contract receipts falling 40 percent since 1991. Business and individual bankruptcy are at record high levels.Business, labor, industry, and government in Hawaii are working on solutions but cannot provide direct economic aid to Asian countries or restructure Asian economies. Only Congress can and must do that in conjunction with the IMF.Current funding proposals have been derailed over unrelated issues, such as abortion. There are adequate vehicles for dealing with those issues, and the leadership should drop them and bring an IMF bill to the House floor immediately.Economists indicate it will take 1 to 3 years for Asian economies to recover, even with IMF aid. Although there is no quick fix, we must start now, because Hawaii and the U.S. economies are being damaged by inaction. And I stress the U.S. economy in general as well as that of Hawaii in particular, Mr. Speaker.Knowing the relationship between IMF and America's foreign trade, which includes tourism and the movement of investment capital, President Clinton recently said that IMF funding was something ``we owe to the future of this country and to our children.'' That certainly applies to Hawaii.That is why I wrote today to the Speaker and Democratic leader, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Gephardt) urging immediate action. I have the letter here, Mr. Speaker, and I will submit it as part of my remarks.Threat of economic destabilization remains, and delay is only intensifying the problem. The IMF must be allowed to do its job, including helping restructure the economic systems in Asia which resulted in the need for the multibillion-dollar bailout. But the IMF cannot do its job without the funding necessary to stabilize these economies.Mr. Speaker, we must not put America's economic well-being at risk by ignoring the Asian financial crisis. We must not put Hawaii's economic well-being at risk by ignoring the Asian financial crisis. I urge that the IMF bill, the International Monetary Fund bill, be brought to the House floor immediately.Mr. Speaker, the letter I earlier referred to is as follows: Neil Abercrombie,Dear Mr. Speaker: On behalf of the people of Hawaii who have been suffering through the toughest economic times in more than half a century, I urge that the funding bill be brought to the House floor expeditiously. I am deeply concerned about the failure of the House of Representatives to act on the $18 billion in emergency funding for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to deal with the Asian financial crisis. As you may know, during the last quarter of 1997, a financial crisis swept through several Asian countries. In response, the IMF came up with proposals to strengthen the economies of Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia and, in the process, reduce the threat of destabilization to the rest of Asia and the Pacific Rim. In this regard, it is vital that Congress provide the IMF with the necessary resources to adequately deal with the Asian financial crisis. Failure to enact IMF funding potentially jeopardizes our nation's ability to sustain economic growth. In Hawaii, the effects are more immediate. The Asian financial crisis, combined with the problems of the Japanese economy, has already had a negative economic impact on the state. Continued neglect by Congress will exacerbate this situation and make it more difficult for Hawaii to deal with its greatest economic challenge since statehood. Since 1991, Hawaii's economy has been stagnant. Since that time, the bankruptcy rate has skyrocketed and our unemployment rate has grown and now ranks among the highest in the nation. The primary reason for Hawaii's economic problems can be attributed to the decline in travel and tourism from Japan and other Asian countries as well as the consequences of direct foreign capital being withdrawn from investment in the state. In March, the number of visitors to Hawaii was down by 40,000 compared to the same time last year. The most dramatic loss was in the number of East-bound visitors from Asia which declined 14 per cent. Equally profound is the impact of the Yen currency devaluation. Today, it costs a Japanese tourist or businessperson 50 percent more to stay in Hawaii than it did in 1991. No sector of Hawaii's economy has been left untouched. Take for instance the construction industry; contract receipts for construction fell in 1997 to $2.9 billion, down from $3.2 billion in 1996, continuing into a 40 percent decline since 1991. Emergency funding for the IMF will not provide a quick fix to the Asian financial crisis. The situation in Asia developed over decades and economists have indicated that the IMF-supervised policy adjustments will take one to three years before they take hold. Yet, passage of the $18 billion in emergency financing for the IMF funding is a necessary step in resolving the crisis. I fear that inaction by Congress will only intensify the problem. I understand there are many members of Congress who hold strong views on issues which have become inextricably and unfairly linked to the IMF funding bill. Congress has many legislative vehicles with which to deliberate issues such as the abortion policies of other nations. Holding the IMF funding hostage to unrelated issues is not fair and runs counterproductive to the efforts of all sectors of Hawaii society--business, industry, labor and government--to resolve our economic problems. Although there are steps that all of those parties can and are taking, it is far beyond their authority to address the need to restructure economies of Asian countries. That is the proper role for the IMF, Congress, and the federal government. I strongly urge that you and the other members of the Republican leadership take immediate steps to resolve the emergency funding issues for the IMF. We should not put the well-being of our nation's economy at risk by ignoring the Asian financial crisis. Emergency funding for the IMF cannot be held captive to unrelated issues.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding to me. I am delighted to have the opportunity to be here with my colleagues on the Committee on National Security, most particularly with the chairman of our Subcommittee on Military Research and Development, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon).As the gentleman has indicated, our efforts here on the committee and the subcommittees which makes it up are of a bipartisan nature. It has been my honor and privilege over the years to serve under Mr. Aspin and Mr. Dellums and now the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spence). During that time, I think that we have grown in our respect for one another and certainly I want to acknowledge the commitment that has been made by all of the Members, regardless of their party and background, to the security interests of this Nation.Mr. Speaker, there is a popular fashion in political circles these days with respect to the idea of limited service in the Congress. That, I suppose, has its place in the discussions that ensue throughout the Nation as to how we can best serve our country and our national interests. But I can assure my colleagues that with respect to our national security interests and the defense interests of this country, what is required is a commitment and a dedication of years, I might even say decades standing, in order to be able to provide the broadest possible umbrella of knowledge and perspective as we come to these very crucial decisions by our Nation as we enter the next century.Mr. Speaker, I dare say, not speaking for Chairman Spence by any stretch of the imagination, that in his 28 years of service here to the Nation and service to our committee, that even today he feels there is much to be learned, much that we have to share with one another in order to come to a proper perspective. And why? The reason is that we do in fact have 435 votes in this House, 218 votes to make a majority. Those who say that votes do not count, those who say that this is just business as usual, those who denigrate the Congress of the United States, let alone the House, and more particularly those who do not understand that when it comes to the security interests of this Nation, that we have to have knowledgeable, dedicated people who are on a nonpartisan basis going to pursue what those interests are and how to achieve them. If we do not have that understanding, then we are doing a disservice to this Nation.Now, for the record, I would like to indicate that the Committee on National Security approximates, I would say, approximately 10 percent of the House of Representatives and I think represents a very broad perspective, probably reflecting the ideological and philosophical commitments of the House of Representatives as a whole.In that context what we have is individuals assigned to committees who then make it their business to immerse themselves into the business of that committee. I am going to focus this evening just particularly on the subcommittee on which I am privileged to serve under the chairmanship of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon). That is the Subcommittee on Military Research and Development.Now, on the surface it sounds pretty simple. We do the research and then we develop from that research. But let me just read a summary of today's action that was taken in committee, a summary of the bill language: Navy mine countermeasures program management; future aircraft carrier transition technologies; the manufacturing technology program; national missile defense policy; limitation on the funding of medium extended air defense systems, the MEAD system that the gentleman referred to; funding for the cooperative ballistic missile defense programs; the counterproliferation support; and the ballistic missile program elements.Mr. Speaker, I can say these things and they roll off of my tongue and my colleagues are familiar with what they mean. But the implications of this are stunning in terms of the dollar value and, of course, in terms of the strategic value associated with the national interests of this Nation and in fact the security interests of the world.The gentleman from Pennsylvania, who I would venture to say, I think without contradiction, is the leading exponent and expert, certainly congressional expert, with respect to missile defense, someone who I might say is always prepared, would agree that unless and until we are prepared just in one context that I will mention alone, unless we are prepared to deal with missile testing as well as training associated with the weapons systems that we are acquiring, the weapons systems we are researching, the weapons systems we are developing, unless we are prepared to deal with the missile testing element in that, we will not be prepared to move forward in meeting our strategic national interests. We will be unprepared.Now, it sounds strange. How can we possibly not be prepared with billions of dollars at stake, with years and years of research, with all kinds of development capabilities, major corporations, in fact international corporations the size of which will almost beggar the imagination of the ordinary citizen contemplating them, how could we not possibly be prepared? The reason is that the technology involved just in the recitation of some of the program elements that I have just outlined, the technology involved is so expensive, the technology involved is so complicated and detailed, the sophistication, Mr. Speaker, is almost beyond comprehension.I just recently visited the Comanche helicopter development facility in Florida, and asked just to have a briefing, Mr. Speaker, on the capacity of the helicopter not to have information intercepted, on being able to have the communications system, a highly sophisticated system, not be compromised in any way. This is very, very important, Mr. Speaker, because if we do not have this, if there is not a clear understanding of what the technology is and how we can protect the communications interests associated with the Comanche helicopter, it becomes available to those who could do us harm or wish us ill in the future.Mr. Speaker, we have to deal with questions of technology transfer. As the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) and the gentleman from South Carolina (Chairman Spence) know, I am, shall we say, an adamant opponent of the transfer of technology for profit's sake, presumed profit's sake, maybe individual dollar profits for some corporations and individuals, but certainly not for the profit of the interests of the United States. I oppose that.Mr. Speaker, the dollars that have been spent and the time and the energy and the intellectual input that has gone into just the communication system of the Comanche helicopter system is such that a full appreciation for the work of the committee I think would follow from any honest person's evaluation of what we are trying to accomplish.So as we contemplate research and development, I think that we have to take into account, Mr. Speaker, how are we going to do the funding? How are we going to achieve this?What is happening right now, and if the gentleman from Pennsylvania would care to engage in a bit of dialogue with me on it at this point, I think can elucidate this a little and illustrate it. Mr. Speaker, I realize the time is short so I will try to make this a summation.In my service on the committee, in trying to deal with issues, for example, like missile testing, the assumption I think of most Americans is that there is an adequate missile defense right now to meet any challenge that might come to the United States. But the fact are that those systems do not yet exist?",

We will hurt the capacity of the individuals and the groups who make up our Armed Services to be able to prepare themselves for the contingencies that they might face, and that in fact is where we find ourselves today.So I want to conclude, Mr. Speaker, thanking the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Chairman Weldon) and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spence) for the opportunity to participate with them and indicate as a member of the Subcommittee on Military Installations and Facilities and the Subcommittee on Military Research and Development, that I recognize fully the necessity of finding the proper funding mechanism and the proper funding balance in order to provide a defense that we can say with full confidence to the American people we will be able to provide for the security interests of this Nation.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I have in my hand the Asian American and Pacific Islander Journal of Health here from the autumn issue in 1993. It addresses the health status of Kanaka Maoli, the indigenous Hawaiians. It is written by my good friend Dr. Richard Kekuni Blaisdell.In the process of reviewing this, Mr. Speaker, you will find that the purpose is to summarize the current health status of the Kanaka Maoli, the indigenous Hawaiian people, with historical background, the underlying factors responsible for the indigenous Hawaiian health plight and recommendations.The principal findings, Mr. Speaker, are that the indigenous Hawaiians continue to have the worst health and socioeconomic indicators of the various ethnic groups who call their home Hawaii: cardiovascular disorders, cancer, diabetes, obstructive lung diseases, maternal and infant ill health, alcohol problems, obesity, major life-style risk factors, societal factors such as depopulation, foreign transmigration, colonial exploitation, cultural conflict and racism.Since 1990, Mr. Speaker, as a result of our native Hawaiian health programs funded here in the Congress and under our auspices, native Hawaiian communities have established five island-wide native Hawaiian health care systems to improve availability, accessibility, and acceptability of health services to all of the indigenous Hawaiian people, to provide them with resources.The health status is a grim one, Mr. Speaker, and I have to bring to your attention and to the rest of my colleagues the important matters which we have been addressing by congressional action and are now compromised.The House Committee on the Budget yesterday released a proposed budget for the Federal Government for the coming year. Mr. Speaker, I am saddened, not just outraged, but saddened by the effort contained in that proposal to eliminate funding for the native Hawaiian health care programs. Why the leadership of the Committee on the Budget and the leadership, Mr. Speaker, in the majority Republican Conference, has chosen to attack native Hawaiian health courtrooms is beyond me.The program addresses the documented needs of Hawaii's native citizens in a culturally relevant context. Of all of the races of people in the islands of Hawaii, the native Hawaiian people have had the most difficult times in health and social indicators. Why it is a position of the Republican majority to attack native Hawaiians is beyond my grasp at this time, Mr. Speaker.They are hurting people in the lowest socioeconomic status with the highest overall mortality rate, the highest cancer mortality rate, the highest accident rate, the highest years of productive life lost to chronic disease, the highest infant mortality rate. I could go on with this, Mr. Speaker. It is a litany that we are trying to overcome.These grim statistics can be attributed to the imposition of foreign cultures and practices upon the native Hawaiian people. Only since the 1988 introduction of the native Hawaiian health program have we begun to turn these statistics around. We need the budget for it, and we have achieved a balanced Federal budget in the process. I voted consistently to achieve that goal.Mr. Speaker, I will end my remarks now, but will put forward the statistics as well as the background on the proposal to end these programs for native Hawaiians by the majority. I hope, Mr. Speaker, by the time we finish our budget proposal that we will be able to reverse this proposal.",

    "title": "``MY VOICE IN OUR DEMOCRACY''",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend Zachary Hicks, a student at Hawaii Baptist Academy in Honolulu, who recently won the 1998 Voice of Democracy broadcast scriptwriting contest for Hawaii.Each year, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and its Ladies Auxiliary sponsor the Voice of Democracy contest to recognize writing and oratorical skills of students. Zachary Hicks related the democracy demonstrations of Tianamen Square in the People's Republic of China to the freedoms to enjoy and the need to exercise freedom of speech.I would like to share the script with the House and America, Mr. Speaker, which I am submitting. I am certain Leon and Brenda Hicks, Zac's parents, as well as his teachers and fellow students at Hawaii Baptist Academy, have great pride in Zac and his accomplishment.Not long ago, a number of young men and women broke out in protest of a government they did not believe in. With fear overpowered by conviction, these students stared communism in the face and said, ``We will no longer be shut up, pushed down, and unheard.'' That night in Tianamen Square, the cries for a democracy rang out loud and clear, yet they soon would be replaced by different cries. With hearts of fire, the students would not back down to words of warning. The air of freedom was faintly tangible but soon dissipated as the piercing crack of gunfire drove fear back into the hearts of the young people. Shot down . . . beaten . . . imprisoned . . . in one way or another they were all silenced. And the freedom, once so close, was now ripped from their hands. This tragedy can conjure up a lot of emotions. For me, all I can do is feel grateful. Surely I have taken for granted the freedom of a democracy. I have the privilege to stand up and not be pushed down. I don't have to look over my shoulder in fear every time I speak up about the government. I have a voice. But what is so beautiful about America's democracy is that this voice is just as important, just as valid as the next man's. Though led by presidents, governors, senators, and representatives, I have just as much power to speak out as they do. My voice matters. Our forefathers designed the United States Constitution to keep the government from ever becoming so powerful, so tyrannical, that I no longer have the freedom to speak my mind. At the same time, the constitution keeps me in line and helps remind me of what is important to our democracy, so that I fight for ideas that are true, right, and noble. Personally, I've only recently begun to see how powerful my voice is, even though it is just one. A project was assigned in my political science class in which I needed to interview various state representative and senators. I was surprised at how easy it was to schedule an appointment with an elected official. When I was sitting in the office of my representative, my eyes were opened to the power of my own voice. I used to believe that my voice meant nothing because I wasn't old enough to vote. But what is amazing to me now is that I'm able to walk straight into our state's capital building, climb a few stairs, enter right into an office of a senator or representative, and explain to them exactly what I believe and why I believe it. Not only that, our government allows what I say to be taken into consideration. I can persuade others to take up my passion, believe what I believe, and push for a change. Though funded in basic principles, democracy is not set in stone. If I don't agree with something. I have the ability to work to change it. America, the world's largest democracy, will take time to listen to what I have to say. Because my voice in our democracy matters so much, I hold a tremendous respect for the United States of America. I see the value in a peaceful transition of leadership. I see the value of a ``majority rules'' policy. I see the value of my voice. Therefore, I will not sit back when I have such freedom in my grasp. I will use my voice to make our democracy a better place to be. In the words of Edward Everett Hale, ``I am only one, but still I am one . . I cannot do everything, but I can do something. . . and what I can do, I should do . . . and, with the help of God, I will do.''",

    "title": "BROWN TREE SNAKES THREATEN HAWAII",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring an article in the June/July 1998 National Wildlife Federation magazine to the attention of Congress.The article, entitled ``A State Without Snakes Keeps a Wary Eye Out for an Alien Invader,'' describes the threat that Hawaii faces from the brown tree snake. As explained by the article's author, the brown tree snake has already devastated the ecology of Guam, and it is one of the most frightening alien species threatening Hawaii today. If it manages to become established in Hawaii, the snake could decimate Hawaii's entire bird population, as it has already done on Guam. It is also known to attack babies, eat pets, and cause frequent electricity outages by climbing power lines.Numerous programs in both the public and private sectors have been organized to contain and control the brown tree snake population. They deserve our support. Hawaii has unique and endangered plant and animal species, many of which would be threatened if the snake succeeded in establishing itself in the Hawaiian Islands. It is possible, but unlikely, that this event may have already occurred. Because there are no natural predators, one pregnant snake could establish this species on the islands.As we move toward consideration of appropriations in the weeks ahead, I look forward to sufficient funds being approved by the House for brown tree snake research and eradication.Fred Kraus lifts a piece of corrugated metal, inspecting the ground beneath it. ``You have to think like a snake,'' he says, while considering places where a reptile might hide. In the middle of a Honolulu suburb, this wooded ravine offers unlimited possibilities: waist-high grass, tangled brush, rodent burrows, illegally dumped trash, even clumps of houseplants growing wild. As the alien species coordinator for Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources, Kraus is investigating a report of a snake seen by a boy playing in these woods. The brown- colored snake climbed a tree until it was level with the eyes of the boy, who turned and ran. Throughout much of the United States, such a snake sighting would attract little attention. But in Hawaii--except for the harmless, earthwormlike Brahminy blind snake, which was introduced to the state from Asia--there are no terrestrial snakes. So any sighting suggests frightening possibilities. Given the Aloha State's subtropical climate and lack of predators, some of the world's most venomous snakes could easily become established there. Kraus is particularly concerned about the threat of an infestation by Boiga irregularis, the brown tree snake. The cause of a devastating ecological catastrophe on the island of Guam, it is considered one of the most frightening alien species threatening Hawaii today. Biologists believe the first brown tree snakes arrived in Guam after World War II as stowaways on cargo ships from one of their homelands: northern Australia, Indonesia, New Guinea or the Solomon Islands. Free of the natural controls of their native habitat and finding abundant prey for every stage of their lives, the snakes multiplied at an astonishing rate. Some areas of Guam are now infested with as many as 12,000 brown tree snakes per square mile and bird life of any kind is rare on the Pacific island. An extraordinary climber, the snake devours eggs, hatchlings and adult birds. It has decimated 9 of Guam's 12 native forest birds, pushing 3 species into extinction. Another imperiled creature, the Marianas fruit bat, is also close to extinction because of snake predation. ``The brown tree snake is capable of adapting to many tropical areas,'' says Thomas Fritts, a biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey who has been studying the species since 1984. Sightings of the reptiles have been reported in Okinawa, Wake Island, the Marshall Islands, Tinian, Rota, Diego Garcia, Texas and Spain. Biologists believe that most or all of these snakes originated on Guam. Known for its bulging eyes and large head, an adult brown tree snake averages four to seven feet in length. It is a voracious nocturnal hunter that kills by constricting its prey with a mild venom injected with its back teeth. On Guam, it has snatched chickens and pets from yards and has even attacked babies asleep in cribs. Guam's public health records indicate that 74 toddlers were treated for snake bites between 1989 and 1995. To date, the reptile has not caused any human fatalities. But it has caused other problems for people. According to authorities at Guam's electric companies, the climbing snakes frequently short out power lines, causing an average of one electric outage every three days. Because the brown tree snake is light sensitive, it coils into concealed hiding places by day. When it selects an airplane wheel well or outgoing cargo as its hiding place, the reptile can hitchhike to new habitats. Since 1981, seven brown tree snakes have been found in Hawaii. All were captured or dead upon discovery, bit some other reported snake sightings have not been resolved and authorities worry whether they can effectively stop the reptile from slithering in the state. As home to 41 percent of all endangered birds in the nation, Hawaii has a lot to lose. The state imposes fines as high as $25,000 for importing or owning snakes of any type--a penalty that has not stopped people from smuggling in pythons and other snakes for pets. But the brown tree snake threat is different. ``Never in history has a snake done as much ecological damage as this snake,'' says Mike Pitzler, a biologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Guam. Pitzler leads a team of federal, state, military and private individuals struggling to keep snakes from leaving Guam aboard outgoing flights and ships. The team maintains 1,400 snake traps in airports and other targeted sites around the island. It also relies on 14 Jack Russell terriers, which work in shifts around the clock, sniffing aircraft and cargo for snakes before departure. Pitzler's staff captures 3,000 to 5,000 snakes per year, but he acknowledges his program's limitations. ``Our canine teams are not 100 percent effective all the time,'' he says. ``There are also cargo items that are difficult to inspect.'' On the Hawaiian island of Oahu, meanwhile, five beagles put their noses to work sniffing out snakes on arriving commercial and military flights from Guam. For most flights, one of the dogs and an inspector are waiting at the gate to examine the aircraft. The pair then hurries to a nearby warehouse to inspect cargo from the flight. But because of a shortage of funds for the program, not all military flights are inspected and that worries state authorities. ``Is there an acceptable risk? The answer for Hawaii is no,'' says Mike Wilson, chairperson of Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources. ``Every brown tree snake that we don't stop now will turn into tens of thousands of snakes over the next 10 or 20 years.'' The species has a clutch size of 4 to 12 young and females may produce more than one clutch per year. Newly hatched snakes immediately begin to forage for food. On Guam, small skinks are readily available prey for the young snakes. An introduced alien initially thought to be harmless, one skink species is largely responsible for the population explosion of brown tree snakes on the island by allowing greater numbers of the snakes to survive into adulthood. ``The relationship between skinks and the brown tree snake's population is an example of what happens when you introduce nonnative plants and animals to a place,'' says Kraus. ``You can get a synergistic effect, things that you never expected.'' If one of the reptiles should slither off into Hawaii's landscape, Kraus usually oversees efforts to find the reptile. ``In some habitats in Hawaii,'' he notes, ``you could be standing right next to a snake and not know it.'' To search for the snake that chased off the boy in the suburban Honolulu ravine, Kraus brought in eight volunteers. The reptile was never found, though he concluded that it was not a brown tree snake because it was sighted during daylight. While Kraus continues his exhaustive searches, other experts are pursuing new methods to eradicate the reptile. But so far no such method has been found. ``We continue looking for solutions,'' says Thomas Fritts. ``We're not ready to give up.''",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support for enactment of House Resolution 404, regarding relations between the people of the United States and those of the Philippines.It is significant that we enact the resolution to salute and congratulate the Philippines on the 100th anniversary of its independence from Spain and its achievement of the establishment of its democracy.It is also noteworthy that the resolution also thanks the Philippines for aiding the U.S. in World War II, the Korean War and in Vietnam. It underscores the need for Congress to enact the Filipino Veterans Equity Act to extend full veterans benefits to Filipino soldiers who fought along side U.S. soldiers in World War II.Mr. Speaker, approximately 200,000 Filipino soldiers were under the command of General Douglas MacArthur during the early months of World War II. During that period, our armed forces in the Philippines were isolated from food, medical and ammunition supplies. Filipino soldiers displayed exemplary loyalty and courage in the defense of their nation and fought in every major battle, including Bataan and Corregidor.Beyond the outstanding conduct of the regular Army forces, after the islands fell to Japan, thousands of courageous Filipinos took up arms to continue the fight through guerilla warfare against enormous odds. Not only did they undermine the occupation forces, but they provided valuable intelligence to U.S. forces in the Southwest Pacific, rescued downed American pilots and diverted powerful enemy forces from deployment elsewhere.An estimated 60,000 to 80,000 surviving Filipino veterans, however, have been denied the full range and extent of veterans benefits available to American veterans with whom they fought side by side. This is an intolerable situation and we must resolve to remedy this tragic and insensitive dilemma.I urge my colleagues to review the provisions of H.R. 836, the Philippines Veterans Equity Act, and support the effort to bring the bill to the House floor for debate and enactment.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 1847, the Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act.H.R. 1847 increases criminal penalties for telemarketing fraud, especially telemarketing fraud targeting senior citizens. Older Americans are the targets of many fraudulent telemarketers because they are generally home more often, may be more trusting, and they may be led to look on a smooth-talking telemarketer as a friend rather than someone preying on their life savings.The measure is a positive step forward to protecting consumers and our seniors, but we need to do more. Besides increasing penalties on fraudulent telemarketers, we need to help educate consumers of the dangers of fraudulent telemarketing. I sponsored several mail and telemarketing fraud briefings for senior citizens in my district, Honolulu, Hawaii. These educational briefings were designed to give vulnerable senior citizens a fighting chance against an industry designed to victimize them. I encourage my colleagues to work with organizations such as the AARP and educate senior citizens in their districts.H.R. 1847 also allows law enforcement officials to prosecute individuals for conspiracy to commit telemarketing fraud. This provision allows police and prosecutors to seek out and punish organizers of telemarketing scams, who often arrange the schemes but don't actually commit the fraud themselves.Telemarketing fraud robs Americans of an estimated $40 billion per year. The actual amount may be higher, because some consumers are too embarrassed to report that they have been defrauded or consumers fail to recognize that they have been victimized.I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1847 and continue to work to eliminate telemarketing and mail fraud.",

    "title": "ADDRESSING HAWAII'S ECONOMIC RECESSION",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues in Congress for all of their cooperation in our fight to help Hawaii's economy and to explain why the fight is far from over and why we must redouble our efforts to find solutions to the State's economic problems.Over the last few months, I have had success in bringing new jobs to Hawaii. For instance, the defense authorization bill contains over $200 million for new, needed construction projects in Hawaii, a record level. This includes renovation and construction of the barracks at Schofield and Kaneohe Marine base, as well as funding for Navy family housing and the Pearl Harbor Public Works Center.Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues' constituents are members of the U.S. military and reside for at least part of their time in service at Schofield or Kaneohe or Pearl Harbor. The military is very important to Hawaii. Having the military in Hawaii itself is vital to our national interests. I strongly believe we need to maintain and build upon the military presence in Hawaii as we approach the 21st century in the interest of the national interests of the United States.In addition to this, this year's transportation bill included funding for several vitally important highway projects which will further stimulate the construction industry in Hawaii, as well as provide much-needed improvements. I extend thanks for myself and on behalf of the people of Hawaii for all of the help that has come from Washington recently as we try to work our way out of this economic recession.Mr. Speaker, I returned recently from Hawaii and continue to hear from families and businesses that economic conditions are difficult and, therefore, the need for action by the State of Hawaii and Congress is necessary to return the islands to economic well-being.Although much of the mainland has been experiencing strong economic growth, Hawaii, despite periodic spurts of recovery, in fact remains stagnant. The 7-year recession in Japan and more recently in Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand has resulted in declining tourism, Hawaii's lifeblood, and subsequently high unemployment, record bankruptcies, foreclosures, and declining property values. In short, Hawaii is experiencing the deepest recession since statehood.Beyond the hardship being experienced by thousands of families in Hawaii, there have been layoffs which triggered declining confidence in the economy. There has been a cutback in spending and fearing for the future, a very real and human reaction I might say, Mr. Speaker.The consequence, however, is additional economic contraction, more layoffs and every business thus is affected.There is, in the face of this grim situation, knowledge that we will get back on our feet. In time, the Asian economies will restructure, currency exchange rates will stabilize, tourism will rebound, and the economy will regain its strength. We must, however, take every action available at the disposal of the Federal Government to cushion the recession and provide the short-term economic stimulation necessary to see it through the hard times.In addition to the successes I mentioned earlier, there are some projects still in the works. I am happy to be working with the Small Business Administration and the Department of Commerce to identify resources that can be brought to bear on our problems in Hawaii.For example, the Commerce Department needs adequate funding for its community and economic development program. A $50 million appropriation would provide needed grants for planning and technical assistance many communities need which are experiencing the economic problems that Hawaii has.I am working with the Congressional leadership and administration to reestablish the spousal business travel deduction and increasing business meal and entertainment deductions which will help promote tourism, not only for Hawaii, but all over the mainland as well. I have introduced legislation to repeal the airline tax in last year's budget bill. The highway bill, as I indicated, provided Hawaii with $135 million in annual formula grants and will fund numerous priority projects. Money will be coming in, for example, to help needed improvements in Honolulu's harbor.I will continue to call on Congress to pass funding for the International Monetary Fund. It is all too evident to the people of Hawaii that when the Asian economies suffer, the economy of our State suffers just as greatly. I might add by extension, Mr. Speaker, the mainland as well.We should send this money because it is the right thing to do and because anything that stabilizes the Asian economies will help increase tourism and help to stabilize our own economic progress throughout the United States.We must also focus on securing long-term solutions to our problems, improve our education for our children, higher medical care reimbursement. In Hawaii's case, I am helping to diversify Hawaii's agriculture and to upgrade the Pacific Missile Range Facility to help bring Hawaii's military facilities, which I have mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, Mr. Speaker, into the 21st Century.I also want to upgrade Hawaii's telecommunications links to the mainland and the world.Tourism, the military and agriculture will continue to be Hawaii's key industries in the next century. We must, however, be well prepared to guide the changes underway. In the long run, technology development and innovation, as well as diversity within those industries, will lead us back to economic growth, jobs and prosperity. We must make wise decisions in this time of economic crisis.I look forward to working with my colleagues to resolve Hawaii's economic problems.",

A 7-year commitment is not very long when it comes to agriculture, when it comes to making banking decisions.When we talk about special interests, Mr. Speaker, I can tell my colleagues I do represent a special interest, the special interest of people living in Hawaii, in housing that they could not afford if they were not able to keep the jobs they have right now. We are standing up for those who are the field workers, for the farmers and producers.

How is it possible for us to say that we can compete in a market in which we have child labor producing sugar, when we have oligarchs in other countries producing sugar and dumping sugar in our market? That is not the kind of thing we would be very proud of as a legacy to the children of our country, to say that we violated labor standards, health standards, environmental standards, all because we wanted to have cheap manufacture of sugar.Mr. Chairman, I ask in conclusion, please, let us keep our word as legislators.

But here I want to emphasize to all of my colleagues that we are talking about legal permanent residents; people who have served in the armed forces. We are in a situation in which we can have convicted felons who cannot vote, they can give money to a political campaign, but a legal permanent resident who is paying taxes, working hard, raising their families is not going to be allowed to give.I am speaking right now because my colleague over there is the one who is going to be asked. I get out of it. I listened to some people on the floor say ``if I was asked''. I guarantee if someone looks like me, with the same physiognomy that I do, they will probably not get asked.

We have only to look at Guam to understand the potential extinction of many species will, not might, result from the introduction of the snake to Hawaii.Guam now experiences an instance of more than 12,000 of these snakes per square mile. Entire species have disappeared from Guam since World War II when the snake was accidently brought to the island, most probably abroad military aircraft which had visited areas of the South Pacific in the snake's natural habitat.The Interior Appropriation bill contains $2.1 million for prevention, education, and inspection programs, an increase of $500,000 over last year. We need to step up our vigilance in Hawaii against this invasive species which has brought wildlife ruin elsewhere.The scientific community has not yet developed an effective eradication method. Although I hope we can soon understand how to control and eliminate the snake, until that time, the only action we can and must take is preventing its introduction into Hawaii.I am very pleased that the Committee on Appropriations has recommended an increase, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in achieving the highest funding level to achieve our goals.",

We lost two good men and fine police officers. No words can adequately express our feelings on this sad occasion. Our hearts go out to their families and to their fellow officers.This tragedy highlights a dilemma as old as democracy itself: the balance between security and openness. We have made a decision--the correct decision, I believe--to maintain public accessibility to the Capitol. The people's business must be open to the public gaze. Every year people from our districts, some traveling literally thousands of miles, visit the Capitol to share their views and urge us to support or oppose this or that bill. They come to partake of the history that walks these halls. They come simply to see us in the flesh, look us in the eye, and take the measure of the men and women whom they have elected to make our laws. Their right to do so is enshrined in the very concept of democracy. Nowhere is it more appropriate to exercise that right than here in the people's house.At the same time, we can not escape the reality of the world in which we live.

Their bravery and devotion to duty enshrine the names of Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson among the heroes of our nation. We bow our heads in sorrow and gratitude.

    "title": "SPOUSAL TRAVEL DEDUCTION",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am introducing legislation today which will help America's working individuals and families, particularly those associated with the travel and tourism industry.My bill would re-instate the federal income tax deduction for expenses of persons traveling with spouses on business purposes. As you may know, the spousal travel deduction was a long established part of the tax code until 1993. At that time, President Clinton, as a part of his first budget to Congress proposed repeal of the deduction, along with many other tax changes. I supported his budget, despite reservations about some of the tax proposals, such as cutting the business meal and entertainment expense deduction from 80 per cent to 50 per cent, because they would have detrimental impact on the travel and tourism industry. Nonetheless, the need to reorder the nation's priorities was essential and overwhelming, and I voted in favor of the legislation.Supporting the 1993 budget was a difficult decision, but it was the correct one. It set the basis for rapid decline in the budget deficits which have plagued the nation for decades. We now have a budget surplus projected to be in excess of $50.0 billion. The travel industry and those states and localities dependent on the industry have sacrificed substantially in order to get our financial house in order.There is growing support for Congress enacting tax cut and reform legislation before we adjourn in October. I have worked closely in a bipartisan manner with the Congressional leadership, members of the Ways and Means Committee and with the Administration to generate support reinstating the deduction, and many have been encouraging on the proposal's merits and the beneficial impact that it will have on the economy.This bill is important to the working men and women of our country. The travel and tourism industry generates millions of jobs for our economy, and importantly, many of those jobs are entry level and give a first employment chance to less skilled workers, immigrants and those entering the job market for the first time. It provides an entry into the job market and opportunities for skill development, training and advancement. Representing a state and city very heavily dependent on travel and tourism, I have seen first-hand individual get a first break in the hotel and restaurant industries and advance in responsibility into management and supervisory positions. This is repeated throughout the country, but it is particularly apparent in areas with significant numbers of tourists, such as Honolulu, Las Vegas, Orlando, Los Angeles, New Orleans, San Francisco, Miami and countless other communities across the nation.I also believe that there are significant misconceptions about the spousal travel deduction. It has been unfairly characterized as wealthy businessmen traveling to exotic locations and deducting the expenses of the wife. The reality is the deduction has been much more frequently taken by traveling salesmen and saleswomen and small business owners attending trade shows or soliciting business in trips across the around the nation. It was a middle-income tax, not an abuse exploited by the wealthiest. The wealthy have tax shelters that pale the spousal travel deduction, shelters not available to the working men and women of our country. The vast majority of beneficiaries solid, hard-working, tax-paying Americans with a couple of kids, trying to make ends meet. Those are the people we should be designing the tax system to give a fair shake.I will be working in the next weeks and months in this Congress to move this legislation forward. Any tax reform or reduction legislation should address this issue. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in Congress to making enactment of this bill a reality.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spence) for their wise counsel and their ready availability to all the Members, including this Member, with respect to any aspect of our Committee on National Security reports and this conference report.Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank as well to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Hefley), my subcommittee chairman and my friend. Unfortunately, he is not on the floor at the moment, but I hope that my good wishes and good feelings towards him will be conveyed. I thank him for his leadership and for the fair process by which he has handled the military construction portion of the Defense authorization bill. His collegial and bipartisan approach encourages and in fact has yielded an outcome which shuns parochialism and constantly strives for the good-government solutions that this bill represents to difficult funding issues. It is made even more difficult by the constrained fiscal environment which has been mentioned.Mr. Speaker, I will not take up the Members' time in repeating the details of the report, only to point out however that the budget adopted by the conferees represents a considerable effort in bettering the quality of life for our military personnel.A good portion of the $666 million that was added to the President's request for military construction is to be spent on the most intractable problem we face, military housing; $101 million towards improving existing family housing units and $153 million towards new barracks and dormitories. Quality of life of our military personnel will be improved as a result.Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell my colleagues we are far from our goal of adequate housing. More spending is needed. As this bill goes forward, the condition of the military installation continues to deteriorate. We will be working on it.Though I support the bill, I want to express my continued concern that we are unable to assure a level playing field for small businesses. I have worked with the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Talent) on the CLASS proposal in the House passed authorization, because it improves the quality of life again for our service members and maintains a level playing field for small businesses to compete in the forwarding of household goods. Unfortunately, in the end, we were not able to get agreement on this. I can assure my colleagues we will work to resolve this issue in the best interests of our men and women in the Armed Forces.Regrettably, also the Charter and Build provision was not included. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Bateman) in particular for his steadfast resolution in this regard. The provision is good for America because it provides a means for the Navy to acquire the ships it needs to meet our strategic requirements and sustain the industrial base needed to produce them. The issue, I assure my colleagues, will be revisited until it is won.Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spence) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) for their leadership on this issue. I tell my colleagues that they can rest assured that I will continue to work with them on behalf of the strategic interests of the United States of America.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 417, the Energy Conservation Reauthorization Act of 1998.The legislation we are considering today is important to the State of Hawaii and the Nation. Hawaii and the Pacific territories have special needs during an energy emergency since we are isolated from the U.S. energy supply by more than 7,000 miles or one-quarter of the way around the globe. Oil accounts for more than 90 percent of Hawaii's energy and almost all of our oil is imported. In addition, we depend entirely on oil for our electricity generation.The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Louisiana and Texas is designed to help all consumers by dampening price rises and using markets to allocate oil efficiently through swaps or proximity delivery. Even so, time emergency deliveries are still problematic. Since all of our oil is delivered by tanker, we are very vulnerable to a cutoff of oil supplies. This bill gives Hawaii emergency access to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve so that we can submit a special bid for oil during a declared emergency.The oil price from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would equal the average of all SPR bids accepted by the Department of Energy. This bill also permits Hawaii to enter into an exchange agreement directing the SPR oil to be delivered to locations other than Hawaii.Another important provision in this bill is the biodiesel amendment. This provision should be important to all farmers and people concerned about the environment. Biodiesel is a renewable alternative fuel derived from vegetable oil or animal fat. It can be made from soybeans, canola, and even waste oils from fast food restaurants.Biodiesel fuel has many advantages. It is nontoxic. It can cut emissions of particulate matter and hydrocarbons in half. It can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Most important, biodiesel can reduce our national reliance on foreign oil.Biodiesel can be used directly in bus, truck, and marine vessel diesel engines. It does not require new refueling stations, new parts or expensive engine modifications.Islands are particularly suited to the manufacture of biodiesel fuels, as shown by Pacific Biodiesel. All islands have a difficult time disposing of waste products since landfill space is limited. On the islands of Hawaii, used cooking oils were unnecessarily taking up landfill space. Pacific Biodiesel currently processes 10,000 gallons of used cooking oil each month into premium biodiesel fuel. Many of the hotel buses in Hawaii now use biodiesel fuel that is produced by Pacific Biodiesel. Boats in the marinas are also using this high-quality fuel. The amendments to this bill will protect Hawaii from an energy crisis. They will also help our farmers and our environment. I urge my colleagues to support S. 417.",

    "title": "THE HAWAII FEDERAL MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PERCENTAGE ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 1999",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to re-introduce legislation to adjust the State of Hawaii's Federal medical assistance percentage [FMAP] rate. The intent of this bill is to more fairly reflect the ability of the state to bear its share of Medicaid payments. I am happy to have my colleague, Representative Patsy Mink, as a cosponsor of this measure. I am also pleased that our Hawaii Senators, Senator Daniel Akaka and Senator Daniel Inouye, have introduced similar legislation in the Senate, S. 264.The FMAP, or Federal share of the medical assistance expenditures under each state's Medicaid program, is determined annually by a formula that compares a state's average per capita income level with the national income average. States with a higher per capita income level are reimbursed a smaller share of their Medicaid costs. By law, the FMAP cannot be lower than 50 percent nor higher than 83 percent. In 1997, the FMAPs varied from 50 percent to 77.2 percent, with Hawaii receiving the lowest 50 percent rate.Alaska was another state receiving the lowest FMAP rate in 1997. However, in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, a provision increasing Alaska's FMAP rate to 59.8 percent for the next 3 years was included. Language in the Balanced Budget Act also mentioned that the same conditions warranting an increase in Alaska's FMAP rate applied to the State of Hawaii. The legislation that I am introducing today would conform Hawaii's rate with Alaska's. This bill would increase Hawaii's FMAP rate from 50 percent to 59.8 percent.The rationale for the FMAP change is quite simple. Hawaii's high cost of living skews the per capita income determining factor. Based on 1995 United States Census data, the cost of living in Honolulu is 83 percent higher than the average of the metropolitan areas. More recent studies have shown that for the state as a whole, the cost of living is more than one-third higher than the rest of the United States. In fact, Hawaii's Cost of Living Index ranks as the highest in the country. If per capita income is measured in real terms, the State of Hawaii ranks 47th at $19,755 compared to the national average of $24,231 (according to the twenty-first edition of ``The Federal Budget and the States,'' a joint study conducted by the Taubman Center for State and Local Government at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government and the office of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan). Thus, Hawaii's 50 percent FMAP rate is understated because cost of living factors are not considered. Per capita income is a poor measure of Hawaii's relative ability to bear the cost of Medicaid services.Some government programs take the high cost of living in Hawaii into account and funding is adjusted accordingly. These programs include Medicaid prospective payment rates, food stamp allocations, school lunch programs, housing insurance limits, Federal employee salaries, and military living expenses. These examples show a Federal recognition that the higher cost of living in noncontiguous states should be taken into account in fashioning government program policies. It is time for similar recognition of this factor in gauging Hawaii's ability to support its health care programs. It is time to pass my bill increasing Hawaii's FMAP from 50 percent to 59.8 percent.Setting a higher match rate as was done for Alaska would still leave Hawaii with a lower FMAP rate than a majority of the states. However, the higher rate would better recognize Hawaii's ability to pay its fair share of the costs of the Medicaid program and I am committed to achieving it.",

    "title": "NIKITIN TRIAL TO PROCEED IN RUSSIA",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge that the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Ganske) is here to begin his hour presentation, I believe, and I want to thank him for his courtesy in allowing me to claim this five minutes. I am sure that he will join with me and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) and others with respect to the very important subject that we wish to devote just a few minutes to today.Mr. Speaker, surely we can take some time at this particular juncture to devote attention, in this special order, to the difficulties that are now being experienced in what was the former Soviet Union, that is to say, in Russia.The Supreme Court in a Supreme Court session in Russia is being held on the 4th of February with respect to the Alexander Nikitin case. The case, Mr. Speaker, is important not only to Captain Nikitin and those who are interested in addressing issues of freedom in Russia, but it has profound consequences for all of us on the planet.Captain Nikitin has been the leading exponent of making clear what is happening with nuclear deterioration with the submarine fleet in the former Soviet Union. The degradation that is taking place in the environment there is something of concern, not only to the Russian people, but to all of us throughout the world. He is now being tried as a result of trying to bring this information forward in a more clear sense than it has been available before.I want to indicate for those Members and those who may become aware of the special orders today throughout the Nation that they can contact the Bellona Foundation, B-E-L-L-O-N-A, at P.O. Box 11835 in Washington D.C., 20008, and contact the Bellona Foundation if you want to aid and assist Captain Nikitin in Russia, if you want to become more aware of what is taking place with the deterioration of the nuclear submarines in the former Soviet Union.The Supreme Court is going to hear the appeal, as I indicated, on Thursday, February 4. I expect a verdict will be there the same day.For those of you who are not familiar with the case and the circumstances, let me give you a little background very quickly. The Council for Criminal Cases in the Supreme Court in Russia takes many former Soviet dissidents back to the times of the KGB. They have a special department there supervised by the KGB. They used to have one responsible for handling crimes against the state.I want it understood what is being said in Russia today is to express opinions and to discuss information that is otherwise available publicly, in public, in Russia today, is seen as a point of subversion and treason. That is what Captain Nikitin is being tried for.So what we are asking, Mr. Speaker, is that the Department of State pay particular interest and approach their counterparts in Moscow to indicate that the United States is very, very concerned about this situation, that we are watching it, that they are not going to be able to do this behind closed doors and get away with it. They are not used to public hearings in Russia and they are scared to go public on this.It is very, very important that Captain Nikitin's case be recognized by our Department of State as something that Members of this Congress are very, very concerned about, and I call on other Members to acquaint themselves with the circumstances.The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) is well aware of it, as I said. He is unable to be with us today to discuss the situation further. But I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, and I assure the other Members, this is not the last time that I will be on this floor, nor that individuals like the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) will be here.Let me conclude by indicating to that on a recent Congressional delegation trip to Russia, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) as the ranking Democrat on the Committee on Armed Services led a delegation of individuals from the Congress there, and we met with Captain Nikitin.We can provide you information, Mr. Speaker, on the case in more detail, but we just want to alert you and alert the State Department today that we expect to have this case front and center in the consciences of everyone who is concerned about the environmental degradation taking place in Russia today as a result of the deterioration of the nuclear submarines that are presently being mothballed.Mr. Speaker, I insert the following for the Record:Dr. Caraway: As you know the Supreme Court will hear the Nikitin appeal on Thursday. The verdict should be announced the same day. We will see then. Unfortunately, the hearing will take place behind closed doors, somewhat incomprehensible given that the hearing is not about the secrecy question, but about procedural issues. Yours, Thomas Jandl, Director, Bellona USA.",

    "title": "INVESTMENT IN WOMEN'S HEALTH ACT OF 1999",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to re-introduce the Investment in Women's Health Act. I am re-introducing this bill with Congresswoman Mary Bono and the support of the National Cervical Cancer Coalition, the College of American Pathologists, and the American Society of Clinical Pathologists.Last year, Dr. James Navin from Straub Hospital visited my office to alert me to a very serious inequity in the pap smear reimbursement rate in Hawaii. Health insurers in Hawaii had apparently taken a cue from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and lowered their pap smear reimbursement rate. Under this lower rate, the local laboratories would lose a significant amount of money on each screening. In fact, the reimbursement rate was low enough to force the laboratories to consider getting out of the business completely. Fortunately, the laboratories were able to convince the health insurers of the need for increased reimbursement. The laboratories were then compensated with a break even reimbursement rate for the pap smears.I soon found out that the low reimbursement rate is not only a problem in Hawaii, but across the entire United States. The low rate of Medicare reimbursement for pap smears has an impact on the rates paid by third party payers who peg their payments on what the government pays.To address the deficiency, I introduced legislation last year to raise HCFA's reimbursement rate for pap smears. Due to wide spread support, progress on this issue was made with the inclusion of report language in the Omnibus bill for fiscal year 1999 urging HCFA to use its existing statutory authority to raise the reimbursement rate by administrative action.Unfortunately, the reimbursement rate has not increased and the time table for any change is unclear. In order to rectify this situation, my legislation defines the date for an increase in the pap smear reimbursement rate and sets the rate at the national average for production costs. For women in Hawaii and the rest of the nation, this means we can assure their access to reliable and timely pap smear results.Everyone knows that pap smears save lives. With annual screening, the chance of developing cervical cancer can be reduced to less than 1%. Over the last 40 years, the incidence of invasive cervical cancer has decreased significantly due to early detection efforts. Still, an estimated 13,700 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in 1998, and 4,900 women will die of the disease. Screening for cervical cancer allows doctors to catch the disease in its early stages and save a life. A 70 percent decline in deaths due to cervical cancer in the last 50 years can be directly attributed to pap smears.An adequate pap smear reimbursement level demonstrates respect for the women and families who benefit from a timely and accurate annual pap smear. I am anxious to continue the work we have begun with HCFA and am counting on my colleagues support for the Investment in Women's Health Act of 1999.",

Serving side by side with active military personnel, fire fighters and other professional counterparts, some Guard and Reservists are exposed to hazardous and physically demanding duty as a routine part of their job. A well-earned and timely retirement should be a welcome relief from a job that requires youth, strength and virgo. Yet, for a select group of talented individuals, known as Dual Status Technicians, retirement eligibility is several years beyond that of their counterparts.Dual Status Technicians are held to the same physical and mental criteria as their military counterparts and the jobs they perform are likewise challenging. Although active military personnel, fire fighters and federal police can retire after 20 years of service, Technicians must work until age 55 with 30 years of service to receive full benefits. This bill gives Dual Status Technicians retirement eligibility equity with their counterparts.The Military Reserve (Dual Status) Technicians Retirement Equity Bill allows qualified National Guard and Reservists the option to retire under the same criteria as other professionals in similar challenging careers.",

And if this situation is not resolved, if we just continue on with the bombing so that the bombing becomes its own reason for being, then we will find ourselves in a situation in which the Congress, at a minimum, let alone the people of the United States, will find themselves in a position of having to passively stand by and let events get in the saddle and ride us.",

The bipartisan delegation prepared a resolution expressing the sense of Congress in supporting the recommendations of the Vienna meeting to bring about a fair, equitable and peaceful settlement in Yugoslavia. That draft resolution is attached. Additionally, I have attached a letter I sent to minority Leader Gephardt. I ask that you also support a bipartisan caucus so that the delegation can brief all members of Congress. Absent a bipartisan caucus, I ask your support for the delegation to brief the Armed Services Committee. This meeting with members of the Duma represents a singularly important step toward a negotiated solution. I seek your counsel and recommendations on how to best proceed. Sincerely, Neil Abercrombie, Member of Congress.Mr. Speaker, I wish to conclude my remarks by merely saying that the road to the resolution of this crisis is not in Belgrade and is not in Brussels, but is in fact in Moscow.The 11 of us, the bipartisan delegation which went to Vienna, had as its sole purpose the reaching out to the Members of the Russian Duma in an attempt to bring resolution to this crisis and bring it to a resolution at the earliest possible moment.Mr. Speaker, thank you for the time and I thank my colleagues for their generosity in providing it.",

    "title": "CONGRATULATIONS TO BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL RECIPIENT PRINCESS VICTORIA KA'IULANI ELEMENTARY SCHOOL",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Princess Victoria Ka'uilani Elementary School, which has earned the prestigious Blue Ribbon Schools Award from the U.S. Department of Education.The Blue Ribbon Schools Program identifies and gives national recognition to a diverse group of public and private schools that have been judged particularly effective in meeting local, state, and national goals. In being selected, Princess Ka'iulani Elementary School displayed the qualities of excellence that are necessary to prepare our young people for the challenges of the next century. The school demonstrates its strong leadership by providing high quality teaching, instilling policies and practices that ensure a safe environment conducive to learning, initiating strong parental and community involvement, and helping all students achieve to high standards.The awarding of Princess Victoria Ka'iulani Elementary School as a Blue Ribbon School is made even more special by the fact that this year marks the school's centennial anniversary. The school opened its doors on April 22, 1899 and was named for the beautiful Princess Victoria Ka'iulani. The name Ka'iulani means ``Child from Heaven.'' The students come from diverse cultures and various social backgrounds in the Kalihi-Palama neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawaii. And while the neighborhood is sometimes known for gangs and drug dealing, the school has a warm and friendly environment. The school definitely exudes the spirit of ``aloha'' and ``ohana'' (family). This nurturing atmosphere helps students to believe in themselves and offers an opportunity to learn and move forward.There are a variety of factors that contribute to the school's success. For example, at the beginning of each year, parents are given a student ready reference guide, a school profile, and a syllabus of the school's curriculum and activities. To further initiate parental involvement, a monthly parent bulletin is jointly authored by Title I, Parent-Community Networking Centers (PCNC), Primary School Adjustment Project (PSAP) and the Principal. Community involvement is also well established. Groups such as The Rotary Club of Metropolitan Honolulu, the USS Louisville, 516th Signal Brigade from the Fort Shafter Army Installation and the USS Chicago have contributed to the school's various campus beautification projects, providing access to the Internet and even assisting in classes and chaperoning field trips. Also, English Second Language Learners (ESLL) provides support to 101 students whose native language range from Vietnamese, Ilocano, Cantonese, Samoan, Tagalog, Visayan, Lao, Korean, Mandarin, Tongan, Micronesian and Fijian. In fact, students have continued to improve in Stanford Achievement Test (SAT) scores and due to a strong focus on literacy, reading levels have significantly increased over the past few years.Again, I wish to commend and congratulate the students, teachers, parents, administration, and staff of Princess Victoria Ka'iulani Elementary School for its strong efforts and proud achievement in receiving the Blue Ribbon Schools Award.",

    "text": "Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.I rise today in strong support of what the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer) has correctly characterized as a bipartisan amendment. I would think that we might even say that it is a nonpartisan amendment, to offer the thrift savings plan to our dedicated service members. As the senior Democrat on the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, I am extremely proud of the compensation package that we have put in this bill to help military personnel. This package addressed pay and retirement, as the gentleman from Indiana indicated, in a comprehensive fashion. May I add parenthetically, Madam Chairman, that I give full credit to the gentleman from Indiana for the really fabulous job that he, the staff and the other Members did with respect to making this truly comprehensive and far reaching.We were unable to include, as he indicated, a provision that we both viewed as critical not only to the military, but to the economic security of this Nation, the Thrift Savings Plan.We have the lowest personal savings rate since 1950. Over the past year, the personal savings rate, the amount of savings divided by disposable income expressed as a percentage in this country, has been less than 1 percent. The savings rate in the country is important because it represents the resources that can be used to create, sustain or expand the Nation's capital. Savings represent the potential for long-term future growth and increase the national standard of living, and we want our military to be able to participate in it.As a Nation, we should encourage all people to save, and, as an employer, the government is remiss if we do not offer that same opportunity to the military. Service members should be extended the same benefits as other Federal employees.Madam Chairman, as my colleagues know, we, as Members of Congress, are permitted to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan, and we think that, at a minimum, equity requires us to open up this process to members of the United States military. There are currently 1.4 million employees who do not have the employer-sponsored savings plan; that is the military. The military is the largest employer that does not offer a 401(k) plan. We do offer the benefit to Federal civilians, as I indicated, of the Thrift Savings Plan.Extending this plan to the military will have a salutary effect on the economy. Participation in the Thrift Savings Plan is 86.1 percent of the FERS employees and 61.2 percent of the CRS employees. If only 61.2 percent of the people in the military were to participate, there would be 848,000 participants. This amounts to a total contribution of additional savings of almost $1 billion over a 10-year period.It is past overdue then for us to extend this benefit to the military and allow them the benefit from and contribute to the growth of the economy.So I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment and reiterate, if I might, in this closing portion of these remarks that this is the product, this amendment is the product of a work effort which has characterized the Subcommittee on Military Personnel of the Committee on Armed Services from the beginning under the leadership of the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer) which was one of encouragement and cooperation not only extended to all Members, but extended to all members of the armed services who were invited to participate in our deliberations, and credit for that goes to the leadership of Mr. Buyer.Madam Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Maloney) to speak on the amendment.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Buyer-Abercrombie amendment to provide, in law, a provision for disability separation and retirement for service members with pre-existing conditions. This amendment is one of the en-bloc amendments.Current law does not include a standard to establish eligibility for disability retirement and separation based on medical conditions that existed prior to members entry into military service. Previously, disability retirement and separation based on pre-existing medical condition had been authorized in regulations after eight years of service.In 1979 the Department of Defense recommended to the Congress that disability compensation be extended to personnel with less than eight years of service, in order not to ``worsen . . . the competitive position of the armed forces in attracting and retaining the numbers and quality of members essential to the proper functioning of the forces'' in context of the ``All Volunteer'' service. Congress, under the Military Personnel and Compensation Amendments of 1980, approved this request. The DoD disability directive written at this time maintained the eight years length of service requirement only for pre-existing conditions. That policy was removed from the regulations in 1996 after a legal finding that there was no law to support the policy.Only in very rare instances is medical evidence provided that states unequivocally that military service played no part in the progression of the disease. In fact, such evidence has been presented for just a handful of diseases i.e. (Retinitis Pigmentosa, Huntington's Chorea) and the Services have found their hands tied by current DoD policy and legislation.This amendment offered by myself and Mr. Buyer would place in law a well-conceived and once well-executed policy and has the strong support of the Department of Defense. Adoption of this proposal would provide compensation to a small number of deserving people--perhaps 50 annually--that are afflicted by hereditary or congenital disease undetected at the time they joined the military.These affected service members are patriots, who after faithfully serving their country for at least eight years, are now told they are no longer fit for military duty because of a pre-existing condition. These men and women joined the military in good faith and it is that good faith that we must return to them. Mr. Buyer and I strongly urge our colleagues to support the amendment.The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. All time has expired.The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer).",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I can fully understand why people would want to try and save money but this kind of approach is, I think, unpardonable. I wish the gentleman had discussed the issue perhaps with myself, with the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Meek), with some others who are familiar with these programs. They perform an invaluable service, and to simply take the position that we are going to hack them in half or chop dollars out and let them try to fend afterwards as best they may is such a cavalier approach to cost cutting that it undermines, I think, entirely the thrust of any attempt to try and save money genuinely.These institutions are providing an intellectual foundation that gives us the opportunity, as Mr. Gejdenson indicated, to formulate policy in an intelligent way that saves the taxpayer dollars and allows us to carry foreign policy, in particular, forward in a manner that befits the strategic interests of this Nation.Mr. Chairman, this amendment is ill-timed. It is ill-founded and should be defeated.Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak against this amendment to H.R. 2415, the State Department authorization for FY2000. The amendment makes an ill advised 31 percent reduction in the bill's funding for the Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange between East and West, more commonly known as the East-West Center.The East-West Center has already suffered severe budget cuts during this decade. Further cuts would seriously compromise the national interests of the United States by weakening our full and constructive engagement in the Asia-Pacific area, which is emerging as the most dynamic region of the globe.The East-West Center was established by the Congress in 1960 to improve mutual understanding and cooperation among the governments and peoples of the Asia-Pacific region, including the United States. The Center helps prepare the United States for constructive involvement in Asia and the Pacific through education, dialogue, research and outreach. The Congress and Executive Branch agencies turn to the Center for advice and information.During the Center's 39 years of existence, more than 50,000 Americans, Asians and Pacific Islanders from over 60 nations and territories have participated in the East-West Center's educational, research and conference programs. Presidents, prime ministers, diplomats and distinguished scholars and statesmen from all parts of the region have used the Center as a forum to advance international cooperation. The Center has become one of the most highly respected institutions in the region.The friendly relations which exist today between the United States and countries of Asia and the Pacific are attributable in large measure to the work of the East-West Center.The 21st century will be the Pacific Century. Our relations with the nations of the region will determine America's role in the Pacific Century. Will we retain our position of leadership, or will we be relegated to the margins of the Pacific Century? The answer depends to a large extent on our commitment to understanding the region, demonstrating our involvement with its future, and nurturing our ties to its leaders of today and tomorrow.I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment and send a clear signal that U.S. interest in and commitment to the Asia-Pacific region remain undiminished.",

It is not an entity which the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink) or myself are associated with as Members of Congress per se. It is not an institution of the University of Hawaii or the State of Hawaii.I was there when it was founded 39 years ago when I was a student at the University of Hawaii. I am well acquainted with many of the alumni, Mr. Chairman, some 40,000 plus.We just finished today the conference report on the Committee on Armed Services. We have to fund our Armed Services because of our relationships to be prepared to defend the strategic interests of the United States and the Pacific Rim to the tune of billions and billions of dollars. We have 40,000 friends in Asia as a result of their experience at the East-West Center, which happens to be in Hawaii, which is the gateway for the United States of America and to all of Asia and South Asia and the Pacific Rim.I urge the Chair, and I urge the committee members who will be conference members as they deal with the Senate, to have an open mind based on the facts as I have outlined them and the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink) has outlined them and based on the fact that the East-West Center is very much in the strategic interests of the United States as a Federally chartered institution and as a catalyst for friendship throughout all of Asia for the United States of America.",

But in this particular instance, it seems to me that the overall course of events associated with the Department of Defense bill, the authorization bill that we have before us, merits our support.I will not recite it at great length other than to submit for the Record what we did with the Subcommittee on Military Personnel over and above the pay raise and the other issues that have been brought forward. I can say, I think, on behalf of the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer) as the chairman, that there are at least 17 specific issues associated with personnel measures that are a distinct advancement, some perhaps the best in 20 years. That is what is at stake with this bill.I want to mention just one in particular, the Thrift Savings Plan, that we have put forward. How can we expect to have our federal employees, which in effect our military are, be absent from the opportunity to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan. This bill provides for that opportunity. This takes 1.4 million families in the military, it takes 1.4 million people in the guard and reserves and their families, and makes them equal partners with the rest of us in the progress of this Nation as we turn the corner and the century.Mr. Speaker, I need go no further than to say that, as we go to East Timor, we will be calling up reservists to go to East Timor. We cannot conduct our deployments around the world without a guard and reserve component in conjunction with the act of military.So whether it is in East Timor, whether it is in Kosovo, whether it is in Bosnia, or whether it is in the United States, the armed services of the United States, in all their aspects, deserves our full support.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of the Lofgren-Conyers amendment to H.R. 2436, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. The bill is unfortunately flawed and needs to be modified because it fails to address the underlying issue--violence against women--pregnant or not. The majority of crimes against women occur during domestic violence and drunk driving incidents. I supported the Violence Against Women Act [VAWA] when it first became law in 1994. VAWA set up a national domestic violence hotline, grants for law enforcement, prosecution, and battered women shelters to combat violence and sexual assault. This Congress, I am a proud cosponsor of VAWA II which reauthorizes the original VAWA 1994 Act and has other provisions to further help protect women from violence. For example, the bill addresses sexual assault prevention and combating violence in the workplace.When we create laws that affect women, we cannot take the woman out of the equation which is what H.R. 2436 does. The woman is the victim of the crime and one of the best ways to protect a woman is to have VAWA II passed. I think everyone agrees that crimes against women are horrible. It's especially tragic when the woman is pregnant and that needs to be appropriately addressed which is why I am supporting the Lofgren-Conyers substitute, the Motherhood Protection Act of 1999.The Lofgren-Conyers substitute creates a federal criminal offense for harm to a pregnant woman and recognizes that the pregnant woman is the victim of a crime causing termination or harm during a pregnancy. The substitute provides for a maximum 20-year sentence for injury to a pregnant woman and a maximum life sentence for the termination of a pregnancy due to the assault. By focusing on the harm to the pregnant woman, it provides a deterrent against violence against women. I encourage my colleagues to support the Lofgren-Conyers substitute.",

    "title": "SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SHARK FINNING",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 189, relating to the practice of shark finning.There is no question that the practice is wasteful of a resource and should be discontinued. This issue has been on the agenda of the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council (WESPAC), which is responsible for managing our Western Pacific fisheries resources. WESPAC has been studying this issue, and I encourage them to continue to do so in order to compile the necessary data to take definitive action. In that regard, I would note that the Council has requested additional funds from NMFS during the past three years to do so, and as evidenced by our endorsement of this resolution today, there is a critical need for NMFS to comply with the request. I want to work closely with Representatives Eni Faleomavaega, Jim Saxton, Wayne Gilchrest, George Miller, Don Young and the Appropriations Committee to make sure there is adequate federal support for the broad and extensive responsibilities for which WESPAC is charged. The fisheries of the Western Pacific economic zones for which WESPAC is responsible comprises approximately forty-eight percent of the entire area NMFS regulates, but WESPAC receives only twelve percent of the total funding all the commissions receive. We must make certain that we give the Commission the tools, resources and support they need in order to credibly discharge their formidable responsibilities.Secondly, I would like to point out that even with enactment of this resolution or additional legislation amending the Magnuson-Stevens Act to ban shark finning, this is an international problem, and follow-up action must be initiated and undertaken in order to effectively end the practice internationally. Far more fins are unloaded in California ports, Hong Kong and other sites than in Hawaii, and the issue of transshipping of fins must also be addressed. If we are serious about ending finning, we need to act on several fronts.By citing the waste inherent in finning, the resolution raises the issue of full utilization of the products harvested from sharks. Fins should not be the only part of animal used and we need to develop refined products and markets in order to more fully make good use of shark parts. The resolution cites the waste inherent in finning, and yet there is an implicit level of utilization in other marine products. For example, to what extent is taking solely roe from fish or sea urchins wasteful? NMFS should address these utilization issues as it undertakes regulatory actions impacting shark catches.The last matter I would like to raise is that of compensation for lost income which will be sustained by Hawaii fishermen and industry. Shark fins generate significant revenue, and traditionally most of its goes directly to the crews of the fishing fleet. The resolution does not address lost compensation for crews, but I am pointing out the issue to indicate the complexity of the issue, and equity in addressing the economic consequences of fisheries regulatory decisions, based on precedents set by previous NMFS actions and decisions.Again, Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the resolution, as well as addressing the underlying and associated issues it raises.",

    "title": "CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET--FISCAL YEAR 2001",
    "text": "Mr. Chairman, as the ranking member of the House Subcommittee on Military Personnel of the Committee on Armed Services, I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered by my dear friend and colleague, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt).All Members who believe that we owe our military service members and their family members access to quality health care should support the substitute amendment being offered by the gentleman from South Carolina. The budget being proposed by the gentleman from South Carolina upholds the commitment to our armed forces personnel, particularly our military retirees who were promised health care in return for service to this great Nation.I support the Democratic budget amendment because it embodies the spirit of H.R. 3655, a bill I introduced along with the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton), the ranking member of the House Committee on Armed Services, and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor), to improve health care services for our Nation's service members, retirees, and their dependents.I regret deeply that the Committee on the Budget failed to incorporate necessary authority for the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, enabling us to complete that which should be a bipartisan task. I have high regard for the commitment of the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer) on these issues. Last year's success on efforts regarding pay, promotion, and benefits in the context of recruitment, retention, and retirement demonstrated what can be done when we set aside partisan considerations. I intend to continue to work with the chairman to accomplish these goals.But absent the Committee on the Budget preparing us for this, we have to go with the Democratic substitute in order to have our military retirees, our existing active duty members and their families receive the kind of health care that they have been promised. Our active duty troops and their families are having difficulty with access to military health care systems.The budget alternative before us today would allow for the elimination of copays for active duty personnel and their families who are in the TRICARE Prime program. The amendment also increases access to health care.Currently, families that receive care at a military treatment facility pay no co-payments. However, families that are not fortunate to live near a military treatment facility and use civilian health care providers in the TRICARE PRIME system must pay co-pays. This is not fair.The amendment also increases access to health care for our military family members who are often living in remote, rural areas by expanding the TRICARE Prime Remote program. These families are doing some of the hardest duty in the military. We should ensure that these families are cared for, which means that they should not have to drive hundreds of miles to receive health care for which they are entitled. Their ability to access health care services is just as important.Mr. Chairman, as our honored retired service members continue to age, their need for access to quality health care continues to grow. Today, thousands of our military retirees and their families are often going without the necessary medical care that they need and deserve because they have been shut out of the military health care system.As you may know, under the current program, military retirees who reach the age of 65 are forced out of the TRICARE Program and receive their health care services through Medicare. For many of these retirees who were promised access to military health care for their lifetime, this has been a broken promise of their faith. Many of these retirees and their families were led to believe that they would have access to military health care services if they made a career of serving their nation.Unfortunately, as the Department of Defense has drawn down and a number of military hospitals and clinics continue to close, space-available care remains elusive for most retirees. For these Medicare-eligible retirees, many of who are living on a fixed income, the prospects of costly medical care and high-priced pharmaceuticals is a scary proposition.The alternative budget proposal before us today would allow us to restore the necessary access to quality health care for military retirees over age 65 and their families. The amendment includes a provision that would incorporate the expansion of the TRICARE Senior Prime program, more commonly known as Medicare Subvention. This three-year demonstration program, which will be completed at the end of the year, has been well received by the over 65 retirees. Expansion of this program within the Department of Defense will help a number of military retirees who live near military treatment facilities.For those who may not live near a military treatment facility, the budget proposal includes funding to expand the current pharmacy benefits. Pharmacy costs for these individuals are often the largest share of health care spending. The average retiree over age 65 spends approximately $620 for prescriptions. For a retired enlisted noncommissioned officer and his family, pharmacy costs can sometimes be nearly 50 percent of their monthly income. Often these families are placed in a difficult and traumatic position of choosing between whether to purchase their prescription drugs or food on their table.The substitute amendment before us today will improve access to the TRICARE program and enhance access to care for military retirees. I hope that my colleagues will support the Spratt budget amendment and uphold our moral obligation to provide for the health care of our nation's Armed Forces.",

    "title": "EQUAL PAY DAY RESOLUTION",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a resolution with Representative Constance Morella to recognize the significance of May 11th as Equal Pay Day. May 11, 2000, is the day when women's wages for the period beginning January 1, 1999, will equal the amount earned by a man during calendar year 1999. Equal Pay Day represents the 17 months that the average woman must work to earn the same amount the average man earns in just 12 months. It is calculated according to the U.S. Census Bureau data showing a 27% wage gap in 1998.While women's participation in the labor market has increased dramatically over the last few decades, their pay has not. Women now comprise 46% of all workers, up from 33% in 1960. During this same period, federal legislation was enacted with the intent of mitigating labor market discrimination against women and others.This Equal Pay Act, mandated equal pay for men and women employed in the same or substantially same jobs in a company.The Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibited discrimination in employment and compensation against women and other protested classes of workers.Executive Order 11246 also forbade labor market discrimination and required affirmative action for protested classes of workers employed by federal contractors and subcontractors.Yes, these measures have given today's working women opportunities their mothers never had. Women now work in many different fields, each requiring different skills and experience and paying different wages. However, opening doors for working women has not closed the door on pay discrimination. Women continue to earn less than men for comparable work. U.S. Census data from 1998 shows that women earn only 73 cents for every dollar earned by men.Women get paid less because employers still discriminate in several ways.(1) Jobs usually held by women pay less than jobs traditionally held by men--even if they require the same education, skills and responsibilities.For example, stock and inventory clerks, who are mostly men, earn about $470 a week. General office clerks, on the other hand, are mostly women and they earn only $361 a week.(2) Women don't have equal job opportunities. A newly hired woman may get a lower-paying assignment than a man starting work at the same time for the same employer. That first job starts her career path and can lead to a lifetime of lower pay.(3) Women don't have an equal chance at promotions, training and apprenticeships. Because all these opportunities affect pay, women don't move up the earnings ladder as men do.Equal pay is a problem for all working women.Women lawyers--median weekly earnings are nearly $300 less than those of male attorneys--and women secretaries--who receive about $100 a week less than male clericals;Women doctors--median earnings are more than $500 less each week than men's earnings--and the 95 percent of nurses who are women but earn $30 less each week than the 5 percent of nurses who are men;Women professors--median pay is $170 less each week than men's pay--and women elementary school teachers--receive $70 less a week than men;Women food service supervisors--paid about $60 less each week than men in the same job--and waitresses--weekly earnings are $50 less than waiters' earnings. (AFL-CIO data)Every penny lost to wage inequity means fewer dollars available for women to spend on food, rent, health care, and education. So, unequal pay doesn't just affect women, it affects our entire economy. A working lifetime of diminished earnings costs the average working woman an estimated $250,000 in lost wages. Lower lifetime earnings translates into lower pension, retirement benefits and savings. As a result, women are more likely to enter retirement in poverty.By calling attention to these facts, our Equal Pay Day Resolution can heighten awareness and help create a climate in which pay discrimination can be eliminated and every person paid according to his or her worth. I am introducing this bill with 23 original cosponsors to demonstrate strong support in the U.S. House of Representatives for change across the country.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I wish to express my support for H.R. 3244, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.Trafficking in human beings is an evil which many assume was abolished long ago. Sadly, this is not the case. Human trafficking remains one of the worst human rights violations of the contemporary world. Its victims are typically the poorest, the most vulnerable and most disadvantaged. Trafficking is global in scope, fed by poverty, lawlessness, dictatorship and indifference. Each year, more than one million people, mostly women and children, are lured or forced into slavery. Traffickers buy young girls from relatives, kidnap children from their homes or lure women with false promises of legitimate employment. Traffickers use rape, starvation, torture, extreme physical brutality and psychological abuse to force victims to work in horrible conditions as prostitutes, in sweatshops or domestic servitude. Every American should be concerned and ashamed that many of these victims--perhaps numbering in the thousands--are trafficked into the United States each year.It is clear that we need stronger laws to deter trafficking. We especially need to impose disincentives to deter the international criminal rings which profit from the practice. H.R. 3244 includes these disincentives and other provisions to deter and punish traffickers by:Establishing new criminal provisions and increasing criminal and other penalties for traffickers;Establishing initiatives to prevent trafficking by educating potential victims and improving their economic conditions to decrease the lure of traffickers;Authorizing assistance for countries where victims originate to help them;Authorizing a new visa for trafficking victims and providing certain federal benefits for such victims to create a safe haven so that victims will escape their conditions and help prosecute the traffickers;Cutting off non-humanitarian assistance to countries that do not effectively combat trafficking, while providing the President a national interest waiver; andFocusing U.S. Government efforts in order to create greater interagency coordination to combat this problem.Trafficking in human beings is a shameful blot on the contemporary world. It imposes unspeakable hardship and cruelty on millions of people. I support the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, because it provides a legal framework to attack this contemporary evil. This measure deserves our support, because it affirms our adherence to universally accepted norms of human rights and it gives concrete expression to our will to defend and extend those rights.",

Today is the day when women's wages for the period beginning January 1, 1999, will equal the amount earned by a man during calendar year 1999.Since the passage of landmark legislation like the Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act, women's participation in the labor market has increased dramatically. Unfortunately, their pay has not.Women continue to earn less than men for comparable work. U.S. Census data from 1998 shows that women earn only 73 cents for every dollar earned by men.Equal pay is a problem for all working women. For example, the 95 percent of nurses who are women earn $30 less each week than the 5 percent of nurses who are men.Unequal pay doesn't just affect women, it affects our entire economy.I had hoped that I would be able to bring forward the resolution that Representative Morella and I introduced recognizing Equal Pay Day. Unfortunately, the Republican Leadership in the House refuses to acknowledge the significant effects of unequal pay on working women and their families.This Congress can do more than rest on the laurels of equal pay legislation that passed over 30 years ago. I urge all Members of Congress to commemorate Equal Pay Day. Let women in your district know that you will pursue the passage of equal pay legislation in the 106th Congress.",

But the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 is very urgent for the United States. I strongly urge my colleagues on the Committee on Rules to reconsider their decision on many amendments that do not appear before the House today.The bill before us builds upon last year's achievements and continues our efforts to improve the quality of life for our military personnel retirees and their families. I am particularly pleased that the bill includes several provisions, which I support, to improve the military health care system, particularly for our Medicare-eligible retirees and their families.This year, the Year of Health Care, we have made significant improvements in the military health care system in response to concerns raised by service members, retirees, and their families. The health care provisions of this bill will greatly improve their quality of life, particularly for Medicare-eligible retirees and their dependents.The TRICARE Senior Pharmacy Program will restore access to the National Mail Order Pharmacy, the network retail pharmacies, and the out-of-network pharmacies. It is a major step towards improving health care for our Medicare-eligible retirees. We have improved access to TRICARE. We have reduced and streamlined the administrative costs, and we are using the savings to improve health care benefits for our military personnel, retirees and their families.I am particularly pleased that this bill includes provisions which we have supported on our side of the aisle, and I am particularly pleased to have been able to work with the gentleman from Indiana (Chairman Buyer) to see that everything has been included.It includes improvements to pay, it reduces out-of-pocket housing costs for service members, and provides funding for the Military Thrift Savings Plan. These provisions help us build upon our achievements of last year, which was the Year of the Troops.Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spence), the chairman, and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton), the ranking member of the Committee on Armed Services, for their leadership in producing a bipartisan bill that will improve the lives of our service members.I particularly want to commend again the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer) for working with me and other members on the committee to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the quality of life that they deserve.",

The agreement addresses the concerns of American citizens of Vieques and assures that our training needs are met. This agreement was reached not with the protestors but with the lawful authorities in Puerto Rico.Because of the agreement, the Federal and local government enforcement officers removed the demonstrators blocking access to the training facility and the Navy is conducting training on Vieques as we speak.Now last week, the Committee on Armed Services approved language that disrupts this carefully-crafted agreement and I want to discourage my colleagues from further jeopardizing the outcome they wish to obtain regarding the Navy's presence in Vieques.Disruption would require the Vieques issue to go back to the drawing board. We should respect the hard work that has been done, and the national security interests representing the people of Vieques will be served.Further, this effort by the Congress could very well end up backfiring. Disruption of the process will inevitably bring negative consequences for the Navy, and in that ill-fated effort it kills the possibility of building a relationship between the Navy and the people of Vieques.The resolution is best accomplished by moving forward with the agreement. The Skelton amendment takes the first step towards living up to the negotiated agreement. I urge all my colleagues, particularly those on the Committee on Armed Services, to support the agreement reached by the Department of Defense and the Governor and support the Skelton amendment.",

    "title": "NATIVE HAWAIIAN HOUSING",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I express my support for the inclusion of the Hawaiian Homelands Homeownership Act, in the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act, H.R. 1776. I appreciate the leadership of Representative Rick Lazio on this bill. The Native Hawaiian housing provisions that were a part of the manager's amendment are similar to legislation that I introduced in the 105th Congress. I am hopeful that we can continue to work together to assure these important initiatives are signed by President Clinton this year.The purpose of the Hawaiian Homelands Homeownership Act is to allow access to federal housing assistance programs to Native Hawaiians who are eligible to reside on Hawaiian Home Lands but do not qualify for private mortgage loans.Although Federal housing assistance programs in Hawaii have been administered on a racially neutral basis, Native Hawaiians continue to have the greatest unmet need for housing and the highest rates of overcrowding in the United States. Forty-nine percent of Native Hawaiians experience housing problems as compared to 44 percent for American Indian and Alaska Native households and 27 percent for all other households in the United States.These troubling statistics are not recent news. In 1920, Congress enacted the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act to address Congressional findings that Native Hawaiians were a landless and distressed population. Under the Act, approximately 200,000 acres of public land that had been ceded to the United States in what was then the Territory of Hawaii would be set aside for the native people of Hawaii.When Hawaii was admitted into the Union of States in 1959, title to the 200,000 acres of land was transferred to the State of Hawaii with the requirement that the lands be held in public trust for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians. The Hawaii Admissions Act also required that the Hawaii State Constitution provide for the assumption of a trust responsibility for the lands. The lands are now administered by a State agency, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act authorized general leases of land set aside under the Act. Congress anticipated that revenues derived from general leases would be sufficient to develop the necessary infrastructure and housing on the home lands. However, general lease revenue has not proven sufficient to address infrastructure and housing needs. There are approximately 60,000 Native Hawaiians who are eligible to lease and reside on the home lands. However, due to the lack of resources to develop infrastructure (roads, access to water and sewer and electricity), hundreds of Native Hawaiians have been put on a waiting list and died before receiving an assignment of home lands.In 1995, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands published a Beneficiary Needs Study as a result of research conducted by an independent research group. This study found that among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs of those eligible to reside on the Hawaiian home lands are the most severe--with 95 percent of home lands applicants (16,000) in need of housing. Additionally, one-half of those applicant households face overcrowding and one-third pay more than 30 percent of their income for shelter.The Hawaiian Homelands Homeownership Act will help move Hawaiians into their own homes. People have spent decades on the Hawaiian waiting list. One of the obstacles that has kept people from getting homesteads has been their inability to qualify for home lands. Once this bill becomes law, they'll have access to the loans they need to attain the dream of homeownership.",

    "title": "INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE EXTENDED PAYMENT OF ESTATE TAX FOR ESTATES WITH CLOSELY HELD BUSINESSES",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, Mrs. McCarthy from New York joins me today in introducing a bill to provide estate tax relief for closely held, family-owned businesses. Both Mrs. McCarthy and I support repeal of the estate tax and we have co-sponsored legislation in this Congress, H.R. 8, to effect repeal. The Ways and Means Committee will soon mark up H.R. 8 and report the measure for floor action.The estate tax threatens the survival of family businesses. Mrs. McCarthy has heard this in her Small Business Committee, just as I have heard from my constituents. Economists and tax experts confirm that the estate tax creates a true impediment in passing the family business to the next generation. The Congressional Budget Resolution, however, prevents an immediate repeal of the estate tax, and the anticipated committee recommendation will provide rate reduction with a gradual, extended phase down of the tax.I support that recommendation as do many of my colleagues. But family-owned businesses need immediate relief if they are to survive as family enterprises. Any business owner who dies during that phase-down period, will face the problem of having to sell the business to pay the tax. Active, family-owned businesses are inherently illiquid. The owners have invested most, if not all, of their assets in the business. Where a business constitutes the major part of a person's estate, the estate must sell off the business assets, or in many cases the business itself, to pay the federal estate tax within 9 months of the owner's death.Now, sale of the business or sale of the business assets is hard to complete within 9 months. The seller is not going to get the full value of the property in a forced sale. Instead of this losing proposition, an aging parent while still living will often sell the family business even though the children want to retain the enterprise.Even the tax scholars, who argue in favor of the estate tax, agree that family businesses face a true hardship to raise cash for the estate tax. They recommend that family businesses should have an extended period to pay off the tax so that the business will not have to be sold.Trying to deal with this problem, Congress in 1958 and again in 1976 enacted the deferral and installment payment provisions in current law. Under section 6166 of the tax code, an executor of an estate can elect to defer payment of the federal estate tax for 4 years and pay the tax in annual installments over the next 10 years. The decedent's estate must pay the Treasury a discounted rate of interest on the amount of deferred tax outstanding. The 4-year deferral and 10-year installment payment apply as to the estate tax on a closely held business.This relief covers ownership of a sole proprietorship, a corporation, or a partnership. But the relief is restricted under an obsolete definition of eligibility. Back in 1948, the tax code defined a small business as having 10 or less shareholders or owners for Subchapter S treatment. In the estate tax area, relief was geared to the same definition under Subchapter S. In 1976, when Congress re-visited the estate tax, it extended the deferral and installment payment relief to businesses with 15 or less owners in keeping with the revised Subchapter S definition of small business. In 1996, Congress modified the definition of a small business under Subchapter S to mean a business with less than 75 owners, but Congress failed to make the comparable change in the estate tax. Consequently estate tax relief for closely held businesses is now based on an antiquated definition.The proposal in the bill Mrs. McCarthy and I are introducing, raises the number of permissible shareholders and partners in a qualifying business from 15 to 75 for purposes of section 6166 relief. Again, our proposal is consistent with the definition of a small business corporation in section 1361 of the tax code. Congress, in the Small Business Jobs Protection Act of 1996, had raised the permissible number of shareholders from 35 to 75 for small business corporations under section 1361, and Congress in that same bill should have made the same change for estate tax relief back in 1996.As I stated earlier, owners of closely held, family businesses have to sell their business to meet their estate tax liability. The proposed relief gives family-owned businesses as well as other closely held businesses, additional time to pay the tax. Business earnings could then be used to pay the decedent's estate tax liability without having to sell business assets or the business itself. The children could continue to own and run the family business. I commend this bill to my colleagues.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, for 1 minute, can we just set aside all of this rhetorical, divisive language about left and right and who wants to stiff-arm 2 percent or 98 percent. That is not what this is about. The whole basis of this law has changed. We have to recognize that there are middle-income businesses, small businesses all throughout this country that would benefit from a change; and we all know that there is an objection with respect to whether or not the megawealthy may or may not be able to have more advantages than they have right now.This is the first step in a legislative process, and we can be thankful to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Tanner) and the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Dunn) and to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) and to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Archer), who are excellent legislators. Everyone knows that. They will put together a package that in the end is going to achieve tax equity and fairness for the overwhelming majority of Americans who deserve it, that is going to help preserve jobs and that is going to see to it that the small businesses throughout this country and the jobs that they create are going to be preserved and protected.Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8. it is pro-jobs and pro-tax fairness, and the House should pass the bill by a wide majority.As many of you know, I have been a long time supporter of working people and their interests. It is from those perspectives that I come here today to support H.R. 8 and urge the reform of the federal estate tax law.A permanent federal estate tax was first enacted in 1916. there was clearly a revenue raising need as a result of the U.S. entering World War I. But there were also philosophical and political motives in that great fortunes had been amassed during the industrial revolution, and there was felt to be a progressive public policy objective of stopping the perpetuation and transmission of the great control that inherently accompanied vast wealth and estates.At the time, there was compelling and legitimate concern that vast fortunes, estates and trust were limiting access to capital by the emerging middle-class entrepreneurs.We are now, however, in the 21st Century. Our economy, society and means of production have radically changed. We are no longer primarily an agrarian economy, and in many ways we may be nearing the end of heavy industry phase of our economic development. The outdated laws governing industry, commerce and society of the early 20th Century must be changed to reflect the realities of the year 2000 and beyond.Capital remains a key component of business formulation and development. It is not, however, being concentrated by entities subject to the estate tax as in 1916.Irrelevant and antiquated 19th and early 20th Century laws may be a hindrance to how our society now functions. Federal estate and gift tax law fits that category.My perspective on the issue is that current law diminishes the capability of small businesses, and the jobs associated with them, to continue after the death of an owner or owners. Some studies (Heritage Foundation) have indicated that as many as 145,000 additional new jobs could be created by repeal of the estate tax law. As much as $11.0 billion in additional economic output could result. The preservation and expansion of smaller, family businesses will protect jobs, and generate and expand the number of new jobs.For example, I represent the State of Hawaii, a state dominated by small businesses. Plantation agriculture has virtually ended and with the demise and economic dislocation associated with economic change, we are working hard to diversify Hawaii agriculture. This means many more smaller scale farmers growing specialty and niche crops instead of millions of tons of sugar. The middle class in Hawaii has developed from small business origins, and we now have great hope that a new generation of entrepreneurs will help sustain the economy through the new farming opportunities available for the first time in generations. I want to help preserve and develop those elements in Hawaii and in the American economy and society that generate millions of jobs.Regarding tax fairness, an equally compelling case is made that the wealthiest do not pay their fair share of estate taxes. The Tax Code has deliberately been riddled with exemptions and exceptions that are ruthlessly and thoroughly exploited by tax attorneys specializing in the preservation of inherited wealth. There is an entire body of tax law devoted to estate and gift tax avoidance and minimalization.Tax attorneys, I assure you, are talented and hard-working. The result is the majority of estates paying estate taxes are valued at $5.0 million and less. These are not the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Carnegies and J.P. Morgan robber barons the 1916 law was enacted to curb. Huge fortunes have for generations been sheltered with sophisticated, complex tax machinations. It is family farm and small businesses owners who are being penalized when trying to pass down assets to new generations to keep middle-class businesses in operation and generating employment. I can assure you I know of no small businesses in Kaneohe, Makiki, Waianae or Mililani, Hawaii that resort to multi-generation skipping trusts in order to keep a bakery or a delivery service in operation.Lastly, there is a human element in this debate that must be noted. One of my constituents, Steve Lee, is an estate attorney and planner in Honolulu. Mr. Lee's father inherited a few apartments from his parents some time ago. Mr. Lee's grandparents worked hard for years, acquiring the apartments as a means of assuring retirement income. Now his father is spending hours trying to figure our how to keep the property intact to pass it along to Mr. Lee and his brother. The Lees are middle-income in Hawaii. The value of real property acquired years ago, however, has been greatly inflated and the Lee brothers will face the need to liquidate at least part of the property in order to pay estate taxes in 9 months. The Lees justifiably feel they are being penalized for having kept their property intact within their family.Mr. Speaker, our current estate tax fails to meet the goals we expect. It is overly complex to the point of being arcane, the burden on those upon whom it falls is unfair and inefficient.Passing H.R. 8 today is the first major step. As we move through the legislative process, however, we will also seriously consider proposals that would provide interim, transitional relief. We will seriously consider any inequities that total elimination might engender. We will address Presidential objections. We can forge a bill acceptable to all who want tax equity.Consequently, I look on H.R. 8 as both tax fairness, and pro-jobs and I am pleased to be associated with John Tanner, Jennifer Dunn, Bill Archer, Eva Clayton and others in helping move estate tax reform legislation through Congress.I urge the House to pass the bill, and bring more fairness to the Tax Code.",

Those trustees are no longer in place. The argument that he has had with the Bishop Estate no longer applies. Not one single penny, as he well knows, goes to the Bishop Estate.Why the gentleman from Ohio has this obsession to come to Hawaii, why he has the time to leave his district in Ohio and try to come to the floor of this House to act on behalf of Hawaiian children, I do not know. But I do know that his characterization to my colleagues is something that I take great offense at, because not one penny for these children is going to either those trustees or into that estate.The people who are handling the funds that my colleagues have put forward in this bill are the University of Hawaii at Hilo, the Leeward Community College, the Maui Community College, the Kauai Community College, the Hawaii Community College, and four Hawaiian nonprofit organizations, none of whom have anything to do with the Bishop Estate.Now, if my colleagues want to make this into a Republican versus Democratic issue, I most emphatically plead with them, do not do this. This is an educational issue that everyone in every district here can relate to on the basis of what is good for the children of one's district.This is not a partisan issue unless the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner) is able to make it that and unless he is able to convince my colleagues against the evidence that this has something to do with the estate with which he has had an argument in the past.Every issue raised by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner) with respect to the estate has been addressed. Every single issue now is moot.So I plead with all the Members, Democrat or Republican here, to trust the judgment in this instance of Democrats and Republicans alike, leaders on both sides, and a plea from me and the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink) that my colleagues allow us, as we do for any Member in this House, to trust us as we trust them to address the particular circumstances in their districts that require congressional attention.I ask the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner) not to make this an issue that would divide this House along partisan lines and to recognize that his arguments have been met, his arguments have been addressed.Kamehameha Schools assists with the development of the needs assessment and targets programming to these needs. From the 1999 report, the most severe needs continue to be school readiness, basic skills, high school completion, and college enrollment and completion. Efforts to address these needs must begin with the very young, and it must integrate the language, culture, and values of the Native Hawaiian people.In May 1999, the courts appointed a new Board of Trustees for the Bishop Estate. The interim trustees have moved swiftly to approve new policies and initiatives which have already changed the direction of Kam Schools in very constructive ways. The Board has held many town meetings to undertake strategic planning with all stakeholders.The direction of Kam Schools for the next 10 or 15 years will spend more on education and try to reach more Hawaiians and form more community partnerships. Another major change--giving the Hawaiian community more of a say in how the trust is run--has already begun with the strategic planning process. The draft was formed from more than 3,000 comments and suggestions the estate has solicited from the public since August. Kam Schools currently serves 961 preschool age children, 1,000 elementary school students on three islands, and 2,482 students attending high school on Oahu. They plan to increase the education spending from $100 million annually to $159 million in the next budget.Since May 1999, the following changes have occurred:Reorganized the Education Group, so all instructional and support programs report directly to the President;Began leveraging of Kamehameha's resources through partnerships to expand programs;Developed a K-3 reading program with DOE for DOE classrooms;Expanded Pre-schools for three-year oldsApproved parenting program focusing on infants and toddlers.The NHEA was enacted in 1988. Its objective is to raise the educational status of Native Hawaiians (whose needs are documented below) through the provision of supplemental programs and services for curriculum development, pre-school education, gifted and talented programs, special education initiatives, and the provision of higher education. The Act was amended in 1994 and expanded to include the establishment of community-based learning center, a curriculum development and teacher training component, and the establishment of a statewide Native Hawaiian Education Council and individual island councils.(Sec. 9204) Native Hawaiian Education Council and Island Councils(Sec. 9205) Native Hawaiian Family-Based Education Centers(Sec. 9206) Native Hawaiian Higher Education Program(Sec. 9207) Native Hawaiian Gifted and Talented Program(Sec. 9208) Native Hawaiian Special Education Program(Sec. 9209) Native Hawaiian Curriculum Development, Teacher Training, and Recruitment Program(Sec. 9210) Native Hawaiian Community-Based Education Learning Centers(Other grantees include the University of Hawaii at Hilo, Leeward Community College, Maui Community College, Kauai Community College, Hawaii Community College, Pihana Na Mamo, Alu Like, Inc., Pulama I Na Keiki, Aha Punana Leo)(1) Native Hawaiian Higher Education Program$1.036 million program funding--last year served 91 students.provide financial assistance and direction to Native Hawaiian students seeking postsecondary education--also requires a community service commitment(2) Kamehameha Talent Search$303,201 program funding--competitively granted--last year served 800 public schools studentsassist students who may be first in family to graduate from a secondary school to enroll in postsecondary educational programs$882,000 program funding--last year served 12,369 individualsestablish Safe and Drug Free Schools to reduce violence and substance abuseDuring the October 1999 markup of a section of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization, Representative Boehner offered his amendment to repeal the program. He stated:His comments would focus on Bishop Estate, its mission, its history of scandal, its budget, and potential for success with the recent reformsHe said there are 15,000 Native Hawaiian children in Hawaii--Patsy corrected him with Census data in her testimony, stating that there are actually 47,282.He said Bishop Estate was worth $10 billion and they own 10% of Goldman Sachs, numerous Hawaii hotels, Las Vegas casinos, and shopping centers. Kamehameha Schools budget data reflects a net worth closer to $5 billion.He said that the former trustees were involved in kickback schemes, mail fraud, drug use, and improper credit card use, but their biggest fault was their $1 million annual compensation. He also mentioned the continuing probe of the estate's activities by the IRS and the State courts.He said that there are 3,200 students in Kamehameha Schools and that only one-eighth of those that apply are accepted. Patsy corrected him that there are actually 5,000 children attending Kam Schools--my statistics show that the number is 4,444 kids.He also made a point that the Estate should try using their interest income on educating Native Hawaiian children. That would raise the amount they spend by $400 million annually.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Army for 225 years of service to our Nation, and I would like to have it recorded that I would like to join in with my chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer), with his words. I thought they were very eloquent and to the point, and I am happy indeed to be able to associate myself with them.The United States Army created the year before the Declaration of Independence was signed, has for over 200 years courageously fought this Nation's wars and ensured peace and prosperity. The sacrifices of our men and women in uniform have brought freedom, not just for our country, but also for many others throughout the world.Particularly, in my own State of Hawaii, the Army has a proud history. On December 7, 1941, the soldiers of the 25 Infantry Division had the distinction of being the first Army soldiers to see combat in World War II when they fired on Japanese aircraft strafing Schofield Barracks during the attack on Pearl Harbor.After the attack, the 25th quickly set up its defensive positions to protect Honolulu and Pearl Harbor against possible Japanese attack.I must also mention the heroism during World War II of the legendary 442nd Regimental Combat Team and the 100th Infantry Battalion. Comprised of Asian-Americans, these two units performed with great valor and courage during the Europe campaign. Already, two of the most highly decorated units in the Army, the bravery of these soldiers will again be recognized when President Clinton on June 21 awards 19 medals of honor later this month for their courage during World War II.While the Army can justifiably be proud of its history, it is also fearlessly looking to the future. The Army is demonstrating remarkable flexibility by transforming itself in a new fighting force that will be able to win on the battlefield tomorrow, whether that means urban combat in remote parts of the world or peacekeeping in a war-ravaged country.The capability the Army provides continues to be an important and integral part of our ability to ensure the peace and security of our Nation. But the commitment of our military personnel does not come without peril and price. Duty often calls for prolonged periods away from family and home.Today, Mr. Speaker, we recognize the sacrifice of those whose dedication and devotion to duty ensure the blessings of freedom every day.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Hefley) for yielding.Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2722, which is before the House today authorizing the Medal of Honor for James K. Okubo, Ed. W. Freeman, and Andrew J. Smith for the heroic actions as outlined by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Hefley).These three individuals are highly deserving of this award for their conspicuous bravery under fire in the defense of our great nation.I am particularly pleased that this legislation is the culmination of an exhaustive effort to recognize James K. Okubo for his valor during World War II. Mr. Okubo, a Japanese-American, originally from Washington State, like hundreds of others was sent to an internment camp in California at the outset of World War II. Despite being subjected to this shameful treatment, he never wavered in his patriotism and dedication to this country.James Okubo entered the Army and was assigned as a medic in the legendary 442nd Regimental Combat Team. In October of 1944, Technician Okubo and his unit were tasked with the rescue of the ``Lost Battalion'' from Texas. The ``Lost Battalion'' was surrounded by German forces and threatened with annihilation.During a 2 day period of heavy machine gun fire, mortar and artillery fire, Technician Okubo provided first-aid to 25 fellow soldiers wounded in the battle. On two occasions he crawled within yards of enemy lines to evacuate wounded comrades. Later during the battle he ran 75 yards through withering machine gun fire directed at him and evacuated a seriously wounded crewman from a burning tank.For his heroism displayed during these intense combat situations, Technician Okubo was recommended for the Medal of Honor. I think it is important to note that, Mr. Speaker, he was recommended at that time for the Medal of Honor. However, the award was downgraded with the explanation that since he was a medic, Technician Okubo was not eligible for any award higher than the Silver Star.Sadly, Mr. Okubo passed away in 1967 without ever receiving the proper recognition he rightly deserves. However, we now have the opportunity to correct this injustice. Mr. Okubo's case has recently been reviewed, as the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Hefley) indicated, by the Department of the Army under Section 1130 of Title X. After a thorough review of the facts of the case, the Army determined that Mr. Okubo in fact deserves to be awarded the Medal of Honor recommended for him for his valor during World War II.On June 21, the President will be recognizing 12 members of Mr. Okubo's former unit, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. These individuals have also earned the Nation's highest award, the Medal of Honor.I strongly urge the House to join our colleagues in the Senate and pass S. 2722, so that James K. Okubo can be honored with his comrades on this momentous occasion.Mr. Speaker, may I conclude and thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Hefley) again personally on this floor for not only his interest, but his dedication, and thank in particular Mike Higgins and Phil Grone, Ashley Godwin and Deborah Watta for making it possible for the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Hefley) and myself to appear on the floor in such an expeditious manner. They have done a terrific job with this, Mr. Speaker, and I am very grateful. I thank the gentleman for yielding.",

It is her intent that this funding be used to support the Hawaii Longline Fisheries Observer Program, a threatened program absolutely essential to fisheries in the Pacific. The observer program is used to ensure that the longlining industry in the Pacific is not capturing, through incidental take, rare and endangered species such as leatherback sea turtles. NMFS has stated that it is mandatory that the observer program be in place to monitor the longline fishery, yet has cut this program from 13 to 2 people because of budget shortfalls. A proposed lawsuit threatens to close down the fishery entirely without observers, and we can not allow this to happen. We need to get the observers back on the boats where they belong! The Western Pacific Fishery Management Council has been supportive of the observer program as it provides important data needed for effective management. It is my understanding that the proposed budget includes funding for other observer programs, but that the Hawaiian longline observer program is sorely neglected. I urge support of this program by Congress in order to correct this oversight as a matter of fairness to fisheries in the Pacific.",

    "title": "AMERICAN SHIPBUILDERS CRUISE INTO A NEW MILLENNIUM",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker. On June 30, 2000, Litton Ingalls Shipbuilding cut steel on the first cruise ship to be built in the United States in nearly 45 years. This historic event marks another milestone in the U.S.-flag Cruise Ship Pilot Project, enacted as part of the MARITECH program in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 1998, and represents America's re-entry into the burgeoning cruise travel market.People have been saying for years that America cannot build ships competitively on the world market. The construction of the two cruise ships for American Classic Voyages Co. at Litton Ingalls Shipbuilding demonstrates that America can build ships competitively on the world market. At a fixed price of $440 million a piece, the ships are only slightly above the price being charged for cruise ship construction in European yards, where nearly all new cruise ships are built. The price of the America ships would be even more competitive in the world market if the worldwide ship construction subsidies were eliminated.The cruise industry is one of the fastest growing segments of the travel and leisure industry, growing at a pace of about nine percent annually. Loopholes in U.S. laws and regulations have essentially ceded this burgeoning vacation business to companies operating cruise ships under flags-of-convenience. With the exception of the single U.S.-flag oceangoing cruise ship operating in my State of Hawaii, there are no U.S.-flag oceangoing passenger liners. The U.S.-flag Cruise Ship Pilot Project, enacted to help jumpstart the U.S.-flag cruise industry, will change that and will give Americans a foothold in a cruise industry now dominated by foreign cruise lines.The revitalization of the American cruise business is vital to our economic and national security. The Department of Defense has stated that the Pilot Project alone could save it ``tens to hundreds of millions of dollars'' in shipyard overhead costs. It also helps to sustain the shipbuilding industrial base of the U.S., which is vital to national security. The thousands of jobs created will help maintain the manpower necessary for building and crewing ships in times of national emergencies. The Department of Defense has also expressed an interest in utilizing the hull designs for cruise ships for command and control vessels in the future.Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see a resurgence of interest in the U.S.-flag cruise business. At least three companies have publicly expressed a desire to build U.S.-flag cruise ships in a U.S. shipyard for the American cruise market. Future construction in this area will improve the worldwide competitiveness of U.S. shipyards, and Litton Ingalls Shipbuilding is leading the way for America's re-entry into this growing marketplace. These efforts are important to the future of the U.S. shipbuilding industry, a U.S.-flag maritime industry, and our national security.I am looking forward to the day when American Classic begins operating these new ships in Hawaii, bringing with it thousands of seagoing and shoreside jobs. Projects such as this will help renew America's leadership in commercial ship construction and in the cruise industry. I hope that Congress will do all it can to help revitalize this vital American industry.",

Res. 549 introduced by my colleagues the gentleman from California (Mr. Gallegly), whom I am very happy to see on the floor today, and the co-chair of the Reserve and Guard Caucus the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor), who is also with us, which recognizes the 10th anniversary of the National Guard and Reserves in Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield.H. Res. 549 acknowledges the contribution of the more than 267,000 members of the National Guard and Reserves that were ordered to active duty to serve or support operations. Their activation and participation In Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm was a historic chapter in our nation's effort to achieve a total integrated force.Although the United States and its allied forces overwhelmed the Iraqi opposition, Operation Desert Storm and Operation Desert Shield were not bloodless. Fifty-seven members of the National Guard and Reserves lost their lives in service. As we recognize the 10th anniversary of the contributions of the National Guard and Reserve to Operation Desert Storm and Operation Desert Shield, let us also remember and honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect our nation.From enforcing the no-fly zone over Northern Iraq to supporting activities of Southern Watch, Guard and Reservists continue to support military operations in Southwest Asia. With 47 percent of the Army's combat support service units in the Reserves, the Guard and Reserves are increasingly becoming vital to the security of our country.As President Clinton recently said, the ``reserves are essential to America's military strength; they are part of the total force we bring to bear whenever our men and women in uniform are called to action.'' In the years following the activation for the Desert Shield and Desert Storm the country has called upon its Reservists repeatedly.In Haiti we called some 8,000 to active duty. For peacekeeping operations in Bosnia, we have called over 19,000 to date, and with volunteers, we have cycled over 32,000 Guard and Reserve members through Bosnia.Mr. Speaker, we will continue to call upon them. The bottom line is that today we simply cannot undertake sustained operations anywhere in the world without the Guard and Reserve.Let me pay tribute to the 267,000 Guard and Reservists who served during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm as we recognize the 10th anniversary of their activation, and thank the 1.3 million Ready Reservists who are currently serving for their dedication and sacrifice.",

    "title": "EXPRESSING POLICY OF UNITED STATES REGARDING ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH NATIVE HAWAIIANS",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, before I yield time to my colleague from Hawaii, may I thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Hansen), in particular, and the rest of the members of the committee, both Republican and Democrat, for their support of the bill; and may I express yet once again publicly to my chairman, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), my profound gratitude for his understanding, his concern and his perseverance, dedication and focus on this bill.Mr. Speaker, I am here today to urge the House of Representatives' approval of H.R. 4904, a bill to provide a process for the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian government and the recognition by the United States of the Native Hawaiian government.On January 17, 1893, the government of the Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown with the assistance of the United States Minister and U.S. Marines. One hundred years later, a resolution extending an apology on behalf of the United States to Native Hawaiians for the illegal overthrow of the Native Hawaiian government and calling for a reconciliation of the relationship between the United States and Native Hawaiians was enacted to law.The Apology Resolution acknowledges that the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States. Further, it acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over the their national lands to the United States, either through their government or through a plebiscite or referendum.Since the loss of their government, Native Hawaiians have sought to maintain political authority within their community. In 1978, Hawaii citizens of all races recognized the long-standing efforts of the indigenous people to give expression to their rights to self-determination and self-governance by amending the state constitution to provide for the establishment of a quasi-sovereign state agency, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. The state constitution provides that the Office is to be governed by nine Native Hawaiian trustees who are elected by Native Hawaiians. The Office of Hawaiian Affairs administers programs and services with revenues derived from lands which were ceded back to the State of Hawaii upon its admission into the United States. The dedication of these revenues reflects the provisions of the 1959 Hawaii Admissions Act, which provides that the ceded lands and the revenues derived therefrom should be held by the State of Hawaii as a public trust for five purposes--one of which is the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians. The Admissions Act also provides that the state would assume a trust responsibility for approximately 203,500 acres of land that had previously been set aside for Native Hawaiians under a 1921 federal law, the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act.Four weeks ago, the House Resources Committee and the Senate Indian Affairs Committee held five days of joint hearings in Hawaii on H.R. 4904 and its companion in the Senate, S. 2899. More than 150 people presented oral testimony to the committees and several hundred others presented written testimony. The testimony received by the committees was overwhelmingly in support of the bills. In addition to witnesses from the Native Hawaiian community, representatives of the Departments of Justice and Interior, the President of the National Congress of American Indians, the President of the Alaska Federation of Natives, and the President of the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indians presented oral testimony in support of the bills.With the passage of H.R. 4904, the Congress will provide a process for the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian government, and the recognition by the United States of that government for purposes of carrying on a government-to-government relationship. This bill provides that the indigenous, native people of Hawaii--Native Hawaiians--might have the same opportunities that are afforded under federal law and policy to the other indigenous, native people of the United States--American Indians and Alaska Natives--to give expression to their rights to self-determination and self-governance.It is also important to note that the United States Congress has enacted over 160 laws designed to address the conditions of Native Hawaiians. These federal laws provide for the provision of health care, education, job training, the preservation of native languages, the protection of Native American graves and the repatriation of Native American human remains. Thus, the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian government would not necessitate a host of new federal programs to serve Native Hawaiians. Nor would the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian government have any impact on programs or the funding for programs that are authorized to address the conditions of American Indians and Alaska Natives. For the last 90 years, Native Hawaiian programs have always been funded under separate authorizations with separate appropriations.Some have asked whether the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian government might also authorize that government to conduct gaming. The answer to that question is a simple ``no.'' The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act authorizes Indian tribal governments to conduct gaming on Indian reservations or Indian lands held in trust by the United States, and the scope of gaming under the act is a function of state law. But there are no Indian tribal governments in Hawaii, nor are there Indian reservations or Indian lands. And the State of Hawaii is one of two states in the union that criminally prohibit all forms of gaming.In developing and refining this measure, we have worked not only with the a community, but with representatives of the federal and state governments, with leaders of the Alaska Native and Native American communities, and with the congressional caucuses. The bill that is before the House today has been revised as a result of the testimony received at the hearings in Hawaii and in Washington, D.C.Our objectives are simple and straightforward. As a matter of federal policy and federal law, we want to assure that the United States government deals with all of the indigenous, native people of the United States in a consistent manner--recognizing and supporting their rights to self-determination and self-governance. This is the right thing to do and I am honored to play a part in the passage of this measure. I ask my colleagues for their support.Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink).(Mrs. MINK of Hawaii asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)",

    "title": "PROVIDING FOR VOTING IN MILITARY INSTALLATIONS",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise reluctantly in opposition to One important component of U.S. foreign policy is the promotion of democracies world-wide. Each time the U.S. supports a fledgling democracy, we insist on a clear decoupling of the civilian leadership and a nation's military. We insist that the military subsume itself to civilian control by elected officials. This principle is as important today as it was to our Founders. Because of the strength of that principle I must stand in strong opposition to the measure before us today. Protection of this enduring principle requires adherence to established procedures.There is a longstanding tradition of avoiding the politicization of military bases. Polling activity brings with it electioneering, and that activity on a military base is clearly inappropriate.Military personnel vote at their home of record. For most, this means that they vote through absentee ballot. There is no indication that military personnel are currently disenfranchised, and that this measure would be necessary.There may be legal considerations regarding the assignment of precincts and other state election laws. These may conflict with federal considerations.The addition of new polling places may require that the states provide new balloting machines. There is no funding for this under this measure, and may therefore present the states with an unfunded mandate. Many of our bases are open bases with free access to civilians. However, some bases are not for national security and/or force protection reasons. It is unclear how this bill would affect those concerns.In addition, the Department of Defense is opposed to this provision. This provision deserves to be taken through the normal committee process, and not be considered under suspension of the rules.Most Important: There have been no hearings on this measure. Many questions, such as those above, should be fully investigated through the committee hearing process before this bill is brought to the floor.A citizen's right to vote is the linchpin of our democracy, therefore nothing should be held in higher regard nor given more deference. This bill should be afforded a full and comprehensive review by the entire Congress through established procedures. Anything short of that is irresponsible and borders on weakening the time-tested foundations of democracy.Mr. Speaker, I include additional material for the Record.The Department of Defense has a standing policy prohibiting the use of federal, active military and reserve facilities as polling or voting places. The Department believes that the military should not be involved in any way in the electoral process, in order to avoid the possibility or the perception of voter coercion or intimidation by military personnel or a military presence, or the perception that the military has authority over the election process. The principle that the military should remain separated from the electoral process is reflected in existing laws imposing criminal penalties on commanders who station troops or armed men at any place where a special or general election is held, and on members of the Armed Forces who impose regulations on the conduct of such elections or otherwise interfere in any manner with an election officer's discharge of his duties. See 18 U.S.C. 592, 593. Locating polling places on military installations, where a commander's authority is paramount, in inconsistent with DoD policy and runs the risk of exposing military personnel to criminal sanctions.Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton).(Mr. SKELTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)",

I believe it is an act, if you will, of self-preservation of a democracy, certainly our democracy. Because free speech is so important, I think the gentleman is quite correct in observing that it is unlikely that commanders would like to have political activity, sign-holding, et cetera, very near a polling place if it was in the middle of a base.I expect different jurisdictions across the Nation have different rules with respect to how close to a voting booth one can actually politic, but nonetheless, it is unlikely that military bases would find themselves easily resolving those kinds of questions.My point, in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, is that while this is an idea that certainly should receive full discussion and consideration, passing it at this time has not allowed for that.

And I must say in conclusion, that it just seemed perfectly natural to me when the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett) came up and asked for my support that he would be leading the charge on this particular piece of legislation.It is a pleasure to be working with him and to have the opportunity to join with him in supporting this bill.Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5314, introduced by my friend and Armed Services Committee colleague, Mr. Roscoe Bartlett. The bill before the House today would terminate the Department of Defense policy of putting down aging military working dogs and provide for their adoptionCurrently, there is no policy to allow these elderly dogs to be retired and transferred to an individual or private entity that could provide appropriate care for these aging dogs.H.R. 5314 would address this unfortunate situation and allow elderly military working dogs to be adopted by law enforcement agencies, former handlers, and other persons capable of humanely caring for these fine animals. The bill also includes a provision that limits the Federal Government's liability in cases where a former military working dog is transferred.H.R. 5314 allows the commander of the individual dog's unit to decide whether a particular military working dog is suitable for adoption. This will afford military working dogs the same treatment given to those dogs who serve on our community police forces, and allow military working dogs to retire and enjoy the last few years of their life.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",

While he will step down as chairman next year, I know that he will continue to contribute to the committee's efforts to improve the quality of life for our service members and their families and provide for a strong national defense.I would also like to acknowledge the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton), the ranking member, for his guidance and leadership. Both individuals have placed the security of our country above partisan struggle and have continued the committee's tradition of bipartisanship and cooperation.As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, I am proud to say that the conference agreement before us includes quite a list of accomplishments in the personnel arena. We are sending a strong signal to the men and women in uniform that we have listened to their concerns about their need to provide for a quality of life for themselves and their families, and we have taken the steps to address those concerns.I also am particularly pleased that a number of health care provisions that I proposed have been adopted. I want to recognize the efforts of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel chairman, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer), for his dedication and commitment to improving the lives of our service members.Working together, and I want to emphasize that point, Mr. Speaker, working together, we have made major strides in providing for our service members, retirees, and their families.Finally, I would like to thank the full committee staff and, in particular, the Subcommittee on Military Personnel staff, including Debra Wada, Nancy Warner, John Chapla, Mike Higgins and Ed Eyatt. It is a terrific team, Mr. Speaker, one that this body can be proud of; and it exemplifies the kind of staff work that the entire community of people throughout the United States can be proud of. The scope of their assistance is immeasurable.Let me conclude, Mr. Speaker, by referring to one of the most important aspects of the bill, which is the promise that we keep our Medicare-eligible military retirees to restore access to lifetime military health care. The gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer) has gone into this in some detail.The conference agreement allows the Medicare-eligible retirees who are currently forced out of the system when they turn 65 to continue their coverage under TRICARE. Mr. Speaker, I realize I am at the end of my remarks, but I would like to emphasize as I close that the bipartisanship that we have enjoyed I hope will continue regardless of what happens in November, and I for one am pledged to it.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is with deep admiration that I rise to express gratitude and respect for the sacrifices given of the men and women serving on board the U.S.S. Cole.Speaking as the senior Democrat on the Subcommittee on Military Personnel of the Committee on Armed Services, I want to indicate that these men and women, like thousands of other Americans across the world, volunteered each and every day to defend and protect this Nation. Sadly, on October 12, several sailors of the U.S.S. Cole paid the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our country while carrying out their duties. My heart and prayers are with these sailors' friends, families and loved ones.Despite the explosion that ripped through the U.S.S. Cole and wounded many members of the crew, these dedicated sailors continue to defend their ship and rescue other wounded shipmates. Their actions exemplify the perseverance of Americans and the finest tradition of our Armed Services.I want to commend and pay tribute to these selfless Americans for their service and dedication and wish them a speedy recovery.Mr. Speaker, terrible events such as these put a face to patriotism. They remind us that those in uniform around the world are young men and women from our towns and cities who volunteer in service to their country. Last year, they graduated from high school down the street; perhaps they worked at the corner store. Today they unflinchingly stare danger in the face with selfless dedication.This tragedy reminds us of the human element of our armed forces and highlights the importance of maintaining a focus on those policies that best serve these young patriots, our military personnel, and enhance the quality of their lives.Finally, this tragedy offers a window into the composition of today's military. I want to quote, Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, a piece from yesterday's Boston Globe: ``The faces of the 17 sailors who were killed aboard the U.S.S. Cole by a terrorist bomb attack last week are a portrait of today's America, a mosaic of colors of which the U.S. military is justly proud. To call out their given names is to sing a contemporary chorus of `This Land is Your Land.' Two of the casualties even represent a grim kind of civil rights milestone: They are the first women killed in naval action.''Mr. Speaker, the crew of the U.S.S. Cole embodies what is great in America--our people and their courage, dedication, commitment, and sacrifice. To the crew of the U.S.S. Cole, their families, friends and loved ones, thank you for your service to a most grateful nation.",

    "title": "HAWAII WATER RESOURCES ACT OF 2000",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I support S. 1694, the Hawaii Water Resources Development Act and urge its passage.The legislation authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to undertake a study of the reclamation and reuse of water and wastewater in Hawaii. The Bureau is to survey irrigation and water delivery systems, identifying the costs of rehabilitating systems and evaluating future water demand.Much of Hawaii is experiencing a major drought. Sugar, long the dominant agricultural product of Hawaii, is rapidly ending as a viable commercial enterprise, freeing vast quantities of water previously devoted to irrigation. Both factors result in the need to determine prudent use of existing water resources to meet future demands.In the last 10 years, 96 sugar farms and plantations have closed and only two substantial plantations remain in commercial production. Over 130,000 of 180,000 acres previously in sugar cane production is now idle. Although economic dislocations have resulted, it also affords Hawaii the first opportunity in more than a century to diversify the agricultural sector of our economy. Diversified agriculture is now growing at 5.5% annual rate, surpassing $300 million in value. Vast tracts of some of the most productive land in the world, however, remain empty and idle. The availability of water will be a key factor in determining how these lands will be used for generations to come.The present water resources transportation and irrigation systems began in 1856 and now involve some of the most extensive and hydraulically complex systems in the world, involving tunnels blasted through mountains, open ditches, syphons and channels carrying water from the wetter sides of the islands to the interior and leeward sides for irrigation. Because of declining use, these facilities, engineering marvels of their time, are falling into disrepair. There may also be opportunities to restore traditional watersheds. But in all cases, it is essential that a comprehensive study be undertaken to assess our current needs and resources before these crucial decisions are made. Under all existing and projected scenarios, water usage will remain high.Many see Hawaii as a lush paradise filled with unique sights and recreational opportunities. It certainly is all of those, but it would be fewer of those things without water, which is not abundant in many parts of the islands. Prior to 1856, what is now some of the most fertile and productive land in the world was arid due to the geological characteristics of the Hawaiian Islands whereby most of the rain falls in the mountain ranges and windward sides, leaving the interior and leeward sides often sparse in rainfall. S. 1694, initiated by Senator Akaka, authorizes an important study, focusing on opportunities for water reuse, recycling, reclamation and conservation of water and wastewater for agriculture and non-agriculture uses.It is essential to the future of generations to come to Hawaii that wise decisions on water conservation and allocation be made. Enactment of S. 1694 is a major step in that direction and I urge passage of the bill.",

    "title": "PROMOTION OF ADOPTION OF MILITARY WORKING DOGS",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5314 as passed by the Senate. The bill before the House today promotes the adoption of military working dogs at the end of their useful working life as the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett) indicated or if the dog is otherwise excess to the needs of the Department.Currently, the Department of Defense does not have a policy to allow these elderly dogs to be retired and transferred to an individual or a private entity that could provide appropriate care for the aging dogs.H.R. 5314 would address this unfortunate situation and allow elderly military working dogs to be adopted by law enforcement agencies, former handlers, and other persons capable of humanely caring for these honorable military animals. The bill also includes a provision that limits the Federal Government's liability in cases where a former military working dog is transferred.H.R. 5314 provides military working dogs the same rights as dogs that serve in our community police forces.Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett) for his leadership in this issue. When first examined, Mr. Speaker, it seems to be something which might not necessarily be superfluous but something which, on the surface, is something that people do not even have any idea that the situation was occurring.I think people just assume quite naturally that, after a useful working life, that animals would be taken care of in a fashion other than having their lives ended. The gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett) took the lead on this, and I want to thank him for it.I think people all across the country, and I can tell my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, for sure, once folks in my district found out that I was working with the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett) on this, let me know in no uncertain terms that they wanted this bill to pass. If for no other reason, Mr. Speaker, if I could address the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett) directly, I want to tell him he is a new hero to my wife; and he most certainly can count on my support as a result for his concern for these loyal working military animals.So with that, Mr. Speaker, I urge most vehemently my colleagues to support this measure and congratulate the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett), not only for his leadership on the issue, but for exhibiting yet once again his concern for all elements of military issues coming before our committee. It is an honor to serve with him.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, for those who do not think about this every day when they get up, this debate may seem rather esoteric and a bit almost beside the point; but for those of our constituents who are concerned about this issue, let me tell my colleagues, they think about it every day. They think about it all the time. They think about it in terms that are very, very personal to them.I do not think that I have ever involved myself with a domestic issue that has had the same kind of impact personally, psychologically, and emotionally as this issue has had with my constituents. People that I have known personally in the islands for the better part of four decades, many of whom have not agreed with me philosophically, ideologically in terms of politics are united around this issue. And the fact that it may not provide every aspect, every element that they would like to see in terms of immediacy; the fact that they will have to come to grips with capital gains taxation that they might not otherwise have anticipated; and the fact that they understand that this bill is in a process of becoming that what passes today is unlikely to be the final answer, that some of the immediacy that is involved in the substitute that the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) and others have put together in good faith may become part of the equation.Those facts, yes, enter into it; but fundamentally, what they want is the passage of this bill, and they want to be able to see and say who is on their side on this. And I am afraid that our substitute, the amendment, as such, despite its good intentions, will not measure in that regard.The other aspect of this that is very, very important and what hit me so hard is that this is a jobs bill. We tend not to look at that aspect of it. Businesses which have to be sold in order to meet the estate tax burden involve dozens, sometimes hundreds of people whose jobs, whose welfare, whose obligations, whose responsibilities are put in jeopardy. I do not think we can do that.This is involved with families. This is involved in a way that people have a tremendous emotional commitment to, and I think as Democrats and Republicans we need to respond to it with an overwhelming vote in favor of the estate tax repeal.",

    "title": "UNITED STATES MISSILE DEFENSE",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, with the President making his remarks today on missile defense, I think we need to recognize unprecedented political challenges loom on the strategic horizon. Current U.S. defense force planning is set within an atmosphere of great uncertainty. Historic rivals of the United States, such as the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc nations, have either disintegrated altogether or lost much of their competitive influence.Regional state actors, particularly on the Asian continent, show signs of future ascendancy on the world political stage. Other nation states, some exhibiting anti-U.S. bent, continue to challenge American allies and interests around the world, even as U.S. peacekeeping and peacemaking commitments evolve.The very definition of American interests is in transition as varied threats emerge in the post-Cold War world.International corruption, organized crime, and the production, trade, and trafficking of illicit narcotics is on the rise. These transnational threats contribute to the instability of political systems abroad, the violation of U.S. borders, and often represent a threat to social conditions in the United States.The threat of terrorism, both state and non-state sponsored, has grown in significance and Americans have increasingly become targets for attackers abroad. According to a December 2000 unclassified Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report, terrorist attacks against the United States, its forces, facilities, and interests overseas are expected to increase over the next decade. Additionally the report states, ``Between now and 2015 terrorist tactics will become increasingly sophisticated and designed to achieve mass casualities.'' This potential threat is of particular concern for the United States with its open borders, emphasis on local--and perhaps uncoordinated--emergency responders, and a prevalent cultural respect for civil liberties, and, thus, freedom of movement and action. Antiterrorist measures must address all plausible attack scenarios, including the delivery of an explosive device by more traditional means, such as by ship, rail, foot, or automotive vehicle.The availability of advanced technologies has also reached a significant level of concern as Russia, China, and North Korea, continue to exhibit ambivalent attitudes towards nonproliferation agreements.The 2001 Report of the Secretary of Defense to the President and the Congress notes the spread of materials with potential applications to nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, and highlights the proliferation of advanced long-range delivery systems.Another study, the Quadrennial Defense Review 2001 Working Group by the National Defense University laments, and I quote, ``Given the diffusion of advanced military technologies and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, one could envision an adversary armed with longer-range missiles and cruise missiles, weapons of mass destruction, advanced integrated air defense systems, and/or sophisticated anti-ship mines and missiles by 2010, if not sooner.''U.S. military forces, then--forward deployed to temper adversarial behavior and required to provide both a credible deterrence and an overwhelming response to aggression if needed--face new and multiple challenges, not the least of which is to consider anew its role in assisting with defense of national territory.Set within this context, U.S. strategists are challenged with questions about nuclear strategy and force posture, arms control regimes, and missile defense modernization options. Missile proliferation has introduced an immediate threat to American uniformed personnel stationed abroad, and brought to the fore the prospect of ballistic missile attack on the United States as a real possibility within the next 5 to 7 years.China, Russia, and North Korea each have well-armed missiles capable of striking parts or all of the United States, and other nations, such as Iran, may possess similar technology in the not too distant future.This new setting has led some to call for a new strategic synthesis and a doctrinal requirement to, in the words of Michael Krepon, and I quote, ``reduce the dangers from missiles and weapons of mass destruction in the uncertain period ahead.''Still, the view of the threat from abroad should not create a threat from within. An effort must be made to avoid strategic decisions that might antagonize our international competitors and/or partners, leading them to adopt a posture even more belligerent in nature. Krepon suggests, and I quote, ``The net effect of missile deployments should be to reinforce reductions in nuclear forces, reassure allies, support nonproliferation partners, and reduce the salience of missiles and weapons of mass destruction.''Thus, the threat to America should be viewed holistically. It should be viewed with an eye receptive to the benefits of negotiation, diplomacy, and arms reduction possibilities, mindful of adversarial intent. The possibility of a threat does not necessarily deem it likely. Whereas missile threats to the United States and allies indeed exist and are likely to increase, other threats also remain. America, therefore, should invest in a force structure commensurate with likely threats. Above all, consideration of missile defense systems must not acquire a 21st century Maginot Line mentality.Calls for nonpartisanship respecting an issue are generally rhetorical and strategic in nature as regards their political origin. Missile doctrine made manifest in congressional policy, however, cries out for just that approach. No other defense posture is as pregnant with controversy and potential for bitter political conflict. The costs of commitment alone set off warning bells throughout the budget spectrum. Discussion can rapidly descend into confrontation and accusation if we do not pledge to bring serious, sober consideration and resolution to the table. What is needed presently is the equivalent of a congressional deep breath.We need to remember the various missile launch scenarios are abstract evaluations and the solutions promulgated in response are visions, for the most part, still on paper and in the mind's eye.Missiles, offensive or defensive, are at best a technological answer to a military question, not a diplomatic answer to a question of negotiation. International diplomacy and national policy remain an art, not a science. Science is fixed and immutable in its consequence, while art, as Andy Warhol said, is what one can get away with.Congress must guard against allowing missile defense systems becoming the policy, allowing the technology, in effect, to develop its own psychology. There is gradually being created in the United States a burgeoning military and corporate apparatus dependent in large measure on missile defense to rationalize its existence.It is imperative, therefore, that the Congress assess the role of missile defense policy in the overall context of national security and economic stability. The issues are real. The responsibility is ours.",

    "title": "ASIAN ELEPHANT CONSERVATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2001",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, before I begin my formal remarks, I would like to pay tribute to my good friend, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton). I think he is being a bit modest by simply citing the fact that he introduced this Asian elephant conservation bill and gave me the privilege of being able to sign it with him as the ranking member on his committee at that time.I am very grateful to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Gilchrest) and his staff, both for the majority and the minority, not only for the reauthorization on the present H.R. 700, but for the incredible, great work that the staff did with the introduction of the original bill.My respect for the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton), I can say without reservation, was considerable before this took place, and has only risen since that time. If there is anyone in this body that carries through on the implications of any legislation with which he or she is associated, it is the gentleman from New Jersey.In this particular instance, as he cited in his remarks, the Asian elephant simply did not have the kind of profile, either in world opinion or in the consciousness of those interested in the environment and conservation throughout the world, that the African elephant did.The reauthorization in the previous bill is, of course, needed, and the work that has been done with regard to the African elephant and the role played by the United States of America in that has been considerable and most positive, as has been cited. But in this particular instance, because of the insight and the carry-through of the gentleman from New Jersey, the Asian elephant was able to achieve at least some place in the sun that it would not otherwise have occupied.The implications for southeast Asia in particular are considerable because, as I will state in my more formal remarks, the Asian elephant is in fact a flagship species with respect to all kinds of considerations in the environment and conservation of other species, and I firmly believe that in time to come, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton) will be recognized not only as a pioneer with regard to Asian elephant conservation, but as one of the primary figures in the world environmental and conservation movement.I wish to add one other thing, Mr. Speaker. I also want to pay tribute to, and I wish he was on the floor so I actually could look him in the eye when I was saying it, because of the pleasure it would give me, I want to mention in particular the gentleman from California (Mr. Pombo), who has been instrumental in educating me for one, I can tell the Members, on the questions of conservation of wild animals and the environment.I think he has played a particularly positive role in support of the kinds of things that the gentleman from New Jersey has taken the lead on, and especially in the realm of wild animal conservation, the gentleman from California (Mr. Pombo) is a leader. It is a pleasure to be associated with him in this regard, as well.That said, Mr. Speaker, with recent awareness of the increasing threat to the welfare of the Asian elephant, an already endangered species, a bill entitled the Asian Elephant Conservation Act of 1997 was introduced into the House of Representatives in June of 1997. It passed the House in October, on October 21, and the Senate on November 8, and was signed into law by the President on November 19, 1997.The act is designed to assist the conservation of Asian elephants by supporting and providing financial resources for the conservation programs of nations within the range of the Asian elephant, and projects of persons with demonstrated expertise in the conservation of Asian elephants. A grants program was established for awarding proposals that fulfilled the purpose described by the act.This act has been very successful, Mr. Speaker, and is not a foreign giveaway program. The funds appropriated under this act are matched by the recipient countries. It gives them the necessary support so they can leverage this money with their own resources to establish conservation and research programs, communication networks and administration, to save these endangered animals.Unless immediate steps are taken to conserve this magnificent animal, it will surely continue to disappear from much, if not most, of its traditional habitat. This program helps establish a win-win situation where recipient countries can explore management strategies that minimize poaching and negative elephant and human interaction in farming communities. In short, recipient countries are able to find solutions that are in their economic best interests.Also assisting these countries on a wide range of projects are numerous non-governmental organizations and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our good friends, the chairman and the ranking member, for giving us the opportunity to appear here. I want to say that while, for many, bills which come on the consent calendar may seem to be pro forma in presentation, over and over and over again when we examine the content and context of the bills before us, we find that they are addressing issues of prime importance, not only to people of the United States, but in many instances we can say to people of the world. This bill is in fact one of them. I am very, very pleased and proud to have been associated with it, and count it as among the genuine privileges of holding public office, particularly in the House of representatives, to be associated with the individuals who have made this day possible.Mr. Speaker, the Asian Elephant Conservation Act of 1997 was authored by U.S. Representative Jim Saxton (R-NJ) and myself.With recent awareness of the increasing threat to the welfare of the Asian elephant, already an endangered species, a bill entitled Asian Elephant Conservation Act of 1997 was introduced into the House of Representatives June 4, 1997. Passed by the House on October 21 and by the Senate on November 8, it was signed into law by the President on November 19, 1997. The act is designed to assist in the conservation of Asian elephants by supporting and providing financial resources for the conservation programs of nations within the range of Asian elephants and projects of persons with demonstrated expertise in the conservation of Asian elephants. A grants program was established for awarding proposals that fulfill the purpose described by the Act.This act has been very successful and is not a foreign ``give-away'' program. The funds appropriated under this Act are matched by the recipient countries. It gives them the necessary support so that they can leverage this money with their own resources to establish conservation and research programs, communication networks and administration to save these endangered animals.Unless immediate steps are taken to conserve this magnificent animal, it will surely continue to disappear from much, if not most, of its traditional habitat.This program helps establish a win-win situation where recipient countries can explore management strategies that minimize poaching and negative elephant and human interaction in farming communities.In short, recipient countries are able to find solutions that are in their economic best interests. Also assisting these countries on a wide range of projects are numerous non-governmental organizations and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.The United States must continue their leadership in this very important conservation program. I cannot overemphasize that this is where a relatively small appropriation has helped leverage a very successful program that has stopped the decline of the Asian elephant saving it from possible extinction.We cannot allow the Asian elephant, which has such a direct impact on so many other species, to become extinct. The goal of this legislation is to stop the decline and hopefully rebuild the population of this irreplaceable species by financing with a small amount of federal money a number of conservation projects.According to international experts, there are fewer than 45,000 Asian elephants living in the wild. On a daily basis, these animals face the loss of their forest habitat, poachers who kill them for their bones, hide, ivory and meat, capture for use in Burma's timber industry, and conflicts between elephants and man.Unless immediate steps are taken to help conserve this species, it will continue to disappear from its historic habitat. We should not allow this magnificent animal to disappear from this planet. This investment by the United States will significantly improve the likelihood that wild Asian elephants will exist into the 21st century.The act was modeled after the highly successful African Elephant Conservation Act of 1988 and the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act of 1994.It established an Asian Elephant Conservation Fund to be administered by the U.S. Department of Interior. The measure would be authorized for 5 years and $5 million per year.The funding could be used for: Anti-poaching efforts, conservation management plans, translocation of threatened populations, monitoring of census figures and known populations, and public education for elephant conservation.This legislation is endorsed by organizations like the World Wildlife Fund, Safari Club International and other conservation groups.Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the following information on the Asian elephant:There are an estimated 35,000 to 45,000 Asian Elephants living in the wild in 13 Asian nations. The Asian Elephant is listed as ``endangered'' under the United States' Endangered Species Act. The major causes for elephants' ``endangered'' status are: Loss of habitat caused by population growth (all Asian Elephants required a shady or forest environment and the forest habitat in Asia is rapidly disappearing); fragmented populations of elephants (there are only 14 populations that have more than 1,000 elephants each); and poaching for meat, hide bones, ivory and teeth (bones and teeth are used in traditional Chinese medicine). The largest population of Asian Elephants in the wild are found in: India (20,000 to 24,000), Burma (5,000 to 6,0900), and Indonesia (2,500 to 4,500). Wild elephants are still captured and trained for use in logging operations in Burma. The Asian Elephant is a flagship species and its conservation has a positive impact on other animals like tigers, rhinoceros, clouded leopards, Malayan Sunbears, Hoolock gibbons, lion-tailed macaques and peacock pheasants. The Asian elephant can weigh up to 5400 kg (11,900 lb). It currently occupies forested habitats in hilly or mountainous terrain, up to about 3600 m (11,800'). An adult eats approximately 150 kg (330 lb) per day--mainly grasses but also leaves, twigs and bark. It feeds during the morning, evening and night and rests during the middle of the day, requiring shade during the hot season to keep from overheating. Elephants cannot go for long without water (they require 70-90 liters (19-24 gal) of fluid/day) and sometimes must travel long distances each day between their water supplies and feeding areas. One calf is born every 3-4 years after a pregnancy lasting about 22 months. Although mature male elephants may live alone, females live in family groups consisting of mothers, daughters and sisters, together with immature males. Wild elephants can live to be sixty years old. The Asian elephant once ranged from the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in ancient Mesopotamia in the west, east through Asia south of the Himalaya to Indochina and the Malay Peninsula, including Sri Lanka and Sumatra and possibly Java, and north into China at least as far as the Yangtze River. In the 19th century it was still common over much of the Indian subcontinent, Sri Lanka and the eastern parts of its range. By 1978, Asian elephant were found in the same countries as they are at present. Female Asian elephants are not affected by ivory poaching (due to their lack of tusks), so poaching has not affected the overall population numbers of Asian elephants as drastically as it has in the case of the African elephant. The single most important cause of the decline of the Asian elephant has been the loss of habitat. They have also been affected by persecution due to the crop damage they are perceived to cause. Counties where it is currently found: 1996: Occurs in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. Maximum age: Sixty years in the wild (more than 80 years in captivity). Social organization: The Asian elephant is gregarious, and, although males sometimes live alone, females are always found in family groups consisting of mothers, daughters, sisters and immature males. In the 19th century, these family groups usually consisted of 30-50 animals, but much larger groups, as large as 100 individuals, were not uncommon. Sometimes an adult male can be associated with a herd. When not, adult males usually remain solitary and disperse over relatively small, widely overlapping home ranges; sometimes they gather together in small but temporary bull herds. They do not seem to be territorial, and there is a great amount of toleration between them, except possibly when the cows are in estrus. Asian elephants are very sociable and live in basic family units of one adult cow and her offspring. Daughters remain with their mothers, but sons leave at puberty, often joining bull groups or remaining solitary. Bull elephants associate with a family when a cow is in oestrus. This species does not appear to be territorial. Males have home ranges of about 15 square km, and herds of females of about 30 square km, which increases in the dry season. Seasonal migration has been made virtually impossible, due to human development. Females usually have one calf after a gestation period of 18-22 months and give birth every three to four years. The calves weigh about 100 kg at birth and suckle for about 18 months. They can eat some vegetation after several months. Asian elephants are now listed as endangered, and have long since vanished from Southwest Asia and most of China. Sri Lanka was once recognized for its large elephant populations, but today the numbers are being reduced. As the number of humans increases, the area of natural habitat that the elephants rely on is being depleted. Elephants are being forced onto farming areas, where they cause damage.",

I am pleading with my colleagues, I am making a plea to my colleagues, one Member to another. Every one of my colleagues know me here, some longer than others. Every one of us are colleagues here. Every one of us understands that if another Member asks something of someone, that something is fundamental to the very well-being of their constituents. Please give the benefit of the doubt.That is what this is about tonight. I realize, as both the chairman and as the ranking member have made clear, I am sure there are a myriad of difficulties associated with this proposition, but there is good and sufficient time subsequent to tonight to deal with all of those. I am sure the chairman would agree and that the ranking member would agree.I am here to tell Members that the State of Hawaii is at risk of bankruptcy if there is not confidence in the people of this country being able to fly. I am not trying to deal with hyperbole, I am not trying to deal in rhetorical flights, I am saying the basic, fundamental, fiscal facts of life for my State.I am pleading with the gentleman. Surely none of us are sufficiently filled with wisdom to understand the ramifications of every nuance of this legislation, but we have to have enough confidence and trust in one another to give ourselves the opportunity to come to grips with these various problems, including, Mr. Speaker, the most fundamental one.What terrorists seek to do is not necessarily to kill people. If that happens, from their point of view, well and good. But they seek to instill fear and discord and anxiety and loss of confidence. That is what this is all about. We cannot succumb to that or they win.There is not a person in here, Mr. Speaker, since Tuesday, that has cast a vote with which they were completely at ease. I do not believe that a single Member here has been completely at ease, or maybe even mostly at ease with every vote. But I plead with any Member who is thinking of objecting tonight, please do not do it. Please give us the opportunity to act as colleagues. Please do not put at risk millions of jobs, not tens of thousands, millions of jobs. Do not forget that most of the foodstuffs in this country travel by air. The exports from State to State, it is not just road, it is in the air.So we must not take a chance that the legislation that has been crafted and the money associated with it will be dealt with anything other than in circumstances in which the greatest possible care will be taken when it comes to the floor after conference.",

    "title": "NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002",
    "text": "Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, and urge my colleagues to support this important measure.This year, we lost two great friends on the House Armed Services Committee, our former Chairman, Floyd Spence from South Carolina, and Norm Sisisky from Virginia. Both of these men dedicated the majority of their time here in Congress to ensuring the defense of our Nation, and they are deeply missed on the Committee and in this Congress. Their tremendous contributions to our national defense serve an as example to this Congress as we look to strengthen our military and continue to improve living and working conditions for our men and women in uniform.I would like to recognize Chairman Stump and Ranking Member Skelton for their astute leadership of this Committee and for the bipartisan manner in which they have crafted a bill to address the immediate needs of our Armed Forces. In the venerable tradition of the Armed Services Committee, these gentlemen have worked side by side, across party lines, to provide our military with the means to defend our Nation.I would also like to commend my good friend and colleague, Jim Saxton, Chairman of the Military Installations and Facilities Subcommittee, whom I have been so fortunate to work closely with, both on Armed Services and the Resources Committees. His sincere concern for the quality of life of our troops, as well as his truly bipartisan, cooperative leadership, have guaranteed an equitable bill that directly answers the pressing needs of our military infrastructure.Finally, I would like to thank the Committee staff for their tireless work and invaluable expertise. I would especially like to thank the Military Installations and Facilities Subcommittee professional staff, George Withers and Phil Grone, who is leaving the Committee to serve as an Administration official at the Pentagon.As Ranking Member of the Military Installations and Facilities Subcommittee, I am particularly proud of the remarkable boost this bill will give to our military housing and infrastructure. The Military Construction provisions build upon a healthy budget proposed by the President, and I am gratified to see that when it comes to taking care of our service members and their families, we are all unified in opinion. Our people, and their living and working conditions, must continue to be our number one priority.The unspeakable events of September 11, 2001, should not alter our commitment to quality of life initiatives. Five carrier battlegroups are currently underway, preparing for potential offensive operations. The President has authorized mobilization of up to 50,000 Ready Reservists. Now more than ever, it is imperative that we show our appreciation for those who volunteer to go in harm's way. Even in light of extreme uncertainty about the future, these young men and women pledge to support and defend American democracy, both at home and abroad. We owe it to them, and to their families, to keep our promise of increased safety and morale in the home and in the workplace.This bill does just that. It authorizes $10.3 billion for construction and renovation of critical infrastructure and family housing, approximately $350 million more than the Administration's request. Our bill includes $1.2 billion to build 51 new barracks and dormitories for single and unaccompanied service personnel. Often, our junior, single soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines get overlooked in the rush to raise the standards on quality of life. This Committee has taken substantive steps to remedy this inequity, through improved living accommodations and a significant pay raise. The bill authorizes $1.1 billion for new construction and modernization of 6,800 family housing units--a down payment on our commitment to eradicate deteriorating, World War II-era living conditions. It also makes permanent the authorities in the Military Housing Privatization Initiative that use private sector expertise and capital to accelerate improvement of government-owned housing and help eliminate a serious shortage of quality affordable housing. Of special note, the Committee has responded to the concerns of our modern military families by recommending $36.2 million for six child development centers--a critical need for couples who both work as well as single parents.Our achievements in Military Construction will be an ongoing effort aimed at providing quality living and working facilities for our entire military family, stationed at home and overseas. I know that under Mr. Saxton's excellent stewardship, the Subcommittee on Military Installations and Facilities will continue to focus on raising the living and working standards for our Armed Forces. They have volunteered to protect our freedom. Now we must protect them by building safe, modern facilities for the 21st century military.Again, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.",

    "title": "FARM SECURITY ACT OF 2001",
    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I am strongly opposed to the amendment altering the provisions of the Agriculture Committee's bill.Make no mistake about it. The purpose of this amendment to kill the sugar program, similar to the unsuccessful attempts in the past.The amendment will keep the current program, which has devastated domestic sugar. Today, there are only two commercial sugar plantations left in Hawaii, the result of the 1996 Act which has crippled the industry and left thousands of Americans unemployed, many of them in Hawaii. What this nation needs now is more American jobs, not fewer.In addition it would cut the existing supports by $.03 a pound. A rough calculation indicates such a move would transfer $500.0 million from the domestic sugar producers to the food processors.While sugar prices have plummeted, food prices have risen. The wholesale price of sugar has dropped 29 percent since the 1996 law while sweetened product prices have risen 4 percent-14 percent. It is not difficult to determine that consumers will not see one dime of that $500.0 million. It will go straight into the pockets of the food manufacturers and processors who have soaked up all the additional revenue resulting from staggeringly low sugar prices since the 1996 Act.Not only will the food processors unfairly benefit, but more foreign-produced sugar will pour into the country. My colleagues, in numerous cases, that imported sugar will certainly be produced by child labor and with no environmental protections.How on earth are we helping either our own country or the rest of the world by adopting this amendment?We've heard reports of candy manufacturers moving to Mexico. That is their prerogative, as much as I disagree with their abandoning America. The distortion that has been perpetuated, however, is that it is because of domestic sugar prices. Nothing could be further from the truth. Domestic sugar prices in Mexico have been consistently higher in Mexico than in the U.S. The reason they and other manufacturers have moved to Mexico is that labor costs are far lower and environmental protections are unenforced and ignored.The Mexican government, and other foreign producers, then dump production in excess of their domestic consumption, regardless of their domestic price, on the world market for whatever price they can get. That is called the ``world price'' of sugar. In reality, it is the dump price, and that is the price at which the supporters of the amendment want to purchase sugar.My colleagues, this amendment is strictly about money. It is about whether money will be paid to American workers for an American product produced with environmental protections and labor standards or whether it goes directly to the food processors and manufacturers to increase their profits regardless of the consequences domestically or internationally.The House Agriculture Committee has developed a fair, rational and effective way to keep this industry producing an American product by American workers. I urge you in the strongest possible terms to reject this cynical, ill-conceived attack on American sugar producers and on hard-working people.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the plight of seven polar bears languishing in a traveling animal show called the Suarez Brothers Circus. The circus is based in Mexico and travels around Central and South America, throughout the year, with its menagerie.In May 2001, the USFWS, in consultation with USDA, decided to issue a permit to allow the circus into Puerto Rico. This permit was issued over the objection of the Marine Mammal Commission. The Commission warned that the provenance of the bears was questionable and that there were serious deficiencies in the required paperwork for the bears. In June, Dr. Terry Maple, Director of Zoo Atlanta, contacted USDA and asserted that at least one of the bears had been imported under a false identity. The use of doctored or fabricated records is grounds for denying the circus a permit to exhibit.In August, during the hottest days of summer, the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources filed animal cruelty charges against the circus for keeping the bears in 113 degree heat without access to water or air conditioning. Additional charges have been added for maintaining the bears in ``dirty or parasitic conditions''. Their trial date is scheduled for January 22, 2002.In October, the Marine Mammal Commission again wrote to USFWS and APHIS and outlined the numerous violations of federal law and expressed a fundamental concern about the appropriateness of using polar bears outdoors in a tropical climate. In their letter, the Commission noted violations of the Animal Welfare Act reported by APHIS on eight separate inspections. These violations included serious charges including inaccessibility to water and fans, a lack of structural integrity in the holding pens, and a lack of veterinary care.Just two weeks ago, APHIS testified before the Resources Committee that it has inspected the circus at least eleven times since June--as compared to the average number of inspections being one per year. The USDA has documented a clear pattern of non-compliance with the bare minimum standards of the Animal Welfare Act.Mr. Speaker, these polar bears are clearly suffering and need relief. These animals should be confiscated and placed in facilities that are capable of caring for their unique needs. Members of the House and Senate, including the Delegate from Puerto Rico, are circulating letters to colleagues and to the federal agencies requesting urgent action in this case, including an investigation and confiscation of the polar bears.Puerto Rico is no place for polar bears.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I have about 2 minutes to reach out to not just the people on this floor, but everybody who is listening in their offices. I feel like I almost have to conjure John the Baptist to get this across.Why are we debating a bill on the Andes when people are hurting all across this country right now today? If anything can be seen as showing the irrelevance of this Congress while people are losing their jobs all across this country, we cannot get a bill on this floor for a retail sales tax holiday. We cannot get the Travel America Now Act on this floor. But we can come in and get a bill so that drug dealers in the Andes can invest in gardening or anything else that they want to get into in order to come into this country and sell those products as well.Do you think for a second that the drug dealers are going out of business with this bill?We have got to come on this floor today and vote this down and demand that the Committee on Ways and Means come in here with bills that are going to address the economic problems that have happened since September 11.All this calm discussion on this floor completely bypasses what has happened to the people in this country. All the small businesses in this country that come down here and we say we honor every day in this Congress, we are ignoring them right now. I am as hot as I can be about this because we are being ignored. I feel my heart pounding every day because I see people out of work. They cannot pay their bills in the next 60 days. They cannot make their mortgage payments. They cannot tell their kids why they cannot have clothes on their backs when they go to school, and we are talking about the Andes. We are talking about we need to move. This bill is time sensitive. What is time sensitive is whether we are responding to the needs of the people in this country, right now, post-September 11.People from New York have to come down here and beg, beg this Congress to see whether we are going to respond to them. I do not want to hear any lectures about how the economy will recover in 3 years. I do not want to hear lectures on philosophic permutations that might take place in the overall economy.I want action now on behalf of the people of this country.

    "title": "OUR NATION AND THE SEA",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, on October 11, 2001, Mr. John P. Craven, the President and founder of the Common Heritage Corporation, Honolulu, Hawaii, was honored as a Doherty Lecturer in our Nation's Capital. I would like to share some of his thoughts and comments about our Nation and the sea with my colleagues by having his enclosed keynote speech entered into the Congressional Record.The days of my years are more than three score and ten and I find myself called upon to share the experiences of a lifetime of involvement with a diverse set of vocations and avocations--all involving the ocean. To be chosen as the Doherty lecturer is a particularly special invitation, inasmuch as it is an honor to which I have aspired for longer than I can remember. When to my surprise I received word of my selection, I lost no time in weighing anchor and setting sail. The formal invitation arrived several days later and I discovered that I was sailing under false colors. I was not invited, as I assumed, as the flamboyant master of submarine espionage depicted in the best selling book Blind Man's Bluff. Instead it was clear that my invitation was based on my role as the Past Director of the Law of the Sea Institute, an international NGO dedicated to the creation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. I was thus expected to say, as I will say, that it is imperative that the United States ratify this convention. It was also apparent that I was invited as the President of the Common Heritage Corporation, a company intimately involved in the use of ocean resources and dedicated to the management of innovation involved in the use of ocean resources and dedicated to the management of innovation for the benefit of humanity. I was thus also expected to say, as I will say, that society must commit itself to research and development of programs leading to the use of ocean resources and ocean space to change our world into an environmentally sustainable habitat for its burgeoned and burgeoning population. I am here today, therefore, as the wearer of three distinctly different caps: one representing my years of involvement in national security, another designating me as a proponent of translational law and justice and a third worn by an innovator of futuristic technology. Yet it is my contention that my roles are connected by more than just the ocean. They also form an integrated view of the future--a view that I believe society must come to accept for its survival. Through the anecdotes that follow, I hope to provide my fellow Americans with insights into the lessons that I have learned during my careers, with the hope of convincing you about the importance--indeed the need--of sharing my hopes and aspirations for humanity. Those of you familiar with my own recent book, The Silent War, may recall my description of ``The Polaris Marching and Chowder Society.'' This Honolulu-based group initially consisted of submariners that had a role in the development of the Polaris Fleet Ballistic Missile system (the nation's first undersea strategic deterrent). The Society has met for breakfast once each month for the past two decades. I quote from my book here: ``What prevents this breakfast from being just another gathering of old timers is the regular attendance of the active duty commander of the submarine forces of the Pacific fleet and members of his staff. This is a family breakfast and a rare opportunity for the family elders to offer their wisdom to the young in command. I am an adopted member of this family and, except for myself, all are qualified to wear the dolphins of the submarine service.'' A surprising number are also qualified to wear the master divers pin, suggesting that they are a part of the teams of ``saturated divers'' (i.e., humans as marine mammals living on the open ocean seabed of the world's continental shelves). They have carried out highly classified ``special operations'' of intelligence gathering for more than thirty years. At the Society's meeting this past October 3rd, the events of September 11th were fresh in all members' minds. I distributed copies of The Silent War to young officers who were first time breakfast attendees. I noted that my book was written with the tacit encouragement of the Navy and the Intelligence services to tell the story of these operations as they should be told, without compromising national security. The very existence of these special operations was a secret until the publication of Blind Man's Bluff. Sensitive details will not be revealed or discussed at this or any other meeting of the Marching and Chowder Society, but my book details the philosophy and strategy employed in winning the Cold War without firing a shot. The relevance of that philosophy and that strategy to the war against terrorism was a major topic at the Society's last meeting. I reminded the Society of an unclassified talk given by former CIA Director Robert Gates at a reunion of the submarine Parche--the winner of seven Presidential Unit citations. He asserted that the CIA had four classes of heroes: (1) Operatives in the field who intercepted vital communications; (2) scientists and technicians who designed equipments and units that could intercept communications; (3) the operators of these equipments in environments where their skills were required and where their lives were in danger; and (4) the analysts in the intelligence agencies who interpreted the results of these missions and transmitted them to the President for those national policy positions and actions which would deter war and win peace. Director Gates then informed the men of Parche that the missions of the United States Navy submarine service were the most important of all the missions that had been conducted and that their story ``had to be told.'' This morning meeting ended with the thought that now more than ever the story had to be told for its relevance to the new conflict. Indeed, that very morning Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld reminded the public of the long drawn out but successful Cold War experience that we might have to endure to resolve the current terrorism conflict. What emerged from that meeting were insights into what I might characterize as my first lesson of this afternoon: We cannot ask the Federal Government to reveal how many cruise missiles, cable tapping, undersea surveillance units have been built and deployed. Indeed, it is possible that nobody knows. The compartmentalization of this program within the Navy and within other Federal agencies is such that it is doubtful that any single individual has the knowledge of the ``need to know'' the full panoply of our undersea capability. What then should Americans know? At the very least, we should know and understand that the people of the United States have occupied ``inner space,'' or the oceans of our planet, in a manner that we have not accomplished or cannot hope to accomplish in outer space for a decade or more. Americans should know that we can publish and proclaim this underwater capability in a way that will not compromise national security but will tell those that would do us harm that we are in full control of the undersea environment. We should so publish; we should so proclaim. I had to leave the Chowder Society breakfast early to hasten to Washington to attend the forum on the international law of terrorism organized by our host, John Norton Moore. En route To Dulles, I was recognized by a visibly nervous flight attendant who had seen me on The History Channel. The cause of her concern was understandable to all of us I'm sure, but some reflection and perspective are in order here. This woman and a hundred or so others were hurtling through the sky at 40,000 feet and more than five hundred miles per hour--a remarkable transportation achievement. Science and technology had made air travel so safe that the statistical likelihood or her demise remained an extraordinarily low probability event--recent tragic events notwithstanding. To remind and reassure her, I gave her a copy of The Silent War inscribed with my most immediate poetic thoughts of the moment: ``And the night shall be filled with music and the cares that infest the day shall fold their tents like the nomads and as silently steal away.'' Later that evening as with headphones on my head and brandy in my hand I looked out the window to see the beautiful glow of the lights of Denver below before sweet sleep possessed me. My last thoughts were: ``Shall I be lifted to the skies on flowery beds of ease while others seek to win the prize and sail through stormy seas.'' The lesson of this anecdote was first taught to us by Franklin Delano Roosevelt as we faced the prospect of World War II: ``The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.'' Upon my arrival in Washington, I listened to a set of provocative legal papers presented by brilliant scholars including the Honorable Stephen Schwebel, former President International Court of Justice, Professor Ruth Wedgwood of the Yale Law School and Professor Malvina Halberstam of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. A central issue discussed was whether in the present instance, state sponsored assassination in defense of a terrorist would be murder or legally justified as an act of self-defense.remarked to a most distinguished legal colleague seated next to me that I thought it was a matter of perspective as to whether you were holding the trigger or peering into the barrel of a gun. My colleague shot me down with the rejoinder that my remark was political and not legal. I believe Gandhi had the better view. Certainly to the surprise of many not closely familiar with his philosophy, he has written: ``I do believe that, where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advice violence.'' To be sure, Gandhi characterized violence as an animal response to an immediate attack and non-violence, where possible, as a civilized alternative. Violence under attack becomes acceptable, however, when there is no alternative--that is when a decision to take no action emerges from fear rather than strength. This lesson is one that is particularly timely to Americans today. In any event, all participants including Schwebel agreed that the definitive word of law was enunciated by the United Nations Security Council Resolutions of September 12 and September 28. Indeed until the Security Council spoke unanimously, the United States was not assured of the protection of all of the member States in its actions against terrorist acts. Americans should finally realize that, regardless of individual political feelings about this international body, we have no choice but to seek its protection when a declaration of International Law is necessary in the face of a World crisis. The Law of the Sea Treaty is no different. This is one of the most comprehensive treaties ever negotiated and it has been modified to comply with all of the demands of the United States. Our manifest inability to enforce its provisions through our customary system of law, with the Coast Guard and internal legislation such as the Magnussen Act, demonstrates that our enforcement mechanism requires international cooperation. This cooperation can be assured only if we ratify and, parenthetically, pay our United Nations dues to support the Convention. In contemplating the critical issues concerning national security and transnational law that I have set forth this afternoon, it is essential to consider the fundamental problem from which they emerge. These issues are rooted in the underlying reality that the resources of the world are limited while the potential consumers of these resources continue to grow in numbers. Thus, I now finish my Doherty Lecture wearing the hat of the President of the Common Heritage Corporation, or CHC. I established CHC a decade ago in order to address the problems of an increasing global population, now over 6 billion, and its associated migration to the coastal zone. CHC's product is the demonstrated design of an environmentally sustainable habitat for installation on coastal deserts having access to deep ocean water. Our facility on the Kona coast of Hawaii is a showroom for the demonstration of such an installation. This showroom was specifically designed for Haiti, although our first installation may well occur in the Marshall Islands or in a form suitable for the affluent developed world on the island of Oahu. Any of you who have visited Haiti know that it is a coastal desert on the lee side of a trade wind island. It has a population of six million living in desperate and deprived conditions. The local fishing industry does not have a single motorized fishing boat or any cooling or refrigeration. Fish are caught off the northern coast and by the time they arrive in the market at Port au Prince, about a third of the catch are not edible, even by Haitian standards. Haiti's fishermen care not that the maximum sustainable yield of the ocean was exceeded some twenty-five years ago. They must fish or perish. Agriculture and manufacturing are non-existent and the government is effectively dysfunctional. Common Heritage Corporation has a joint venture agreement with a Haitian Company, ``Energie General,'' that would be capable of managing the installation of one of our facilities, if the political climate of Haiti were receptive to such an installation. Today it cannot. We nevertheless are proceeding, waiting for that day to come. What technology is in use at CHC's facility? It utilizes the sun and deep ocean water as its primary resource. Deep Ocean water or DOW is very cold, very rich in nutrients and very biologically pure. We convert seawater into fresh water in a device called a microclimate tower, which operates like nature--using the cheap cold at the top of the tower to condense vapor from hot ocean water at the bottom. We do air conditioning and industrial cooling utilizing deep ocean water that passes through reclaimed automobile radiators. We grow cold-water algae utilizing the deep ocean water nutrients, and then use the algae as compost and as food for humans, for abalone, for shrimps, lobsters and fish. We have also developed a form of agriculture that utilizes deep ocean water passing through PVC pipes in the ground, producing more than enough condensate for irrigation and a thermodynamic environment that can only be characterized as a super spring. But our facility is also designed as habitat. Accordingly, it does more than produce the basic necessities of life. Young children who visit our facility are quick to understand a habitat is more than life--it must also foster liberty and the pursuit of happiness. To that end, our facility features every kind of crop and food product, every kind of flower, parks and gardens and athletic fields for soccer and even golf. Our facility has been technically successful beyond our wildest dreams. By way of illustration, let me tell you what we are doing with grapes. We have grape vines that grow in the hot desert without any rain or external irrigation. Cold ocean water pipes embedded three feet deep at the root zone provide the irrigation water and the thermodynamic climate. When the grapes are ripe and harvested, the cold water is turned off. The vines are then pruned and, after a week of dormancy, the cold water is turned on again and the vines produce yet another crop. Three abundant crops per year are produced, one of which is illustrated by the photograph that has been distributed. But returning to Haiti briefly, we confront the basic problem that it cannot avail itself of our technology for the simple reason that it requires a significant number of dollars to install a system. Export crops are, of course, one way to raise dollars, but these crops must first be produced. In order to simulate the economic obstacles to the installation of a CHC sustainable facility in a country like Haiti, CHC operates as ``bare-bones'' a corporation as you are likely to see in the developed world. CHC has not borrowed any money from a bank. It utilizes where legal and possible its management and student trainees for construction and labor, much as is done by organizations such as Habitat for Humanity. Apart from a small amount of electric power and a very limited amount of external supplies, the entire facility is self-sustaining. Thus, the jar of jelly provided to each of you symbolically and literally represents what CHC's technology can make possible with developing world production techniques, notwithstanding all of the economic limitations. The glass jars and tops were manufactured in the Dominican Republic and purchased in bulk quantities at extremely low cost. The label was designed by a member of CHC's Board of Directors and printed using an obsolete computer printer purchased at a thrift shop. The cartons were assembled and loaded by my family here in Washington--and we could not prevent my two- year-old granddaughter from filling the boxes and applying stickers and decorations on some of the boxes as a form of play. What more can CHC do to demonstrate the viability of environmentally sustainable habitats? We carried our PowerPoint road show to Mexico and gave a high level presentation the government agency responsible for economic development for the poor. Enthralled by our presentation, they asked how much an initial 100-acre installation would cost. Between five and ten million dollars was CHC's reply--a bargain. They were appalled. The agency's entire budget for the year was only 70 million dollars--a simple result of the devaluation of the peso. Committing up to one-seventh of their resources to a single project was simply out of the question. Americans, we and other countries must find a way to avoid these Catch 22s and to start a development process that promotes an environmentally sustainable world. This world must be capable of providing all of its citizens with a reasonable standard of life. And, we must start now. I speak not from an abstract perspective of what a good and just society would do. Instead, I am asserting an imperative. The tragic incidents of the past month have revealed that we can no longer ignore the resource limitations that confront the world. The gap between rich and poor nations grows greater and greater; the population of the developing world grows at unsustainable rates, yet even the best-intentioned citizens of developed nations have done little more than engage in impassioned rhetoric. We have let our global educational and research activities atrophy and decay; we have imposed the product of our material comforts on the impoverished and peoples of the undeveloped world. Should it surprise us that people with literally nothing to lose might choose to lash out against us? We have replaced reality with a dazzling world of virtual reality, but September 11th has taught us that there are realities that we can no longer ignore. I speak from a lifetime of immersion in that real world. Even so, from that experience I conclude that there is hope. Americans we must and we can work with the World to end terrorism--there is no alternative; we must and we can work with the world to defuse the threats of war--there is no alternative; we must and we can work with the world to establish an international regime for the wise use of the ocean--there is no alternative, and; we must and we can start the development process that leads to an environmentally sustainable world habitat for humanity--there is no alternative--there is none.",

I have an article here on what was called a bone-sopping rainy day, hundreds of unemployed people in Waikiki coming hoping they could get a job working on invasive species in Hawaii, to work with their hands in the fields to try to work to make our environment better.We have 31,000 people out of work directly as a result of September 11. What I am asking is cannot the example of the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) and the appropriators here be brought to bear when we deal with the other bills that are coming forward with respect to how we are going to deal with the economic trauma that has hit the whole country?Mr. Chairman, perhaps the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas) at that time misunderstood my quest that day. I voted against the Democrat bill and the Republican bill that is supposed to be dealing with economic stimulus. Let us use what the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh) has done and what the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey), the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey) has done, and what the gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano) has done. Let us use what the gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young) has done by way of leadership on the economic stimulus program and as Republicans and Democrats draw together on behalf of the entire Nation with New York leading the way, and this amendment leading the way, showing us what we can do as Americans to come together and have victory.",

The question is whether it is in the public interest or not.I can tell my colleagues what is going to happen, and we all better remember it. All politics is local. And out where I am anyway, if anyone thinks they are going to show the football game at one time and another infomercial at another time, and that is going to work out somehow in the number of days that you got where you get the lowest rate, you are dreaming.What is going to happen is the local advertisers, aside from me or aside from my colleagues, are going to have to make up the difference. And I am not going back in my district and tell people that are trying to make a living, especially after 9/11, in their advertising that they have to pay more so that people can listen to me.All I am trying to do when I get down there is express all the virtues I have. And at least in my district they already know I am full of virtue.Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Burr-Green amendment.It obviates Section 305 of underlying bill, a provision that does not address the central issues of the campaign finance debate: soft money and so-called ``issue ads''.The language in Section 305 is well intentioned. It seeks to lower the costs of campaigns, a goal everyone agrees is worthwhile.However, the mechanism if flawed. Forcing broadcasters to charge artificially low rates for political ads only invites them to look elsewhere to make up the lost revenue. Section 305 virtually forces them to raise the rates for non-political ads.Using an example from my home state of Hawaii, is it realistic to expect a station to charge the same rate for the UH-BYU football game as for a late-night infomercial? If we force broadcasters to do that, we shouldn't be surprised when business economics compel them to charge more for the ads in slots with smaller audiences. And who ultimately winds up paying for the added charge? Not the advertisers--they're going to turn around and make it up with higher prices for their goods and services.So the ultimate subsidizer of forced ad rate reductions is--you guessed it--the consumer. That's you, me and all the people in our districts. We'll pay more for food, prescription drugs, gasoline--everything from Spam musubi to that neighbor island trip for a family reunion.The bottom line is that Burr-Green is pro-consumer. It has no effect on the thrust of Shays-Meehan. This is an amendment that every Member can support, regardless of which side of this debate you're on.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 368, introduced by my colleague, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Foley), as indicated by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton), and endorsed by numerous other Members of the House. The resolution commends the outstanding progress made thus far by the Pentagon Renovation Program and its contractors in reconstructing the section of the Pentagon damaged by the terrorist attack.On September 11, 2001, Mr. Speaker, our Nation suffered four unprovoked terrorist attacks, three of which found their aim in two of our most powerful symbols of strength and democracy. Two days after the attacks, the Army asked the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton), myself, and several other Members involved in the Subcommittee on Military Construction to visit the Pentagon site and survey the damage sustained there. Like the rest of the American public, we were stunned by the gash in what had previously seemed to be the impenetrable exterior of the Pentagon.What really caught our attention, though, was the work already under way. A small city of support was buzzing on the lawn. Firefighters were still battling flare-ups and hot spots, and military and civilian personnel were securing the building and sifting through the debris. No one was waiting to be told what to do. They were just doing what they knew needed to be done.The Pentagon Renovation Program has exceeded every expectation. The American public realized the significance of healing this visible wound as soon as possible, and the Phoenix Project has made it a reality. Government and contract personnel put their shoulders to the wheel, at times laboring around the clock, to tear down the most severely damaged sections and to rebuild it from the ground up. Demolition was supposed to take 7 or 8 months, Mr. Speaker. The team completed it in 1 month and 1 day. That is the power of American resolve.I have the utmost confidence that the Renovation Program will meet its ultimate goal to have people back at their desks by September 10, 2002. There could be no greater tribute to those who lost their lives than to know that the men and women of the Department of Defense are once again doing the business of the country from their proper Pentagon offices.Mr. Speaker, let us honor these Americans, public workers and private citizens, willing to dedicate themselves to the rebuilding of our national morale.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

Indeed the goddess of fire, ``Pele'' working through the volcanoes created most of the great State of Hawaii. She is still very active and very honored.There are specific areas in my state which are sacred to the Native Hawaiians. Although the areas do not have a large steeple or white-washed fence around them, they nonetheless deserve to be respected and protected.We have begun remediation on the sacred island of Kahoolawe and protected it from further destruction as a military bombing range. But there is so much more to be done.The problem is that we have a few laws that dance around the idea of protecting native sacred lands which use words like ``consultation'' or ``accommodate'' but are inadequate to simply stop potential desecration.Occasionally, we are able to stop the mining of one sacred site, or the demolition of another. But the time has come for Congress to enact strong legislation to protect Native American sacred lands.",

    "title": "BOB STUMP NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003",
    "text": "Mr. Chairman, although I am disappointed in the rule before this body, I rise in strong support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, and urge my colleagues to support this important measure. I deeply regret the decision of the Rules Committee to prohibit several critical amendments from being considered here today.I would first like to recognize our committee leadership, Chairman Stump and Ranking Member Skelton, for the bipartisan bill they have crafted to address the immediate needs of our Armed Forces. Our committee has a long tradition of working across party lines to ensure the readiness and well-being of our Armed Forces, and I am greatly pleased to have participated in yet another cooperative effort with my Armed Services colleagues.We all know that Chairman Stump has announced this intention to retire at the end of this Congress. His steadfast leadership, acknowledged in the title of this bill, will be missed, and I know that the entire House wishes him the best of luck in the future.I would also like to commend my very good friend, Jim Saxton, Chairman of the Military Installations and Facilities Subcommittee, whom I have been so fortunate to work closely with, both on Armed Services and the Resources Committees. His sincere concern for the quality of life of our troops, as well as his truly bipartisan, cooperative leadership, have guaranteed an equitable bill that directly answers the pressing needs for our military infrastructure.I would like to thank the committee staff for their tireless work and invaluable expertise. These professionals have been working day in and day out, weekends included, for the past two months, to put together the best bill possible. I would especially like to thank the Military Installations and Facilities Subcommittee professional staff, George Withers and Tom Hawley. No subcommittee is better served than ours with dedicated, smart, and consummate staff.As ranking member of the Military Installations and Facilities Subcommittee, I am especially concerned about the effect this bill will have on our military housing and infrastructure. Our Subcommittee labored hard to compensate for an anemic construction budget proposed by the President--a budget $1.7 billion lower than that put forward last year. From this highly unsatisfactory starting point, our Subcommittee added $425 million to fund projects vital to the Services. An ongoing campaign against global terrorism is not an excuse to abandon our campaign against substandard facilities and housing. Funding for military construction must match the rhetoric; otherwise, we will lose the battle for quality people willing to serve. Our people, and their living and working conditions, must continue to be our number one priority.Given the military's current operational tempo, it is imperative that we show our appreciation for those who volunteer to go in harm's way. These men and women pledge to support and defend American democracy, both at home and abroad, often at great personal sacrifice and for significant periods of time. We owe it to them, and to their families, to keep our promise of increased safety and morale in the home and in the workplace.In pursuit of such a goal, this bill authorizes $678.4 million--$17.7 million more than the President's request--for construction and improvement of 3,447 family housing units and the privatization of over 30,000 units. Privatization authorities, extended in last year's defense bill, provide our military accelerated opportunities to renovate and build vastly improved family housing developments with private sector capital and I applaud the continuation of this important program. Our committee also included $1.2 billion for construction of 49 new barracks and dormitories in the FY03 authorization and $8.6 million in H.R. 4547, the Cost of War Against Terrorism Authorization Act, for unaccompanied personnel housing in Qatar. Once again, attention to the living conditions of our single soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines has been a high priority for our committee, and I sincerely hope that we can bring all of our barracks up to the same excellent standard set by the Army's Whole Barracks Renewal at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. I am especially pleased to note the $17.6 million provided to build Child Development Centers. This represents funding for four such centers, $6.9 million and one more than recommended by the President's budget, and acknowledges the emphasis this Congress and the military places on the needs of service members with children. Military couples and single parents alike benefit when the military recognizes their specific needs and eases their child-care burdens.Our achievements in military construction will be an ongoing effort aimed at providing quality living and working facilities for our entire military family, stationed at home and overseas. I know that under Mr. Saxton's excellent stewardship, the Subcommittee on Military Installations and Facilities will continue to focus on raising the living and working standards for our Armed Forces. They have volunteered to protect our freedom. Now we must protect them by building safe, modern facilities for the 21st century military.Again, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the month of May 2002 as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.In June 1977, Representatives Frank Horton of New York and Norman Y. Mineta of California introduced a House resolution that called upon the President to proclaim the first 10 days of May as Asian Pacific Heritage Week. That was later followed by a Senate bill introduced the following month by Senators Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga. On October 5, 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed a Joint Resolution designating the annual celebration. In May 1990, the holiday was expanded further when President George Bush designated May to be Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. The month of May was chosen to commemorate the arrival of the first Japanese immigrants to the United States in May 1843.H. Res. 408, introduced by my colleague and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Chair, Representative David Wu, recognizes the contributions of Asian Pacific Americans to our Nation. As an original cosponsor of this resolution, I recognize and commend how Asian Pacific Americans have contributed to the prosperity and vitality of our society. Whether in government, business, education, the military, science, technology, or the arts, Asian Pacific Americans bring to our society a rich cultural heritage representing many languages, ethnicities, and religious traditions.Diversity represents one of our country's greatest strengths. I am honored to represent the State of Hawaii in Congress. Much of the character of my State and district is a result of the great diversity Asian Pacific Americans have brought to our country. I hope all Americans recognize the contributions these groups have made to our national identity and culture.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of The Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park was authorized by Congress nearly 50 years ago to preserve a truly unique relic of Hawaiian history and culture. Up until the early 19th century, Hawaiians who broke the ancient code of law could avoid an otherwise certain death by fleeting to this place of refuge, or pu'uhonua, for absolution and clemency. Defeated warriors and non-combatants could also seek refuge here during times of battle. It is this function that gave this park its name, City of Refuge, which was later changed to Pu'uhonua o Honaunau.In addition to the refuge, which is enclosed by a great wall, the surrounding land also housed several generations of powerful Hawaiian chiefs, adding to the area's great historical value. The pu'uhonua and royal grounds are still considered sacred by native Hawaiians and the sites draw a half million visitors each year who come in search of the vast cultural, spiritual, educational, and recreational opportunities the park has to offer. Visitors can attend cultural demonstrations of traditional Hawaiian arts and crafts, hike along the historic 1871 Trail to several archaeological sites, observe wildlife such as the endangered green sea turtles in Keone Ele cove, or snorkel in the clear waters of Honaunau Bay.When the National Historic Park was established in 1955, nearly two-thirds of the ancient village of Ki'ilae remained undiscovered and outside of the park in a single private ownership. Recently, the approximately 238-acre Honaunau tract, which contains the balance of the Ki'ilae Village site and a human habitation record stretching back nearly a thousand years, became available for acquisition. This property is extremely rich in pre-history, and provides important clues about ancient Hawaiian life. Agricultural structures, stone piles, and walls are interspersed among recreational sites and the burial sites of the villagers. Acquisition of this area is crucial to protect extraordinary early Hawaiian cultural sites and expand the public understanding and interpretation of cultural traditions and Hawaiian subsistence patterns. This public acquisition will safeguard this important glimpse into early Hawaiian village life and social dynamics.It is important to note that the acquisition and expansion of Pu'uhonua o Honaunau is overwhelmingly supported by the National Park Service, the County of Hawaii, and the local community. In addition, an identical version of H.R. 1906 has already passed the Senate in the form of S. 1057. All that remains is the passage of H.R. 1906 in the House of Representatives.I urge my colleagues to protect these ancient Hawaiian cultural sites and support this legislation.",

Nonetheless, we are here today under the present rules asking merely for the compensation that is due us under the treaty obligation of the United States.It is not fair to ask a State of the Union to undertake expenditures that are engendered as a result of the actions of the United States of America, nor is it fair to ask any of the territories or the Commonwealth of Marianas to assume the same costs. This is particularly true when the three entities are suffering from the decline in tourism dollars and revenue that has come in. The fact that we have borne this burden for this time should not give rise to any consideration or thought that this has been something that is equitable.So I would hope that the membership would understand, as we conclude our deliberations on the bill, that this is an amount of money that is but a minuscule portion of that which is due Guam, American Samoa, the Marianas and the State of Hawaii.The CHAIRMAN.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I take this action. The hearts of all of us here go out in sympathy to Patsy's husband, John, and her daughter, Gwen; to her brother, Eugene; to her staff in Washington and in Hawaii; and to her large family of friends and admirers.Mr. Speaker, I am devastated by her loss. Patsy Mink was more than my friend and my colleague; she was a true daughter of Hawaii. She was a person of enormous spirit and tenacity and inner strength. I will miss her terribly. I will especially miss her wisdom, her energy, her readiness to fight for principle. She fought all her life for social and economic justice.Throughout nearly 50 years of public service, she championed America's most deeply held values: equality, fairness, above all honesty. Her courage, her willingness to speak out and champion causes that others might shun resulted in tremendous contributions in the fields of civil rights and education. She has earned in my estimation an honored place in the history of the United States House of Representatives as the co-author of title IX, which guarantees equality for women in education programs.Every single woman in this Nation who today has the advantage of the capacity to command equal opportunity in education, and by extension in virtually every other field of endeavor, owes the impetus to that in modern times to Patsy Mink. She was one of the pioneers who transformed Hawaii and transformed this Nation. Her legacy will live on in every campus in America and in the heart of every American woman who aspires to greatness. Most profoundly, it lives on in my estimation in hope, hope for the millions of lives that she touched.Mr. Speaker, it is difficult for me to realize that I am standing here this evening paying my respects to the memory of Patsy Mink because my first memories of her go back to when I was a student at the University of Hawaii involved in one of her first campaigns, not for elective office because she did that when Hawaii was still a territory.She came back to Hawaii from her early plantation days, running around as a little kid in the plantation ditches over in Maui, encouraged by her family, most particularly her father, to reach for her star in the Hawaii firmament.She was turned down for medical school, discriminated against because she was female, because she was Japanese, because she came from an unknown territory out in the Pacific. That is why she went to law school, fought her way into law school so that she could achieve a degree that would enable her to fight against the discrimination she had suffered.She was a champion then. We all recognized it. She was smart and she was tough and she was articulate and she would not quit. She was an inspiration then and now.Whenever any of us felt some sense of discouragement, whenever any of us felt some sense of despair or feeling that we could not succeed, it was only required for Patsy to come in the room to change the atmosphere.Patsy Mink had the capacity to make dead air move. Patsy Mink, this little lady from Hawaii, was a giant in her heart and in her commitment. With every breath that she took, she championed those who had no one to stand up and speak out for them. A little lady with a big heart, a lioness. We will not see her like again. Someone will take her place here in the House, that is the way of it in our democracy, but no one will replace her in the hearts of the people of Hawaii. No one will replace her in the role that she played in this House of Representatives. No one was more beloved than Patsy Mink in this House.Mr. Speaker, as an expression of the gravity of the feelings of the Members of this House, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), whom I think has an opportunity for Members of the House to be able to express in a more concrete fashion the feelings that we all have for Patsy.",

I had not intended to speak much further because of the eloquent, articulate, certainly comprehensive manner in which the Members tonight have discussed the great contributions of Patsy to this body and to the Nation. But all through this evening, Mr. Speaker, I have been unable to avoid looking at the picture that has been down by the podium on the floor. That picture of Patsy really captures the essence of this tiny giant. You can see her steadfastness, her sense of perseverance, the stalwart person that she was on behalf of all those who had no hope.Mr. Speaker, it never occurred to me in my youth that I would have the honor and privilege of serving in the people's house, the House of Representatives. I look around the floor at my colleagues here. I see my dear friend Dana Rohrabacher and others here on the floor; Nancy Pelosi, who has just finished speaking of her friendship and love for Patsy, and I understand what it was that I knew intellectually so many years ago when I worked on Patsy's first campaign as a college student at the University of Hawaii when she first came here to the House of Representatives. I understood intellectually what it was to serve in the House of Representatives. But I am sure, Mr. Speaker, you know, as all of our colleagues do here in the people's house, that those of us who have sworn an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution in this house of freedom know what it means to have had the presence of someone like Patsy Mink.Surely, Mr. Speaker, there is no other people so fortunate as we, free men and women, in the freest country on the face of the Earth, in the history of the planet. No one has embodied more the spirit of this House than this gentlewoman from Hawaii, a true daughter of Hawaii who celebrated in herself and in her service the true spirit and meaning of aloha.Aloha means that our diversity defines us rather than divides us. In this world of adversity and pain and terror and cruelty and horror, Patsy Mink was able to stand for those who could not speak for themselves and was the living embodiment of what aloha meant not just for our Rainbow State, not just for our multicultural, multiethnic, multiracial people, but it gave the message of aloha to this House, to this Nation and to this world.Aloha, Patsy.Mr. Speaker, I believe that the time is appropriate to call for an expression of assent to the resolution before us, and if I could ask for that to be in the form of Members rising, Members and those present to rise with a moment of silence not only in commemoration of Patsy Mink, but to constitute passage of the resolution.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join in paying tribute to a great American. Former Congressman Augustus Hawkins was not only a pioneer in breaking a race barrier of the House of Representatives, he was also a pioneer in economic and unemployment reform.Congressman Hawkins was well respected by both sides of the aisle for his sincerity, dedication hard work, and commitment to helping those less fortunate. He sponsored numerous laws that created jobs and insured civil rights. He was a forceful advocate of Federal support of education.During his years in Congress, Mr. Hawkins' most notable accomplishments included the establishment of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978.Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues in wishing Congressman Hawkins a happy 95th birthday, which he celebrated earlier this year. it is fitting that we name a postal facility after Congressman Hawkins so that Californians and Americans can long remember his legacy. Let us not only look back at his accomplishments and his patriotism, let us look forward and wish him many more healthy and happy years.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for this resolution and to thank the leadership of the House for moving so expeditiously to bring it to the floor.I have had the honor to share the responsibility of representing Hawaii in the U.S. House of Representatives with Patsy Mink for the last 12 years. However, my first memories of her go back 40 years when I was a student at the University of Hawaii involved in one of her early campaigns. I admired her then and I hope through this resolution to secure for her an honored place in the history of this institution and this country.Throughout nearly 50 years of public service, Patsy Mink championed America's most deeply held values: equality, fairness, and above all honesty. Her courage, her willingness to speak out and champion causes that others might shun resulted in tremendous contributions in the fields of civil rights and education. Every single woman in this Nation who today has been given an equal opportunity in education, and by extension in virtually every other field of endeavor, owes the impetus to that in modern times to Patsy Mink. She was one of the pioneers who transformed Hawaii and transformed this Nation. Her legacy will live on in every campus in America and in the heart of every American woman who aspires to greatness. Most profoundly, it lives on in my estimation in hope; hope for the millions of lives that she touched.Someone will take Patsy Mink's place here in the House, that is the way of it in our democracy, but no one will replace her in the hearts of the people of Hawaii. No one will replace her in the role that she played in this House of Representatives. With the renaming of title IX as the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act, Congress secures her memory as a heroic, visionary, and tireless leader of this great Nation.",

    "title": "FUNDING HOMELAND SECURITY",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I would like to join my colleagues in urging the House to increase the amounts we will include in the supplemental appropriations bill later this week for homeland security. Last Friday I held a meeting in Honolulu of first responders to discuss preparedness, planning and coordination among agencies and funding needs. It became very apparent during the meeting that funding being received is clearly inadequate to undertake the job we are asking of our emergency law enforcement agencies and personnel.For example, the Honolulu Police Department has apprised me of the need for some $65.5 million for several projects that are necessary if the Island of Oahu is to be protected to the extent necessary. There are several important military installations for which Honolulu police have major responsibilities, such as Pearl Harbor Naval Base, Hickam Air Force Base, and Schofield Barracks. The Department has the responsibility for the safety of military personnel and their family who live off base, and to some extent on base. Specifically, communication and operability between civilian law enforcement and the military is essential. Additional personnel protective equipment has been identified as a need as well as emergency vehicles in a centralized equipment and maintenance facility.The cost for effective homeland security management is a huge, unfunded mandate the Federal Government has imposed on State and local governments. The Honolulu Police Department is establishing an Emergency Management Command and an antiterrorism unit. It is undertaking extensive specialized training in areas such as chemical, biological, and explosive handling. Joint exercises with the military have been conducted so that in the event of an emergency, roles are recognized and responsibilities are familiar.Our state of affairs and level of protection afforded to our citizens changed greatly after September 11, and has been heightened by our military engagement in Iraq. Our citizens expect and deserve such elevated security. But it also serves to remind us that protection is not cheap, and we in Congress should stand up to our responsibilities to properly fund the protections our citizens need.I would like to join my colleagues in urging the House to increase the amounts we will include in the supplemental appropriation bill later in this week for homeland security.Last Friday, I held a meeting in Honolulu of first responders, to discuss preparedness, planning and coordination among agencies, and funding needs.

Joint exercises with the military have been conducted so that in the event of an emergency, roles are recognized and responsibilities are familiar.There are other imbedded homeland security costs with which state and local officials are struggling. When the Nation moves to a Code Red Alert posture, the Honolulu police incur costs of over $1.5 million a day, about two-thirds of it for the protection of critical infrastructure for military installations.The Oahu Civil Defense Agency has identified numerous critical projects which total $18.1 million. Essential projects include warning siren upgrades, security cameras, computer software, as well as equipment and personnel training.These statistics are for but two of numerous first responder agencies. This does not include the fire department, nor the burdens placed on hospitals and emergency rooms. And the Hawaii State Government has separate and additional mandates and responsibilities.I'm not speaking today to point fingers of blame at anyone for the situation we face, but to articulate the need to provide adequate funding in the supplemental appropriations bill.Our state of affairs and level of protection afforded to our citizens changed greatly after September 11 and has been heightened by our military engagement in Iraq. Our citizens expect and deserve such elevated security.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that this House is marking Asian Pacific American Heritage month. For those of us from the State of Hawaii, there is something missing in this year's Heritage Month celebration--the dynamic presence of our colleague, Patsy Takemoto Mink. I would like to take this opportunity, therefore, to reprise the tribute to her that I delivered on this floor last October.We were devastated by the sudden loss of this irreplaceable woman.Patsy Mink was the first Asian American woman to serve in Congress. But she was much more than that. She was our friend and colleague. She was a true daughter of Hawaii. She was a person of enormous spirit and tenacity and inner strength. This House is much the poorer for her loss. We especially miss her wisdom, her energy, her readiness to fight for principle.As evidence of the high esteem in which she was held in Hawaii, she was elected over and over by the voters of Hawaii, and she was re-elected posthumously after she passed away just before the 2002 election.Patsy fought all her life for social and economic justice. Throughout nearly 50 years of public service, she championed America's most deeply held values: equality, fairness, and above all . . . honesty.Her courage, her willingness to speak out and champion causes that others might shun resulted in tremendous contributions in the fields of civil rights and education.She has earned an honored place in the history of the United States House of Representatives as the co-author of title IX, which guarantees equality for women in education programs.Every single woman in this Nation who today access to equal opportunity in education, and by extension in virtually every other field of endeavor, owes a debt to Patsy Mink.She was one of the pioneers who transformed Hawaii and transformed this Nation. Her legacy lives on in every campus in America and in the heart of every American woman who aspires to greatness. Most profoundly, it lives on in the spirit of hope, hope for the millions of lives that she touched. Patsy Mink knew first hand the power of hope, the power of perseverence, the power of dreams.She was turned down for medical school, discriminated against because she was female, because she was Japanese American, because she came from an unknown territory out in the Pacific.That is why she went to law school, fought her way into law school so that she could achieve a degree that would enable her to fight against the discrimination she had suffered. She was a champion then. We all recognized it. She was smart and she was tough and she was articulate and she would not quit. She was an inspiration then and now. Whenever any of us felt some sense of discouragement, whenever any of us felt some sense of despair or feeling that we could not succeed, it was only required for Patsy to come in the room to change the atmosphere.Patsy Mink had the capacity to make dead air move. Patsy Mink, this little lady from Hawaii, was a giant in her heart and in her commitment.With every breath that she took, she championed those who had no one to stand up and speak out for them. A little lady with a big heart, a lioness.We will not see her like again.",

I could not possibly even begin to do that. Forty-three years of my life was involved with Patsy when I was a student and supporter of hers, and then as a colleague. To say that the people coming down to this floor loved Patsy, admired her and respected her, hardly does justice to those words.There will never, ever be another person on this floor like Patsy Mink. When the history of the House of Representatives is written, she will be in the pantheon of heroes, those who exemplify the People's House. If there was ever anyone who embodied what it was that made this country great, someone who came from immigrant circumstances to the highest echelons of government, and never forgot where she came from and who she was and what and who she represented, it was Patsy Mink.She was more than a friend and more than a colleague. She was a beacon to all of us who serve here hope to be. We all take our oath of office here to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, and we are only here because of the faith and trust of the people in our districts. Never, ever, has anyone upheld better that faith and trust that our constituents have given to us than Patsy Mink. Patsy, you live with us and you live in this House, the people's House, forever.",

But I think perhaps not everyone recognized or understood until they came to Hawaii and had the opportunity to see from whence Hawaii Patsy came as to what molded her as a person.For the young people that are here today observing the remarks here on the floor, they may not fully comprehend what it was to be female and Japanese-American and smart and have to try and come up. We take a lot of these things for granted. She was in fact the pioneer, not just in Hawaii but throughout the Nation, for indicating what could be accomplished with those kinds of strikes against her. She turned that adversity into accomplishment. For that reason, if for that reason alone, she stands as the standard for which every young woman and every young man who comes from humble circumstances can aspire. With Patsy Mink, you had someone who was not just a friend, not someone who was just a standard bearer, but you had someone who set the foundation for all those who came after.",

I cannot see trying to kick people off the elevators who are citizens, trying to come see us, who operate in good faith, and we cannot get here to vote.Now if you are so anxious to get this thing done in 15 minutes or 17 or whatever it is, that is fine. I will do my best, as I am sure everybody else will; but, Mr. Speaker, you have got to see to it then that we are able to get to do this in the manner in which we are supposedly designated to do it.If you have elevators that are supposed to be for us during this time, then you are going to have to do things to see we can use them. I am not the only one who was disenabled from voting because I simply could not get down here. I could not get here fast enough because these elevators are stuck, and there are all kinds of people on them asking directions and you cannot get down here.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, on that point, or on these series of points that are being made, for all intents and purposes, the only opportunity that the American people are going to have to have these questions explicated is on this floor during special orders, and I want to indicate, and I believe the three of us are agreed upon this, we are going to be back. Arnold Schwarzenegger is not the only one that is going to be back.We are going to be back here on this floor. We are going to be asking the questions. We are going to be making the observations. We are going to be putting forward for the American people the opportunity to hear a perspective that is not necessarily or likely to be enunciated in the press, most particularly in the controlled press. We are not going to see this on the evening news. We are not going to see this in the so-called Sunday talk shows. They have the usual suspects on generally when that comes about.So what I want to do this evening by way of establishing some of the premise is refer back again to the congressional delegation that we made May 23 through the 27 under the chairmanship of the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), my good friend, our good friend, our able chairman, someone dedicated to the defense of this country by any standard of measure.Of course, there are differences of opinion that we have in the Committee on Armed Services on which I am happy to be serving as to what the policies might or might not be with respect to the defense of the strategic interests of this Nation, but there is no difference between us on either our desire or our capabilities or our abilities to try to discern what the best course might be. That is precisely why we went. We did not go there to try and get into a contest with anybody on an ideological basis or party basis but rather to try to find out what was taking place.Maybe tonight will be the first time people will be able to hear anything about what was known as the Organization for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, which has now become the Coalition Provisional Authority. These are important because we started out one way with a former general, Jay Garner, who has now been removed all of the sudden within almost days, weeks, in terms of workdays, just days, has been removed, and why? Not because General Garner was thought to be a bad person or an inadequate administrator or did not have the proper motivation or understanding, but because the mission to which he had been assigned and the mission which he expected to carry out, namely, a reconstruction effort, somewhat perhaps akin to the aftermath of a natural disaster, a dam bursting or a hurricane or typhoon or something of that nature, turned out to be a typhoon of entirely a different kind, namely, that there was chaos; that there was an inability to provide even the most elemental of protection for those who would be doing the reconstruction; that there was not an understanding and foundation in the population in which this reconstruction was supposed to take place that this was a mutually agreed-upon activity.There were forces in the street that were, in fact, trying already to get the United States out of Iraq, and therefore, we had to have the intervention of a very competent and highly professional diplomat, Mr. Bremer, Mr. Paul Bremer, who came in and assumed the authority over what has become the Coalition Provisional Authority. What did he propose?When we went to Baghdad to talk with him, he had put together what I called an outline. Some people would call this a plan, but I think Mr. Bremer is an honest and forthright person. I was very impressed with his desire to speak directly to us on the questions that we posed and the observations that we made. He did not try to finesse anything. He did not try to make anything into something other than what he thought it was. He gave that clear impression, and I think that was agreed upon by all Members there, Democrats and Republicans, who were there.He came up with what could best be characterized as an outline, not a plan. A plan is something that we know how to implement, we know who is going to implement it, we know where it is going to be done. We did not know any of these things. We still do not know these things. We are making it up as we go along. This is not an accusation, as the gentleman indicates, against Mr. Bremer. On the contrary he is trying to put something together that was not planned for.This is one of the key elements that we have to think about here when we are talking about we can have authority as General Shinseki said when he retired as Army Chief of Staff on June 11, you can be assigned command authority but you have to earn leadership.The question here that has to be answered by the President, by the Department of Defense, by Mr. Rumsfeld and others is, are they really exercising the kind of leadership that we need in these circumstances? We cannot equate a political policy with patriotism. If you are trying to tell me, and this is where I draw the line here, if you are trying to tell me that I have to agree with somebody else's political policy or have my patriotism questioned or have my capacity to understand what the strategic interests of this Nation are, then you have crossed over the line, and what you are saying in effect is do not examine closely, do not analyze to any great degree the policies that I am putting forward because if you do then I will equate that with somehow being antipatriotic or against our troops.If we are putting the lives of young men and women and the United States Armed Forces on the line, then we have to have policies that are worthy of the commitment and dedication and professionalism of those young people.I got into electoral politics because we failed to do that in the Vietnam War because we decided then that we would equate military activity with political policy, and the military activity became the political policy. That is why we got to body counts in Vietnam to try and justify our insistence on being there militarily, and so we have to account for the key tasks to be completed here in the context of does this advance the interests of the United States at this juncture, pending some further inquiry as to how we got there in the first place.And I will tell you that while these, in and of themselves, these 10 points of Ambassador Bremer to be completed, are worthy in and of themselves, they do not answer the question about what will be the role of the United States over the next 5 to 10 years, at least a decade.And this is where General Shinseki's words become ringing in terms of his retirement and what he said at that retirement about command authority and earning leadership capacity. He said that there should be no confusion about the argument over what the military should be doing or not doing in this country and what its role is going to be in the post-attack phase in the context of the guerilla war that is now underway in Iraq. There should be no confusion as to the commitment of the United States military to civilian control. To raise these issues as to who was in charge is dysfunctional to the discussion. But he warned us, and these words are going to be prophetic, do not get involved in a 12-division policy with a 10-division army.And what he was saying here is, were we adequately prepared ahead of time? Did we do the kind of planning that was necessary in order to accomplish this task? And was that mission that was outlined adequately underlined and a foundation established that would enable us to say with authority that the interests of the United States in terms of its strategic position in the world and whether or not we were facing imminent danger was in fact at stake? Absent that, then we are in for serious trouble. Because that means we will be engaged in essentially an ad hoc operation perhaps for over a decade to come in Iraq, and we will pay a fearful price for that in the lives and bloodshed of our American military and upon the taxpayers of this country and upon the credibility of the United States with regard to world opinion.",

    "text": "Well, Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield to me on that point, Ambassador Bremer was very, very direct in his characterization of us being an occupying power. And this was not said with any kind of bravado. It was simply an announcement of the realities that were involved and what his obligations were and what his responsibilities were in Iraq as the director of the coalition provisional authority.And we ought to get something straight here about this. When we say coalition, we are talking about the United States of America. That is who is in charge here. When the Americans show up, then people mean business. I remember that from the Balkan situation before. And just by way of disclosure, on that I opposed President Clinton on that. So again I point out this has nothing to do with Democrats and Republicans, whether they are in the Presidency or not. This has to do with credibility in terms of whether or not the national interests are involved and to what degree they are involved. As a result, I think that we need to understand very clearly what Ambassador Bremer's dilemma is and what is he to do at this stage when contemplating how to advance civil society.Now let us talk about the practical consequences of this. There is a reason that young men and women are being killed or wounded almost daily in Iraq today. We have no civil authority in place. When those who criticize those of us who were aware of this attack taking place under the terms and conditions and time that it took place, when they complain about, well, are you now ready to admit that you lost; that somehow we won and you thought we were going to lose. As my colleague from Pennsylvania pointed out, I do not know of anyone, certainly not any responsible person in the Congress, and I cannot think of anybody in the Committee on Armed Services that thought for a moment that the United States military would not succeed. We only have to observe them in action, as we have as recently on this trip at the end of May, to see that the professionalism, the capacity, the capabilities of the United States military is unparalleled.That is not the question. The question is are the politicians and the politics behind the military activity up to the mark. That is what is at stake here. And that is why we have the situation in which these young people are being shot, are being wounded, are being put in harm's way every day. There is no civil authority there. We are trying to stand up a police force.Does that sound familiar? It should, because we have been trying to do it since the late 1990s in the Balkans; and we are still, despite much more favorable circumstances in, at best, a very tentative dilemma with respect to whether or not with the NATO troops and United States troops leaving that area, whether or not chaos will descend once again. I will assure my colleagues if we leave any time soon, there will be chaos of a nature that the Secretary of Defense calls untidy.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield, that just goes to show that the interests of the United States at that time were deemed to be such that we could have that kind of diplomatic relationships with Saddam Hussein and the government in Iraq. The present Secretary of Defense was part of that, was in Iraq and trying to do business with Saddam Hussein.The question is what caused that change? Was it really in the interest of the United States in terms of our defense and imminent danger to the United States to attack Iraq? That is a question that needs to be answered because it is going to inform us and instruct us where we are going from here, whether it is Iran, Syria, North Korea, whether it is the kind of policies that are going to come forward on Iraq itself. This is the kind of thing that needs not just an emphasis but needs explanation.If we are going to have a policy worthy of the legacy of this Nation's triumph of democracy, we cannot simply assert it on behalf of other people, particularly in a place like Iraq which has never known it and whose entire history since World War I has been nothing but a division of the spoils among Western nations.Mr. Speaker, I simply want to indicate to my colleagues, and I hope that we will have a dialogue in the future, particularly with those who have different views as to where we should be going and what we have accomplished to this point, or what we have failed to accomplish to this point, because it is the only place that the American people are going to get any kind of a dialogue like that. That is what this House is all about. This is the people's House. You cannot appear on this floor except by way of election. You can be appointed to the United States Senate; you cannot be appointed to the House of Representatives. This is the people's House. We come up for election, as my wife says, every other year, not every 2 years. You can have a driver's license longer than you can have a license to be on this floor, and that is as it should be because it was the intention of the Founders of this Nation that the people in this country have the opportunity to decide who will represent them here against the House of Lords on the other side of the building.I would indicate that I will be coming back to the floor, and I hope to be joined by others because we do not intend to let this issue slide. We do not intend for anybody to get over this or get by it.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I want to assure our colleagues as well as those who may be observing and listening to us that we do not intend to make this a 1- or 2- or 3-time deal.This is not two or three Members of Congress off on some individual crusade. We are not here simply to recount those things with which we have a disagreement. What we feel very strongly about is what I believe is the views of the overwhelming majority of the people of the United States and most certainly those who have talked to me about that Members of Congress have not stepped up to the plate with regard to the discussion of these issues in illuminating what is at stake for this country, and that right now some of these corporation-controlled media networks and the organs of the executive government are controlling the message that is out there, and only free men and women, freely elected with the faith and trust of the electorate, the people have put us into these positions of trust here in the people's House.It is up to us with that kind of an obligation placed upon us by the people to speak out and to speak up, to speak forthrightly, to speak with as much knowledge as we can bring to bear, to exercise such judgment as we are able to bring to bear, and to keep the people of this country informed, and to let them know that we will not be silenced in this, that we are going to be back night after night after night, and that if we cannot get these issues discussed during the regular business of the day, then rest assured we will be here in the Special Orders that are given to us here in the people's House to make certain that the hammer of truth is going to come down on the anvil of inquiry that is required of a free people in a democratic society.We are going to return here again. We invite our colleagues to engage in this colloquy. We invite our colleagues to come forward and express their views. We invite our colleagues to come forth and make inquiry of one another so that we can be better informed ourselves, so that we do not have a circumstance that comes to fruition again in this Nation such as we experienced in Vietnam.If anything motivates me to be down here on this floor, I see parallels. I am not drawing analogies, but I see parallels, distinctly fearful parallels, to what took place in Vietnam in which we were urged to keep quiet, in which we were urged not to say anything for fear it would be called dissent, as if there was already an understanding as to what the correct position should be when it comes to issue of life and death as we face now in Iraq and other places where American troops are deployed.I believe it is an absolute necessity of democracy that we have the fullest and freest and the deepest and with the widest breadth of discussion that it is possible to have, and that is what we are going to be doing on this floor.",

While we cannot have schools built in this country, while we cannot have hospitals paid for, when we cannot get health care for our people, who benefits? Who is getting the contracts for this? Who is getting the no-bid contracts? Where is the money coming from? Supposedly from the oil revenues. Oil revenues then will be passing right out of Iraq and down to Texas, to Haliburton Company, to some of the other construction companies that are benefiting from hundreds of millions of dollars that are now being allocated into their pockets directly for this reconstruction, not in the United States but in Iraq.",

    "text": "Again in furtherance of what the gentleman from Illinois has indicated and others here this evening, these are the same questions that many of us asked of President Clinton. This is not something that has suddenly sprung into being. And they were asked in a bipartisan basis, too.My colleagues will remember that some of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, had these same questions for President Clinton with respect to Kosovo, with respect to the activities that took place in the Balkans. We had these same questions of ourselves as to what was expected of us. I think that as a result, what the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) has indicated is perhaps a start for us in terms of the questions that need to be asked, I think, needs a bit of reiteration.I find it very strange that when President Carter was in office, people in the media, particularly Nightline, would come on every evening, day 292 of the hostages and the number of hostages that were still in Iran, on day 292, three, four, five, 300, whatever it was. Yet we go now to casualties, deaths, we are not talking about those that are maimed, and this casual dismissal by some of the, I am sorry to say, some of the highest officials in the administration now of, well, this is all over, intelligence changes from day to day. You never know what it is from day to day, this almost sarcastic dismissal of these questions.There are young people out at Walter Reed right now who may not have been killed, a casualty in that sense, but they are surely there as casualties, with loss of limbs and a lifetime in front of them of having to deal with the pain and suffering of grievous wounds. Perhaps Nightline might take up this idea. It is day, what number, since the President said that the war was over.This is not something that we said. This is not something that other people said. This is something the President declared, and some of us have been challenged on our patriotism and challenged on our support for troops because we are not sufficiently quiet, because we do not acknowledge that the so-called ending of the war really ended.It does not end when somebody dies. It does not end when somebody is grievously wounded. It does not end when a parent or loved one has to try and understand and we have to explain when we go home why the war is over but the killing goes on and the maiming goes on.So I think we are going to need to have some accounting as to how many days past the end of the war the killing and the maiming goes on and what those numbers are. Because those numbers are real. They are not philosophical abstractions. They are not merely the recitation of numbers from an Office of Management and Budget or a Congressional Budget Office, some entity, some institution that has no reality to the mothers and fathers and the loved ones of those who have to bear the brunt of the policies that we in the government of the United States are bringing forward to the people of the United States as being in the strategic interests of this Nation.So I think that the questions that are being asked are not just questions about the past and how something happened but to try and understand what took place in the past so that we do not continue to make the same mistakes and the same observations that lead to this kind of grievous result.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, on that point in reference to what the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) said and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) observed to kick off this discussion, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) can see, his question was so pertinent that we have not gotten much further in it, and for good reason, because it requires some explication. The problem is here, if we do not do this, is a credibility gap. What will the President be able to say about North Korea? What will he be able to say about the Philippines? What will he be able to say about Colombia? What will he be able to say further about Afghanistan?Afghanistan seems to have disappeared; yet I know there were two attacks yesterday, one on the American base and one on U.N. personnel. I do not believe anybody was killed, but who knows? Now we are told there are more attacks in Iraq than necessarily are being reported. I suppose that gets quotidian now. If they are on the 11 o'clock news at night, they have got fires to report, they have assaults to report or basketball players or the latest boxer to embarrass himself or something of that nature. They hardly have time to fit in anymore how many people got killed today. It is almost a loss leader in the news.And so if we do not have some answers here, if the President does not take control and stop being dismissive of these questions as merely revising history or some other sarcastic observation, he is not going to be able nor will the administration be able to convince others who may find it in their interest to join with us in other circumstances. He will not be able to find anyone who is going to be willing to take us at our word. That is why this is so serious. It is way beyond partisan. Other people will occupy these seats down here. Other people will come to occupy our place. We are here only as long as the faith and trust of the people in our constituencies are willing to put us here. No one owns a seat in this Congress. No one owns a seat at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue either. We are only as good as the credibility with our own people before we can hope to influence others.",

    "text": "The question that you pose and was answered rhetorically with another series of questions, really observations by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel), I think bear answering. I think there is an answer and it is an unfortunate answer. It has nothing to do with plots and conspiracies, but it has everything to do with a philosophy and an attitude and an ideology which has been expressed again and again by some of the people that have been mentioned here earlier this evening. If you take a look at the spectrum of essays and books and articles written by those who were now in charge of policy in the administration, Mr. Krystol's book on the mission in Iraq, our mission in Iraq, Mr. Perle, Mr. Booth, some of the think tanks here in Washington, these nonprofit, untaxable think tanks that operate thanks to the tax loopholes that we have which allow them to operate and comment and infest themselves in halls of government. There are more than one set of interest groups in this town, let me state, and some of them are in charge of this policy. So the answer, I am sorry to say, in my judgment is this has been a clearly articulated policy of people now associated with the administrations who were determined to start a war in Iraq, to include Syria and Iran, because of the policies that they feel this country should be not only espousing but pursuing in terms of world domination beginning in the Middle East. So it is clear, even with the publishing of the documentation now over the weekend, that the bombing that took place for perhaps a year or more before the actual launching of the attack on Baghdad was following a pattern to try to knock out selected targets in Iraq before the formal hostilities in terms of an attack actually started. So I think I am forced to conclude, and this is why I think the idea of having an independent investigation committee is so important, I am forced to conclude that there was a pattern already being articulated publicly and in writing to set this Nation on a course of imperial attack beginning with Iraq. Mr. HOEFFEL. We wanted to hear from the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee), but it looks like the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel) has 60 seconds here. Mr. EMANUEL. I wanted to make two closing comments on my side on this point. One, I think we have a serious problem with North Korea. There is no doubt North Korea is on the verge of developing nuclear weapons, and unless America's word and its credibility can be trusted, our ability to muster the international community's outrage and capability to handle this will be questioned. Unfortunately, the President's State of the Union has called the question of our credibility and our ability to muster in the international community when it says this was an immediate threat. I think the American people, unfortunately, because of this now, are exhausted in dealing with the international crisis which we will have to do. Secondly, what I want to report and talk about in this group is dealing with the cost. We are paying $1 billion a week for the occupation of Iraq. There was a story two nights ago, four nights ago on the nightly news of how our troops are now organizing soccer teams in Iraq and sports in Iraq for the young.",

Because what we are doing can easily be dismissed by those who want to color it with a brush that has politics all over it, and that is not what this is about. It is not about politics in the sense that we are trying to make some particularly partisan point. I notice in the photographs coming from the rehabilitation wards right here in Washington, DC that the young men and women who have been grievously wounded are not identified as Republicans and Democrats or supporters of a particular policy or not. These are the people that have had to pay the price for other people's arrogance. These are the people that have had to pay the real price. We are not paying any price here. We all know that someone else will occupy these slots one day. I learned that the first time I was elected when I went to the office to which I was assigned and I realized they slid the names off the door.They were not screwed on, painted on; they came right off the door. We occupy that only so long as we have the faith and trust of the people of this country. That is what is at stake here. That is what this inquiry is all about. Is our faith and trust being played fast and loose with? That is the issue that is involved. That is why I want to say that as far as I am concerned, we are going to continue these inquiries. This Iraq Watch I hope perhaps can come out into the country, maybe off the floor of the Congress and perhaps go elsewhere. I would be very pleased to take this inquiry perhaps into a town meeting-kind of context anywhere in the Nation so that we can break out of the stranglehold on opinion that is taking place right now. We cannot trust the national media to do it. They are in the grip of the people who own the networks. We cannot trust them. We have to trust the people out there. And so I hope that perhaps with Iraq Watch, we can go elsewhere and go directly to the people, and we can get streaming on the Internet and follow through and let people judge for themselves on the people's network that is out there. Mr. HOEFFEL. I think that is a wonderful suggestion. Mr. INSLEE. A brief comment. I went and visited with two Marines who had some pretty significant wounds at Bethesda awhile back serving in Iraq. One was crushed by a tank and one was shot. I just think that those gentlemen understood the value of democracy and what we are here today is to say the Congress needs to understand the value of democracy, and democracy does not work where the executive branch of the United States Government does not level with its own people. I have one question for our next week that I hope we would have answered. Why did the White House in the run-up to the war in Iraq not seek CIA approval before the President of the United States went to the Rose Garden and charged that Saddam Hussein could launch a biological or chemical attack within 45 minutes as administration officials now say? That is a question every American deserves an answer to, and the best way to do it is through Republicans and Democrats working together; and I hope this commission does that. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his leadership.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, not only was that well stated, not only was the logistics of the politics well stated, but the sentiments expressed by yourself and by the previous speakers take us then to the question of what are we to do? The difficulty I think that has been faced by those of us who had reservations, if not outright opposition, to the attack on Baghdad, which is what the initial military activity was, because we feared that a war in Iraq would then erupt, one for which we were not prepared, I think the difficulties associated with the thrust of their remarks made to this point is that the American people said, well, where is this opposition, what does it mean, why are we not coming forward with it?We were drowned, literally, in the rhetorical excesses and visual stimulus of embedded media, following along with and literally with the troops. We were regaled with admonitions to support the troops by virtue of not questioning the policies that sent those troops in in the first place, and not analyzing the context and circumstances under which those troops were placed in harm's way. And I do not think we can avoid that any longer.How are we to deal with the analysis of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) regarding the circumstances under which we entered and what has taken place? How are we to deal with the questions raised by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) about the deficits, about the costs that are associated, the literal costs? How are we to deal with the elegant formulation by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel) of the juxtaposition between that which is required for us in the United States to deal with our basic needs and that which is required for the Iraqi people under the circumstances over which we now, ostensibly, have control and obligation? What are we to do?The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) and I, earlier this evening, engaged in a discussion with one another about, well, how should we address this question? And I think, if my colleague will allow me just a moment or two more, I want to posit what I think needs to be done or at least what needs to be done in terms of a dialogue.We established a governing cabinet which, according to The New York Times yesterday, is the Iraqi Governing Council. It says we have right now, and by we I am talking about the so-called coalition, because that is all it is. There may be some attendance on the periphery, but we have Great Britain, and we have the United States. Great Britain is now going through the throes of its own investigations and self-analysis. Who knows how long the Prime Minister will even be in office, let alone the support there. But it says we now have an Iraqi Governing Council, I am quoting The New York Times from yesterday, ``appointed a 25-member cabinet today to begin taking over day-to-day control of the government. The Iraqi ministers appointed today are to take over important portfolios in foreign affairs, finance, internal security and oil.''Now, my suggestion is if that is in fact the case, and if one accepts the premise for discussion sake that the motives for going into Iraq were sound, even if the process and the planning was inadequate at best, then this has been achieved. There was an attack on Baghdad. There was an occupation that took place. We now have a 25-member governing council to take over all of these areas. When are we going to bring the troops home?The same paper announces, the same news media announces yesterday that two U.S. military officers have died, another wounded when their Humvee hit a bomb along a highway in southern Baghdad. The military police brigade was traveling along a main supply route at 3:19 p.m. in the afternoon when their vehicle hit ``an improvised explosive device.''",

There are plenty of people who want to show up for work, but the work is not there because it is being out sourced overseas. Because we are providing an opportunity for the Vice President's cronies in Halliburton and all these other construction companies to send mercenaries overseas to make the big dollars off of the taxpayer dollar here.I want to see people at work in the United States.

Morgan Chase and company, was chosen to lead the newly created Trade Bank of Iraq. I thought it was going to be the United States was going to get some help. No, we have J.P. Morgan and 13 international banks, and they are going to put together something called the Trade Bank of Iraq.The coalition authority that I just referred to, the 25-member coalition authority which is now in charge of finance, according to the New York Times, in Iraq created the Trade Bank to allow Iraqi ministries to begin making ``big ticket purchases abroad.''This is all a corporate scam and the country has to wake up to the fact that we are utilizing our young men and women in harm's way in the military uniform of the United States to carry out the corporate interests of this administration, and that Iraq, if not before now, is a quicksand of corporate endeavor on behalf of profit-taking by corporations utilizing the all-volunteer force of the United States, and we have to take seriously whether or not we are going to allow it to continue.My view is, and I put it forward for consideration, that if we are going to deal with this situation straightforwardly, we have to talk about letting this 25-member authority take over. They say they are in charge of finance, they are in charge of security, they are in charge of trade, they are in charge of banking, in charge of oil, let them be in charge. Bring the American troops on out of there and let that Iraqi authority set the terms and conditions under which the United Nations will come in and help put this together.I am perfectly willing to vote funds because we caused this problem, funds that will enable the Iraqi people to get back on their feet, provided it is done in an international context at the behest of and request of the Iraqi authority which we supposedly have not only set up but now have in charge of these various ministries.",

I understand that. But the question here that I have raised here is what in fact is the role of the United States and these troops? How do we make it work? Let me put it this way, that is not an argument.In my dreams I keep thinking Thomas Edward Lawrence, where are you, come back. Lawrence, come back and tell us what it is we are forgetting.What do we think we can do when people made an argument back in World War I that the Arabs were not ready. This was a Western concept. This is people coming in from the outside telling somebody else that they were not ready. They were not ready to have the French divide up and the English divide up Iraq for their political purposes, but they were certainly ready to do whatever it was that they felt was necessary.I am sure that the colonial armies under George Washington were not ready. Cornwallis was wandering all over, wandering through Maryland and New Jersey, wandering through upstate New York; and back in England they said, We have got to get out. It does not matter whether they are ready or not. We are going to be adrift with our people being picked off one by one in the American Revolutionary War. We are facing the same kind of situation in terms of the material prospect for the military of the United States in Iraq today. It is not up to us to decide whether or not they are ready.Let me tell what one of the members of the governing council said yesterday. Abdel Aziz Hakim, the brother of Ayatollah Hakim who was killed in the car bomb, a member of the United States appointed governing council to which I have referred this evening told mourners, and I quote, and this is from The Washington Post of yesterday, ``The occupation force is primarily responsible for the pure blood that was spilled in holy Najaf, the blood of Hakim and the faithful group that was present near the mosque. Iraq must not remain occupied and the occupation must leave so we can build Iraq as God wants us to do.''My point is we are dealing with a situation in which we do not have the prerogative of decisionmaking other than what we do about ourselves and for ourselves. We cannot decide for others. If the argument was, and again I do not want to dispute that because we have Members on this floor who voted for the resolution, who did not vote for the resolution who had different ideas what that resolution meant or did not mean, that is not an issue. I have no intention of pointing fingers and extracting some kind of admissions about what might have been the true faith at the time.What I am saying is we now face a situation in which we have to make a determination whether our continued presence is a positive or negative force and what should constitute our continued presence.",

The toughest thing we have ever done since 9/11, which is coming up in a couple of days, the biggest sacrifice we ever made is not the inconvenience of taking off your shoes walking through a testing device at the airport, we postponed the Super Bowl for 1 week. That is the big sacrifice. We are supposedly in a total war. The President tells me that I am in a war, a total war, over maybe 10 years and we are going to go and we are going to conduct this war with every fiber that we have. We are not doing anything of the kind. We are watching the football game on television.When I see those guys out on the field, I see there is a kid from Ohio State, he cannot decide whether he wants to go to class or not. He does not know whether it is worth it. I do not blame him. They are marketing him over there. They are making a million dollars out of him. We are worried about whether some professional basketball player took advantage of a young woman and we are going to spend more money and time on that. They are all pretty healthy, it looks to me.

Why do we not have a draft if we really mean that this is a war against terror and this is something that we have to fight right through to the end with all the resources of the United States?That is what I cannot bear. I cannot bear the idea that we sit here, 435 of us that have been designated on the trust and faith of our constituents to try and make good judgments. We do not have a referendum in here in this country. This is not something where we just run out and take a vote on the fashion of the moment. We are supposed to be trying to use what brains that God gave us and what judgment we have been able to accrue over the experiences of our lifetime and, based on the faith and trust of our constituents, render responsible policies and obligations for this country. What I am saying is that these young men and women have volunteered for the armed services of the United States not because we expect them to throw their lives away on the political fashion of the moment, but because we expect to be able to provide them with the necessities of being able to carry through on the strategic interests of this Nation.I say that the strategic interests of this Nation now requires us to have an exit plan out of Iraq and to turn the question of Iraq and its governance over to the Iraqis as soon as possible so that they can make the necessary arrangements with the United Nations, of which we are a part, in order to aid and assist them.",

The exact quote, as a matter of fact, is that according to the Los Angeles Times, they said they would ``pressure other countries to come up with the additional funds needed to restore security in Iraq and repair its ravaged infrastructure.''

    "title": "RESTORING OPERATION OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN VETERAN HOUSING LOAN PROGRAM DURING FISCAL YEAR 2003 TO SCOPE IN EFFECT ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2002",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill to reinstate the Native American Veteran Housing Loan program.I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Mr. Smith, the Ranking Member, Mr. Evans, and the staff of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for their work in crafting this much-needed remedy to the present situation. I would also like to thank Senator Akaka for his leadership over the years on this issue. He and his staff have been tireless in their efforts to rectify this problem since it arose in May.In 1992, the Native American Veterans Home Loan Equity Act was enacted to establish and implement a pilot program to make direct housing loans to aid Native American (Indian, Alaska or Hawaii native, or Pacific Islander) veterans in purchasing, constructing, or improving, dwellings on trust land. Almost 11 years later, the VA has closed several hundred loans, and the program is a resounding success.Native Hawaiian veterans have greatly benefited from the loan program. Through the end of Fiscal Year 2002, 300 loans were closed throughout the Pacific. Of the 300 loans, about 215 were new construction loans, with the balance consisting of Interest Rate Reduction Loans. Although Hawaii has the highest loan volume, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam have significant levels of activity. About 100 of the 300 loans have been paid in full and the other 200 are active and performing. Only one loan termination has occurred to date since 1992.This year's dramatic increase in use of the program mirrors the national upswing in financing new construction and refinancing existing loans. Home ownership has long been a hallmark of financial growth and community stability, and it's encouraging to see so many vets in my own state enjoying this benefit. However, I deeply regret that more of our Native American veterans were unable to take advantage of the 40-year historic low financing rates available a mere two and a half months ago. The untimely halt to this past May cut off deserving veterans from this financial tool. Mr. Speaker, I hope that we can do better in the future to correct such problems before they cause inadvertent harm.In the end, this measure is about equity. The Native American Veterans Direct Loan program exists to afford our Native American, Native Hawaiian, Alaskan Native, and Pacific Islander veterans on trust lands the same benefits available to the rest of our veterans community. We need to sustain this program--it's a matter of fairness.I urge my colleagues to support this measure.Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",

That child's parents may or may not be paying the same kinds of taxes, contributing the same kind of financial support, that would be there if that parent was in fact living in that district as a matter of course in their life. So in areas where we have a high number of military dependents, the United States and Congress in its wisdom has evolved a system called Impact Aid.Now, the astounding thing that is taking place today is here are our constituents on behalf of military-dependent children appearing in our offices asking for funding, full funding of Impact Aid, inside the boundaries of the United States. We will pay foreign nations 100 cents on the dollar with respect to those children and their education, but within the boundaries of the United States, tonight as I speak, those children and their parents have to beg the United States Government for financial assistance for the children of our own military that are serving.Some of the same military that is serving tonight in Iraq have children in this country whose education is not being paid for by the Impact Aid to which they are entitled. This is the kind of disconnect that is taking place with the prosecution of this war and its aftermath that the people of this country have to come to grips with and come to terms with.",

These are the dependent children of people who are now fighting in Iraq, and those children and the school districts within which they are now living are not funded under the Impact Aid program that we ourselves have authorized in the Congress.If this is taken as the basis for our conversation in the immediate, I would point out that is one of the reasons why some of us are insisting that before any of this money be voted, that it be authorized; that the requisite subject matter committees, perhaps the Committee on Education and the Workforce or most certainly the Committee on Armed Services, have hearings on this to determine what in fact should be authorized, how much unexpended funds there are, where funds have been allocated, and have an audit of what has been spent to this point, what is expected to be spent, before we simply go to the Committee on Appropriations and in effect block the entire legislative process that has been established for every other item.The fact is that an appropriation, an emergency appropriation, a supplemental appropriation, should be handled only under emergency circumstances. These are not emergency circumstances. This is the result of what has taken place up to this point and needs a sober, serious consideration and analysis before we take one step forward.",

But the fact that it has to be passed, the fact that the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) has to take the lead as the appropriations chair to right this wrong is indicative of the fact that the administration has failed to understand what is at stake here. Surely something like this could be rescinded by an Executive Order. We are apparently able to go to war without the slightest recourse to the Congress for approval; one would think that the administration could rescind this tax on food for wounded veterans in our Nation's military hospitals.So I think the Congress has the obligation to get involved in this oversight in a way beyond that which is the ordinary passage of bills and the ordinary scope of legislation that we go through in the quotidian details of legislative life here in Washington. This is a perfect example of it. In some respects, it is almost shameful that the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations has to resort to a legislative bill to right this wrong, which is obvious to anyone who would objectively look at the situation.There is no doubt in my mind that the good offices of the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations is utterly and totally sincere and straightforward. The question is not the motivation of a Republican Member or a Democratic Member; it is that the Congress has to bring any administration, Democrat or Republican, to account with respect to how we fund things, where we fund things, why we fund things, and what the rationale is behind it.

    "text": "Madam Speaker, what we have attempted to do over these weeks is to bring the hammer of truth down on the anvil of inquiry, and that is the object of these discussions. People have sometimes asked me, and I know they have asked other Members, why is it that we have these sessions late at night during what is called Special Orders. And because we are used to it, we may take it for granted that everyone knows what that is. The people who may be perusing through the various channels on their television set may come upon C-SPAN, and they see the regular order of business is concluded for the day, and now we are in Special Orders.What that means is in this people's House, membership of which is restricted, restricted to those who have been elected, not appointed, elected by their constituents across this country, the faith and trust of their constituents have put all of us on this floor.We are here under Special Orders because this is our opportunity to speak to our colleagues and to the Nation about those matters which we consider most important and which we may not have had the opportunity during the regular course of business to discuss at length or in-depth. Unfortunately, as I have mentioned over and over again, we are dependent on the people of this country, on the people of our Nation, to pay attention to what may be said here, not because we necessarily know more than others, but because we have been privileged to occupy these positions and accept this responsibility and meet the obligations of carrying forward an inquiry for the Nation at large, so that we can determine what the best course of action is. Over and over, we reach out to the country here on this most important of issues, our Iraq Watch, because the media, and you see my arm reaching back to those who cannot see it, the galleries are here for a free press to join us, to observe us and they are never here. They are never here because they are occupied with those matters which they consider most important. They are chasing after a circus out in California, they are trying to determine whether or not they can start a fight, a verbal fight, some verbal fisticuffs between politicians, they are preoccupied with process and politics is entertainment. But that is not what our charge is, and that is why we are here at 11 o'clock at night on the east coast, not because we have nothing else to do in terms of our responsibilities and our commitment, but meeting our most important responsibility, which is to reach out to the citizens of this country to let them know that their Members here in the People's House are focusing in on those items not just of interest, but of most immediate concern to their welfare and to the welfare of peace throughout the world. And so we meet here tonight, and we meet here every week, determined to bring forward from our inquiry not just a measure of truth, but hopefully a sense of insight and to bring forward the facts, as best we know them, to let people draw their judgments.And so the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) has here this evening a chart. Maybe we cannot all see it on the television screen, so he is going to explicate for us what is on that chart, and what it means. The reason that we are doing it is because we have a deep and abiding desire to share with the entire citizenry of the country our profound concern that we are moving in the wrong direction. The fact is that there is no higher degree of patriotism, especially when you think your country is moving in the wrong direction and the price of that moving in the wrong direction is the blood and grievous wounding of our young people. We have to speak out under those circumstances, and that is why we are here this evening. I am particularly pleased to be joined as the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) indicated by his colleague, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Meehan), and a former president of the Connecticut State Senate and now the ranking member, the senior Democrat on our Committee on House Administration, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson), joining with us tonight. They are here, I think, at this stage to back up the issue, the issue at hand which is can we put forward a policy and analyze the circumstances under which these policies are presently being put forward by the administration, can we put forward an analysis and analyze these policies in such a manner as to give some direction that will see that this comes to an early end?",

That is how Harry Truman made his reputation. And when he was President of the United States, the Marshall Plan was free of that kind of corruption, free of that kind of cronyism, free of that kind of direction.I have a suggestion for the gentleman from Oregon: We now have Ms. Rice in charge of stabilization. I am not quite sure what she knows about construction. She constructs sentences very well. By the time she gets finished, a house of cards is still standing. I do not know how long that house of cards is going to stand, but she does her best to construct it.Now, perhaps she can do the same for reconstruction in Iraq. I do not know. But if she is in charge of that, presumably she will be in charge of the $600 million that is going to be borrowed and spent to find the nonexistent weapons of mass destruction.Perhaps some of the folks in the gentleman's district or State that are out of work can apply for a job over there. Not that they could do real work in Oregon on roads and bridges and schools, something of substance, but they can chase their shadows over in Iraq looking for nonexistent weapons of mass destruction for $600 million.",

It is not as if these guys were eager volunteers. Then I said we can pay them if there are going to be any payments made. Let us let them do the rebuilding of Iraq. Let them set the standard for it. Let Iraqis do the rebuilding. Of course we can assist them. That way we can get them on our side and not cause a huge fissure in Iraqi society; and, of course, that suggestion was ignored.I just want it on the record that the administration knew full well that there were Members who had reservations about the war but who, of course, wanted to have the best possible outcome once the attack was over, who made a suggestion that it was very, very important not to dismember Iraqi society in order to accommodate profiteering on the part of companies in the United States.",

The only thing that is stable, the only thing that is growing, the only thing that is expanding, the only thing that is a sure thing in Afghanistan is there is more heroin being traded for more money that is going to find its way into the pockets of those who are financing terrorism.",

    "text": "The parallel, and I am not one to draw analogies to Vietnam because I think most of those kinds of comparisons tend to be inexact and then you end up in useless kinds of arguments as to exactitude, but the parallels are there. You may recall the rather infamous phrase associated with our pacification policy in Vietnam. We had to destroy the village in order to save it. Now in order to stabilize Iraq, we have to take barbed wire and surround whole villages with it. So I think the question here is, at this stage, what is to be done? How are we to regard the war on terror and what the relationship of the attack on Baghdad and the subsequent war which followed it, how is that to be handled? How is that to be addressed by the United States?We are told, and again these cliches and bromides come fast and furious, that we should not cut and run. I am going to have to presume, I guess, that I know what cutting and running means. It means that you stop doing what you are doing and you leave. I do not know whether anybody noticed it or not, I certainly noticed, about November 15, that is precisely what Mr. Bush and Mr. Bremer concluded, that the United States was going to cut and run. That is what we are doing right now. The problem is that we are not admitting that that is what we are doing and we are sacrificing the Reserves and the Guard and the active duty military that is there now and that which will be going there to this continued failed policy without admitting what we are doing.We are turning over supposedly conveniently, just before the election in 2004, turning over, supposedly, the present occupation to a government in Iraq. If that is not cutting and running, I do not know what is. Are we going to turn over control, such as it might be, to some governing entity in Iraq, or are we not? And if we are, what constitutes that governing entity, this farce of an advisory group that we have there? Shiite clerics? The ill-equipped and untrained police forces that we have cobbled together? Or perhaps we are going to turn it over to this new paramilitary army made up of armed members of various political parties in Iraq. A paramilitary force.And we have the gall to turn to the American people and say, ``Well, they are preparing to defend themselves.'' They are preparing to cut each other's throats. They are preparing to fight one another, not just politically but with guns and bullets. The fact of the matter is that there is utter and complete political chaos in Iraq that is not being addressed by existing military policy of the United States.",

There is a bill going forward that hopefully will be signed on a bipartisan basis to increase the end strength of the armed services, the Army and Marines in particular, and I am afraid now we are going to have to include the Air Force. At one point I think if we had handled this, we would not have had to add the Air Force. Since 1995, I for one and others on the Committee on Armed Services and other interested parties have been urging, so this goes beyond the present administration.We are not trying to draw distinctions there. Since 1995, some of us have been urging an increase in the end strength. That is an inside baseball term in the Committee on Armed Services for increasing the number of troops in the Army and in the Marine Corps, because we could see the kinds of deployments that were taking place, whether it was in Kosovo, whether it was in Bosnia, in other words, in Eastern Europe, whether it was in the Philippines. No matter where it was and no matter what the reasons may have been, no matter how one felt about it one way or the other, the plain fact of the matter is that there was sufficient support to warrant these deployments, and we did not have the troop strength available to do it. We do not yet have a reinstitution of the draft.When people talk about the war on terrorism, most people are watching it on television. We are depending on a volunteer force to do that. What sacrifices have we made? Some inconvenience in an airport? Somebody running, as they did for me yesterday when I flew here, running their wands over your shoes? Having you hold your arms out so that they can check your watch? Examining your baggage? What kind of sacrifice is that? At most it is an inconvenience.The only sacrifice that we have made as a population since 9/11 is we postponed the Super Bowl one week. An inconvenience. That is the only sacrifice that has been made. This is being watched on television. This is being observed. We get the little tear in the eye and we get the flag being waved around those who are in Walter Reed or in Bethesda Hospital right now with grievous wounds. The sacrifice of the troops is not the point here. It is the sacrifice of those troops on a battlefield of corrupt political policy unworthy of the troops that are out there. And I tell you this, we cannot sustain with the existing Guard and Reserves that we have in this country the continual deployment into Iraq and still meet the necessities that we have outlined with respect to Afghanistan. That does not even begin to include questions about North Korea or any other place that United States troops may or may not be needed in the future as a result of some activity, other kinds of terrorist activity in other places around the world. We are not prepared. We are not able to engage in deployments with respect to terror in the rest of the world because of the failure of our policies in Iraq and our failure to understand the true nature of what was necessary in Afghanistan.",

I delighted to see you today.Mr. Chairman, as the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Force, I have the distinct pleasure of working with my good friend, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon). I do not believe I see him on the floor at the moment. I see other good friends from the committee.I wanted to express my personal appreciation to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon). His impressive familiarity with the details of the numerous programs under our subcommittee purview is one of the major reasons we are considering a defense authorization that correctly addresses the hardware needs of the military.Our subcommittee held many in-depth, rigorous oversight hearings on a variety of programs, and I think our adherence to a sound process in this arena has served our committee, the Congress, and the Department of Defense very well.While we dealt with significant programs in all services, this bill explicitly recognizes the importance of a strong Army. The Army has had an uphill fight inside the Pentagon the last few years, and I think the recent war showed how capable they really are.I am especially pleased that our bill does no harm to the future Stryker Brigades and that the committee was able to come to an agreement about fencing off funding for the remaining brigades. We have struck a blow in a couple of cases for better program management. I am glad to see that the F-22 cut its cost. We fenced further money until its software works the way as it is promised.The Army's future combat system may be a good thing. It is hard to tell because its budget structure makes it hard to evaluate. We changed that structure so that everybody can see whether the future combat system will work.We are working on some very advanced systems in all the services. I believe we have struck the right balance between future forces and our legacy systems. In funding modernization of our heavy forces, this bill ensures that we do not sacrifice the real combat capability today for the promise of capability in the future.I would like to conclude and I would be remiss, Mr. Chairman, if I did not acknowledge the hard work and long hours put in by our committee staff on all levels.Mr. Chairman, I would like to close by again thanking the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) and all the members of the various subcommittee with whom I have had the pleasure of working on this bill.",

What I am doing now for those who are listening and have an interest, it now is on my Web site. The Iraq Watch in its entirety appears.So we have a kind of cyber-archive now of what we are doing with Iraq Watch. And it will be interesting, I think, in time to come to go back over it and see where we were, where we were going. Not because we are standing here on the sidelines, merely commenting as we go along, but rather we are trying to stimulate debate, trying to stimulate discussion, trying to stimulate the body politic through the means available to us here in the House.We are the people's house. For those who just may be tuning in now, going down the cable channels and seeing C-SPAN, what are they talking about tonight, we are talking about our sons and daughters. We are talking about the blood and treasure of the United States. We are talking about the basic values of this country. We are talking about whether we are falling into the trap of a neo-imperialism, a 21st-century version of imperialism that would be anathema to values of the United States, the United States as we have known it and as we have wanted it to be.And in that context, I would like to read an excerpt from David Fromkin's new book called: A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East.'' Again, for those who, and I will repeat it at the end of my excerpt as well, David Fromkin's ``A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of a Modern Middle East.''And I am quoting:``Churchill, when he took office as Colonial Secretary [1921], brought with him a broad strategic concept of how to hold down the Middle East inexpensively. While he was still Secretary of Air and War [1919-20], Churchill had proposed to cut Middle East costs by governing Mesopotamia,'' which essentially is modern-day Iraq, ``by means of airplanes and armored cars. A few well-protected air bases,'' he wrote at the time, ``would enable the Royal Air Force to operate in every part of the protectorate and to enforce control now here, now there, without the need of maintaining long lines of communication, eating up troops and money.``Viewing imperialism as a costly drain on a society that needed to invest all of its remaining resources in rebuilding itself, the bulk of the British press, public, and Parliament agreed to let the government commit itself to a presence in the Arab Middle East only because Winston Churchill's ingenious strategy made it seem possible to control the region inexpensively.``Thus the belief, widely shared by British officials during and after the First World War, that Britain had come to the Middle East to stay at least long enough to reshape the region in line with European political interests, ideas, and ideals, was based on the fragile assumption that Churchill's aircraft-and-armored-car strategy could hold local opposition at bay indefinitely. In turn, that assumption was another expression of the underestimation of the Middle East that had typified British policy all along. It had shown itself when [Foreign Secretary Edward] Grey disdained the offer of an Ottoman alliance in 1911; when [Prime Minister Herbert] Asquith in 1914 regarded Ottoman entry in the war as being of no great concern; and when [War Minister Horatio] Kitchener, in 1915, sent his armies to their doom against an entrenched and forewarned foe at Gallipoli in an attack the British Government knew would be suicidal if the defending troops were of European quality, Kitchener's fatal assumption being that they were not.``In 1922 the British Government had arrived at a political compromise with British society, by the terms of which Britain could assert her mastery in the Middle East, so long as she could do so at little cost. To British officials who underestimated the difficulties Britain would encounter in governing the region, who indeed had no conception of the magnitude of what they had undertaken, that meant Britain was in the Middle East to stay. In retrospect, however, it was an early indication that Britain was likely to leave,'' unquote, from David Fromkin's ``A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottomon Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East.''",

Hundreds of people are dead, thousands of people have been grievously wounded.Speaking of the prestige that the gentleman referred to, that has been literally destroyed the world over. We now have the Secretary, the spectacle, the spectacle of the Secretary of the State now wondering whether or not he would have made the same recommendations had he had other information, at the same time when many of us here were saying, let us take a deep breath, let us be sure we know what we are doing. The inspections are working; the inspections were underway.We were not getting the information back that the administration wanted to hear. That is the difficulty. My memory is not in such difficult straits that I cannot recall what happened during those times. I realize we are now at a point that would understand only too well where inconvenient thought is shoved down the memory hole. We simply put it out of sight and pretend it did not happen. The plain fact of the matter is that there were cries all across this country, an outcry all across the country saying that the inspection process has not yet completed its task. We need to do that at a minimum before we go to war.It is one thing for people to talk about supporting the troops. It is one thing to talk about whether the definition of imminent is the same for everybody across the spectrum, but you cannot say that a political policy which has failed to do the minimum necessary before there is a commitment to war is something that needs to be defended in the name of defending the troops.Mr. McClellan or the President, neither Mr. McClellan speaking for the President nor Mr. Bush can get off that easy, nor can they claim that this is a situation that needs now to be explored in the aftermath of this tragedy.I submit that we are now in a situation that needs further explanation. My understanding now is that we have announced that we are going to be leaving on the 30th of June of this year. We are now in February. March, April, June. We are talking about in 100 days we are ostensibly going to turn over authority to somebody or something in Iraq. Is there anybody here who can tell me who is going to have authority, what institutional framework or structure is going to exercise that authority? I cannot find out who it is.Is it going to be United Nations inspectors? No, they have been told they were inadequate. Is it going to be United Nations observers or administrators in some form? They left. I understand that the United States now in some fashion is in discussions with them as to whether they will come back in. To do what? With whom?It is very interesting, one need only go to this issue of the New York Times Magazine for February 1, this past Sunday, and this article on what the Shiites really want. A quote from a U.S. official, ``We can fight the Suunis, but we cannot fight the Shiites, not if they organize against us. There are too many of them.''Is that what we have been reduced to? Is that what the policies are involved here? If you want to talk about imminent danger, how about the imminent danger of people demanding direct elections so that they can conduct their own affairs.This is the situation that we find ourselves in today. This is the situation that we have to confront. This is a situation that will not allow us to continue to merely stand on the side and observe the President trying to get the facts. He should have had the facts before he committed us into war. And he should get the facts now on what it takes in order for us to be able to exert such influence as we can in a positive way now that we have entered into this imperialist dream of imposing our authority on Iraq in the wake of Saddam Hussein's capture.",

I will tell you how a con succeeds. A con succeeds not because of the special insight of the one perpetrating the con. The person who does that, the con man, is not depending even on his own skill. He is depending on the desire of the other person to have the conclusion that they want to have come out. It is preordained they want the con. You cannot succeed with a con unless the other person is playing into it with you. They think they are getting something for nothing, or they think that something they want very much to be real is actually going to happen. You are going to win; you are going to succeed; you are going to be able to work the angle; you are going to be able to get something that somebody else does not have.All you have to do is look at the record of the desire of the advisers to Mr. Bush and their determination to reenter the Middle East along the same lines as I read from the Churchill imperial era, and to come back into with their version in the 21st century, they want those weapons to be there. They wanted to take any scrap of information that came in and turn it into proof positive that what they wanted to do and the policies they wanted to follow of going in there and having a war with Iraq was something that was substantiated by the information that they were getting. It did not matter that it may have gone the other way. It did not matter it was ambiguous, tenuous, or that it was fragments.What mattered was, is something was being said about it, and they were bound and determined to turn that into information which could be construed as being supportive of having to go to war. No matter what happened, they were going go to war.I find it very, very instructive that the Secretary of the Treasury's book that has just come out has been denounced along with him. He apparently has turned into an apostate, too, in the process simply by saying that these impressions and his honest impression as related in his book was that from the moment he entered service to the Bush administration, that they were determined to go to war; that no matter what happened they were going to go to war.So as we take a look at this and see what happened in the past, that, it seems to me, is prelude to the future. And so I suggest for our upcoming Iraq Watches that we take up the question, then, of what is going to happen on June 30; who are we going to be dealing with; what are the circumstances under which authority is to be turned over in Iraq by the United States; is this going to be yet another election ploy? Because the Bush administration is trying to use support for troops being synonymous with support for the war for election year purposes now, and I am very anxious to find out whether this transfer of authority is also going to be used for election purposes or are we going to actually be able to do something that will advance democracy in Iraq. I think we need to concentrate on that.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I have never seen a picture or any film of Mr. Chalabi when he was not smiling and when he did not have the smuggest look on his face and when he did not have the demeanor of someone who had pulled off a coup, when he did not have a patronizing attitude towards those doing the interview. I can understand why. He has played us for saps and suckers, and the result is we have dead and wounded, grievously wounded. The result is the sacking of the Treasury of the United States, and the result is that we have had people whose ideological bent in the administration was such that they wanted to go to war using each other, Chalabi using them, them using Chalabi, in the most cynical fashion, the result of which we now see before us.He said, and I remind Members and those listening to us, what was said before is not important. That which became the justification for what we did is not important. He got what he wanted. Those who wanted to have war with Iraq got what they wanted. They are not paying the price. They are not the ones who have to suffer for the rest of their lives either by having grievous wounds or by having the irretrievable loss of someone that they love as a result of this.The question for us and the question that we have to ask not just ourselves but the American people are going to have to ask, is, is this going to be allowed? Is this going to be something that we are going to pass off? The fact that the Newsweek cover that the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) referred to in his remarks just previously could have a headline, ``How Dick Cheney Sold the War,'' the crass indifference of a headline like that in terms of its implications, as if you sell a war, not that you are driven into it, not that necessity forced you to come to that sorry and reluctant conclusion, but rather how you sold the war.Nothing, I think, could be a commentary more persuasive to me of how this has been manipulated, how this has been maneuvered in a way that discredits this administration, discredits Mr. Cheney in that role. He has yet to come to grips with it, and the White House and the administration as a whole has yet to come to grips with it, because if my information is correct and the information given to The Washington Post is correct, and this is something that one would have the opportunity to see whether it is correct unless it has changed since its publication on February 22 was that the Web site for the White House, the White House official Web site cites the same false information today. It has not changed since March. I quote from the Web site of the White House as of February 22: ``The United Nations and U.S. intelligence sources have known for some time that Saddam Hussein has materials to produce chemical and biological weapons, but has not accounted for them: 26,000 liters of anthrax, enough to kill several million people; 38,000 liters of botulism toxin; 500 tons of sarin mustard and VX nerve agents; and 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents.'' And finally: ``He recently sought significant quantities of uranium in Africa, according to the British Government.''These are the same lies and the same fabrications, the same prevarications, the same falsehoods, the same misleading directions that took us into this war and continue to be repeated in the face of the knowledge that we know them not to be true.How could it be that these continue to be repeated? Is it any wonder that Mr. Chalabi laughs at us? Is it any wonder that he adopts a smug disposition when we continue to support him, we continue to pay him, we continue to support the policies that he espoused, and he is able to say what was said before is not important because obviously there are no penalties attached to it?",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I will ask to have the article that the gentleman from Pennsylvania is referring to entered into the Record as part of our deliberation.Several well-heeled Iraqis who hope to play central roles in Iraq's emerging government have launched lobbying campaigns in Washington to influence the Bush administration and Congress as they work to shape a permanent government in Iraq. The group of Iraqis, which include three members of the U.S.-created Iraqi Governing Council, are spending as much as $100,000 per month on lobbying firms and public relations agents to press U.S. officials to create a modern, democratic government that is not dominated by Islamic conservatives. ``It's like they are running for president,'' said one U.S. official of the competing public relations efforts in Washington. The three Iraqis began their public relations efforts in Washington more than a decade after another Iraqi member of the Iraqi Governing Council--Ahmed Chalabi--began cultivating close ties to now-Vice President Cheney and other key administration officials. According to forms filed with the Justice Department, Ayad Allawi, a member and former president of the Iraqi Governing Council, has begun an expensive lobbying and public relations effort to press U.S. officials to build a modern democratic government that builds on Iraq's existing foundations. Allawi has already paid more than $300,000 to Washington from Preston Gates Ellis &amp; Rouvelas Meeds LLP to help open doors on Capital Hill and at the White House. Allawi also hired a former U.S. ambassador to coordinate his Washington effort and a New York advertising firm that once worked for the Beatles to manage his image in the United States. The public relations effort, which could top $1 million this year, is funded by Mashal Nawab, an Iraqi-born physician who is a ``close friend and admirer'' of Allawi, according to the Justice Department forms. Adnan Pachachi, another member and former president of Iraq's interim government, has also signed up a Washington public relations firm to help him get his message across to the Bush administration and Congress. F. Wallace Hayes, working on a pro bono basis for now, will write press releases for the 70-year-old Pachachi that ``promote democracy in Iraq,'' according to the Justice Department forms. Meanwhile, Baqir Jabor, an Iraqi exile appointed by the United States to run Iraq's housing and construction department, has asked former Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.) and his influential Washington lobbying firm to help arrange a series of meetings with the Bush administration during his upcoming visit to the United States. Officials at Livingston Group said Jabor is not a formal client of the firm. Other details of Livingston's work with Jabor are not yet available because Jabor first asked Livingston for help only last month. The new public relations campaigns in Washington come as the Bush administration struggles to complete an interim constitution for Iraq by the end of the month in order to turn control of the government over to Iraq this year. In the past few days, it has become clear that the United States will fail to meet both deadlines. Over the weekend, the Kurds in northern Iraq--which comprise 20 percent of the country--rejected key parts of the constitution. Meanwhile, Paul Bremer, the U.S. administrator in Iraq, acknowledged last week that it is unlikely that Iraq will be able to hold an election for at least another year. By hiring lobbyists in Washington, the Iraqi leaders hope to one day play a central role in the emerging government. The Iraqis who have hired lobbyists are each former exiles who want the United States to create a democratically elected government. Iraq's Shiites make up as much as 60 percent of the country and are better organized than their political and ethnic rivals, the Kurds and the Sunnis. The leader of Iraq's Shiite conservatives, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, hopes to schedule quick elections, knowing that he and his allies would dominate the government if elections are held soon. Allawi, Jabor and Pachachi share another rival in Chalabi. But unlike the Iraqi newcomers to Washington, Chalabi has worked for years in Washington cultivating friendships with key players like Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle. Since 1986, Shea &amp; Gardner has represented Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress in Washington for about $10,000 a month. One of the partners at Shea &amp; Gardner is James Woolsey, the former CIA director. Chalabi also gets help from Francis Brooke, a political consultant, and Riva Levinson of BKSH &amp; Associates, the Washington firm founded by Charles Black, a long-time ally of President Bush. Those contacts have paid off: At this year's State of the Union address, Chalabi sat in the VIP box with first lady Laura Bush. Chalabi also was one of the few Iraqis permitted to meet face to face with Saddam Hussein in his cell in the hours after his capture in late December. Chalabi has long been considered the favorite of Defense Department officials to lead Iraq's new government. However, his star appears to be fading as Pentagon officials question some of the military intelligence he provided before the war and as Iraqis increasingly view Chalabi as a pawn for the United States. Meanwhile, the State Department is thought to favor Pachachi, while the CIA backs Allawi. His main opponent in Washington is thought to be Chalabi, a distant relative. Though Chalabi and Allawi both oppose an Iraqi government run by Islamics, they split over the structure of a new secular government. Chalabi would like to rid the country of anything to do with Hussein's Baath Party, while Chalabi--a member of the Baath Party before it was hijacked by Hussein in the 1970s-- believes the new government should be built upon the existing foundations. ``There are options available to make use of the civil structures that are available in Iraq rather than throwing everything out,'' said R. Paul Stimers of Allawi's lobbying firm, Preston Gates. Allawi, a neuroscientist by training, survived a vicious assassination attempt in the late 1970s when Hussein allies tried to axe him to death in his sleep. He later became a source of important--and sometimes suspect--intelligence information to the CIA. After the war, he was appointed to the interim Iraqi Governing Council and tapped to take charge of security for the country. In Washington, Allawia and his British benefactor last fall hired Patrick Theros, a former U.S. ambassador to Qatar, to build his base of support among key Members of Congress and the Bush administration. Theros runs a consulting firm, Theros &amp; Theros, with his wife and son out of their home in a leafy section of Northwest Washington. With a total monthly budget that began at $122,000, Allawi brought on New York public relations agency Brown Lloyd James Ltd.--a firm that once represented the Beatles--for $12,500 a month. For lobbying work, Allawi tapped Washington lobbying shop Preston Gates for $100,000 a month, though the firm has since lowered its monthly retainer to less than $50,000. According to contracts filed with the Justice Department, the firms will help Allawi ``gain U.S. government support for his policy suggestions for Iraq'' by ``explain[ing] his views on the security and political situation in Iraq.'' Theros, who is making about $10,000 a month from Allawi, plans to attend ``public forums, seminars, events and meetings which represent an opportunity'' to express Allawi's ideas. Allawi's lobbying effort was expected to end this spring when the United States was expected to hand control over the government to Iraq. But with the prospects of meeting that deadline dim, the lobbying and public relations campaign is expected to continue.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts. Again, Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman indicated, this is Iraq Watch. Several Members, some of whom voted for the resolution with respect to the attack in Iraq and some who did not, have been participating. The reason being that we find ourselves in a situation today where we are arguing about such things as budget, arguments taking place right now, both in the Republican Conference and in the Democratic Caucus. We find ourselves coming up on what might be termed the anniversary of the Iraq invasion. It is the anniversary. The question is before us as to what has been accomplished, what was involved; and I think, Mr. Speaker, I want to set a perspective before my colleagues and hopefully those in the American public who are viewing this evening.There has been an increase, both in terms of discussion and in terms of reporting about activity on the Pakistan-Afghani border. There is speculation in the press, speculation in our communities across this country as to the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden and his cohorts; a flurry of reporting taking place that there is increased activity, sensors being placed, special forces being brought together, strike forces, including Pakistani troops, American troops, CIA operatives. The question becomes this, Mr. Speaker: Why now? Why has this not been going on since September 11, 2001? Why is it taking place 6, 8 months before an election? Where is the justification for what took place in Iraq as a diversion from going forward on the Afghan-Pakistan border to capture or eliminate Osama bin Laden and his cohorts? What is the justification as we come up on the year anniversary of the invasion of Iraq of not bringing hostilities to a conclusion in Afghanistan and Pakistan with respect to the attack that was made on the United States?There is a cover here that the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) has to his immediate right from Time Magazine, with a picture of Mr. Bush facing himself, a mirror image, if you will, that says, believe it or not, Does Bush have a credibility gap? I cite that not because I am interested in what Time Magazine has to say by way of cute phrasing or what they consider to be a provocative title or visual, but, rather, that the question is one that needs to be answered as we approach this anniversary of the attack on Iraq. Why are we involved now in expedited activity and an expedited increase in intense activity on the Afghan-Pakistan border to capture or eliminate Osama bin Laden? What have we been doing for the past 2 years?Well, I can tell my colleagues what we were doing. We were diverting our attention from those who attacked us on September 11 and instead preparing ourselves and ultimately carrying through an attack on Iraq, which has turned into a disaster, an unmitigated disaster for this country. We have not captured Osama bin Laden, we have not stopped or eliminated the Taliban threat in Afghanistan, we have not come to a conclusion with respect to the stability of Pakistan, and we have created a situation in Iraq which is headed for political, economic, and social disaster. Mr. DELAHUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. I would concur with the gentleman's analysis. He is absolutely correct. We secured a military victory in Afghanistan against those, the Taliban, that allowed, on their territory, in Afghanistan, the training and a safe haven for the real enemy of the United States, the al Qaeda terrorist network. It has been more than 2 years, more than 2 years since we secured that victory. And as the gentleman mentioned, we were distracted, if you will. We were distracted by an ideological conclusion that the defeat of Saddam Hussein would create a new democracy in the Middle East.Would that it be so. But as my colleague has mentioned, not only has Osama bin Laden not been captured, and I have a sense he will be captured, and the sooner the better, and if he is not captured, may he be killed because he is the enemy of the United States, I think it is important, however, given the distraction, if you will, based on a rationale that was put forth by this President, President Bush, that Saddam Hussein not only was in the possession and had a stockpile of weapons of mass destruction, and it was suggested, if you remember, that the threat of Saddam Hussein's possession of a nuclear weapon was very real, was very real, according to what the administration was saying, in that Saddam Hussein somehow had this murky relationship with these terrorists who had designs directly on the United States, that this information has turned out to be utterly without substance.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I wish that I had a bit more faith in the idea that there would be a positive response to the questions the gentleman is posing and the observations that he is making.The difficulty is we operate in a parallel universe. The Secretary of Defense is going to filter everything through the medium of his own perceptions, his own self-delusions. We are not going to see this. This is going to have to be resolved in the political world in the United States.Let me offer this example of the parallel universe that I am speaking of. In the March 15 Time magazine, an interview has been conducted with the administrator, Mr. Paul Bremer. Asked, to ``whom exactly are you handing over sovereignty'' in Iraq? Bremer said, ``The spaces are not filled in. We will hand over to a sovereign Iraq government on June 30. The shape and structure of that government is not yet defined. When we get finished with the transitional administrative law, we will turn to a broad dialogue with Iraqi politicians, provincial governors, local councils, ministers, a variety of people to try to figure out the best and most effective way to bring in the government. We do not know what that is yet.'' I submit that is such a startling statement of complete incapacity to understand what it is that is taking place. That is why I say we are living in a parallel universe. How is it possible for the American people to have any confidence when they are sending men and women of the armed services to Iraq, putting them in harm's way as a result of policies of this administration? How is it possible for us to expect anything else but the killing and grievous wounding of those military personnel in such an atmosphere, in which the administrator on behalf of the government of the United States is saying, ``When we get finished with the transitional administrative law, we will turn to a broad dialogue, a variety of people, to try to figure out the best and most effective way to bring in the government. We do not know who that is yet.''The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) was not at hearings in the Committee on Armed Services that I attended. I asked the same question within recent weeks, Exactly what is it that we are doing? Who are we turning this government over to? What is the authority? And what is the obligation that we have and our troops have? What authority does this governing entity that we are turning over to have? What authority does it have? What obligations does it have? Do we have a status of forces agreement? And with whom do we have a status of forces agreement? And whom will enforce the status of forces agreement?We are coming up on June 30, and yet the press having asked these questions, at least Time magazine having asked the question, prints it as if that answer was good and sufficient unto the question. We are about to engage in a situation in which we are going to have a farce take place of a presumed turning over of authority with a president, will he stand up, I do not know if he will get on a carrier, but will he stand up somewhere on a field in Iraq and say, Mission accomplished too, because this government has now come into being?I know what a government is. I think I know what the obligations and responsibilities of a government are, but I have yet to have a straightforward, clear-cut answer as to what the relationship of the United States military, let alone the United States Government, is going to have with this new governing entity on June 30.",

We will get accountability, and that accountability will be taking place. There is both the request for it and the demand for it. And, in fact, we will have an accounting and that accounting will be taking place in November. That is how we settle things in this country.Not the way things are going to be settled in Iraq, I am sorry to say. Here is a headline from the Monday Washington Post: ``The Iraq council signs interim constitution. Powerful Shiite cleric criticizes new law.''Without going into all the details of the signing of this document by a hand-picked group of people by the United States of America, the observation made in the course of a discussion of what the Shiite council members would seek by way of amendment or an addendum to the interim constitution when that government assumes its sovereignty on June 30, quoting from the article in The Washington Post, ``Although the U.S.-led occupation's authority is set to transfer political power that day, i.e. June 30, it is likely to maintain a military presence in Iraq for years to come.''That is what we have to face. This is a question of deliberate policy. This is a question of judgment. And the judgment that is made by the American people in the voting booth is their sentence, is what they pass on that judgment. This is the conclusion that they come to.Our obligation, it seems to me, here in the House of Representatives, in the time allotted to us and in the arena given to us by these special orders, is to try to lay before the American people what the consequences are of these policies, these judgments that were made, and the consequences of the action taken as a result of those judgments.Mr. Speaker, the sad part about it for me is that the vehicle we have for this, once you are outside of the political arena per se, is journalism, is the various media, electronic, written and otherwise. They are the ones that are falling down. They are the ones not asking the hard questions and allowing this kind of situation to develop without any kind of adequate inquiry. So it remains for us to do it here.We have to have an understanding here that what is taking place in Iraq today is the direct result of decisions taken based on judgments made and responsibility that has to be taken for those judgments. The fact that no one has been fired, the fact that no one has been brought to account is something that should not be a shock to anyone. Nobody is going to take responsibility for this unless the American people demand it in the voting booth.",

Then you are going to understand what true isolation is, where you are bereft of any capacity to pay your bills, to meet your obligations, to know that you will have healthcare, to be able to take care of your elderly parents, to have some semblance of dignity.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) would yield, one can only have that kind of a dialogue if we can entertain a legitimate political discussion on the issue. When those who are trying to bring these facts forward, those who have this perspective are enunciating it, are in turn denounced for failing to support our troops, denounced for failing to want to carry forward the war on terrorism, as it is always referred to, are denounced for presumably being unwilling to face up to the cold hard realities of what constitutes terrorism and its origins, then it is very difficult to do as the gentleman suggests.I had the experience of having the Governor of my State of Hawaii taken to Iraq for purposes that are beyond my ability to understand, other than when she came back she announced that President Bush's Iraq policy should not be the subject of political discussion, that we should not politicize the war.Now, that suggestion is as problematic, I suggest to the gentlemen in turn, as it is unrealistic. Foreign policy and defense policy are always legitimate topics for political debate. That is how we do things in a democracy. Unfortunately, today we had a resolution ostensibly addressing these issues 1 year after the invasion of, or the attack on, Baghdad, as I term it, after which a war started. The voting public has every right to a full and open airing of different points of view.We did not get to do that today. We were unable to attempt to amend the resolution dealing with these issues. It is most particularly pertinent, I think, when we are dealing with the lives of our servicemembers and the Treasury of our Nation. The resolution that ostensibly addressed these issues today very firmly supported by the Vice President, as you mentioned who, by the way, in my judgment is the most sinister Vice President we have ever had since Aaron Burr, this resolution tells us that the Iraq policies are out of bounds for discussion. We were not permitted to make amendments or to attempt to pass amendments with regard to this resolution. The document simply amplified the administration's viewpoint, an election-year endorsement of this policy. It will no doubt be denied and is being denied even now, I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that this has anything to do with politics. In fact, it is blatantly political; it is transparently political. It is in-your-face political.Our troops deserve better than this cursory salute swaddled in suffocating layers of political celebration. Our troops have earned our gratitude for their patriotism, their courage, and their spirit of sacrifice, something particularly missing from this debate today.More to the point, they deserve a solid commitment for their well-being and the well-being of their families. This is something that the majority today refused to do and has refused to do.Last week in the budget committee, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Edwards) and others proposed some simple measures along these lines. I want to recite them to you: Tri-care medical service for reservists, a boost in the imminent-danger pay, improved military housing, higher pay for senior enlisted personnel, increased family separation allowance, more funding for family support centers. All of this to be offset by a modest roll-back of the tax bonanza that we granted to people making $1 million a year and more.What was the response of Mr. Cheney and his party? Forget about the troops. Our allegiance is to people making $1 million a year or more.I do not have any statistics, Mr. Speaker; but I suspect there are not too many millionaires serving in Iraq or going soon.",

But I will tell my colleagues this: as much as I opposed this attack on Baghdad and, as I termed it at the time that a war would break out after we made this dash to Baghdad which is, in fact, what happened, as much as I opposed that, we bear responsibility too. And I want to indicate to people that we are down on this floor not just because we need to hear ourselves talk; we are down on this floor because this Congress needs to be accountable too. The very questions that the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) has been asking, this Congress should have been asking. We should not have allowed ourselves to be pushed into doing the most profound and fundamental thing that any Congress can do and that any President can do, which is take us into war. This should be a lesson to all of us, including and perhaps starting with the Congress.The Constitution says only the Congress can declare war. When did it happen that we turned it over to the President to make his or her own decision on that issue? We have a responsibility, too; and I want to indicate to everybody, at least for this Member, and I think I am probably speaking for the other Members on the floor here, we intend to come back here, not because we are doing penance, but because we are doing oversight, the oversight that we should have done before. Maybe the same conclusion would have been arrived at, I do not know, I doubt it; but we should have been doing these things.No commission should be looking into this right now. The plain fact is we should be looking into it, and that is what this Iraq Watch is going to do. We may not have the benefit of having the President in front of us or Mr. Cheney or others, but we have the benefit of understanding what the revelations have been and what their meanings are and to search for the truth, and that is our obligation. And I hope that if nothing else comes out of all of this, that in future the Congress will take seriously its obligation and carry forward on the understanding that only the Congress can declare war; and it should be only done over the most thorough and complete examination as to what has taken place and what the strategic and moral interests of the United States are.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I think it is unfortunate that the discussion here has gone off in directions about what constitutes patriotism or what constitutes the proper recognition of the defense of democracy, because that is how all this argument started.Mr. Speaker, I want to indicate to the Members that this issue deserves a full discussion and not just on the floor. We would not be here and there would not be a motion to recommit, which will be made shortly, I can assure you, if we had a full discussion about this and then had gone, probably where it should have gone, to the Committee on the Judiciary, if it needed to go at all, or a decision could have been made as to whether that was the proper venue.I, too, can have recollections about what happened during Vietnam. I daresay that a lot of people on the floor, Members of this Congress, were not involved in any of that. I know what the first amendment is all about, and I do not think the first amendment says that the Secretary of Defense gets to decide what other people get to say or do in this country under threat of some kind of sanction. To the degree or extent that someone is prevented access that they are entitled to, they have recourse in the courts. That is what we do in a democracy.I do not notice that it is our job, certainly not in the Committee on Armed Services, to turn over to the Secretary of Defense, any Secretary of Defense, the opportunity to be a prosecutor and a judge and a jury and a sheriff all at the same time.Now, the facts are, as to the origin of this argument today, that there apparently have been instances in which people disagreed, apparently in some law schools in particular, disagreed with the ``don't ask/don't tell policy'' of the United States Armed Forces. This has nothing to do with what people said or did not say about the Vietnam War. It has nothing to do with what any particular Member's view of that American involvement in the Vietnam war was, let alone the war on terror or anything else. What it has to do is with the present policy, whether you agree with it or not, with the armed services.Now, if the Armed Services say they want equal access, what was being said apparently by the people at these various schools was that they did not have equal access to being able to join the Armed Services or the Department of Homeland Security, I suppose, or the CIA. Now that needs to be discussed, and it is not going to be discussed in 3 minutes or 5 minutes or 2 minutes here on the floor. It is not even going to come up.Now I could not find the proper way to make a motion to try to get this before the Committee on the Judiciary so we could have a discussion on what the proper sanctions might be, if they were needed at all, with respect to gaining access for the ROTC or anybody else that want to recruit. I am in favor of that. Those of us who oppose this bill are in favor of it.I resent on proper grounds here in the House being categorized as someone who somehow wants to thwart the war on terrorism or does not have the correct view on the Vietnam War because I am trying to defend the first amendment and because I would like to see these discussions held in a manner and in a place and in a venue which is appropriate to the circumstances. We need to talk about such issues as to whether everybody in this country is going to be treated equally with respect to being able to join the military or participate in the Department of Homeland Security or defend our security interests through the CIA and whether they can be hired on the basis of their ability and what they have to offer rather than on what they look like or what their sexual orientation is or anything else. This is not the bill to do it, and it is certainly not the Secretary of Defense who should be doing it.So what I am asking here is that the Members try to exercise some common sense, some common legislative sense, give us an opportunity to take up this serious issue, which does need addressing, and address it in a manner that will resolve it under constitutional methodology that is worthy of this body.",

That is the reason the bill is on the floor.I realize a lot of Members and their staffs are listening to this discussion in their offices, and they cannot be on the floor because they have other duties; but I am asking them to pay attention to why the bill is on the floor. This bill gives the Secretary of Defense the basis. We are creating another problem instead of solving the problem which is really before us, which is access for ROTC and/or military and other recruiters. If Harvard or any other school is preventing them from coming on, is there no access to the courts? You mean no law exists in the United States to allow people to have proper access? Of course it exists.The reason for this bill is to make the Secretary of Defense the arbiter of how this is going to take place, even up to the point of getting certification from the school that the Secretary of Defense is satisfied that equal access, et cetera, is going to be provided.My point is that we are doing this all wrong. If we really want to solve this issue of openness and access and discussion that needs to be taking place and to have the ROTC or the CIA or the Homeland Security Department or whoever it is have access and dialogue and discussion on a civilized basis as to how it should take place, that is available to us. This is not the way to do it. This bill merely enables the Secretary of Defense to be judge and jury over that process, and it will generate a whole new slew of lawsuits that will not solve the question nor even address the question that is before us as to how do we achieve this access. I want that access.I think it is very unfortunate that the bill is being posited to the body in such a manner that those of us who oppose it seem to be in favor of terrorism or approving arbitrary dislocation of legitimate endeavors to recruit for the ROTC or anybody else. That is not true. On the contrary, I raised the issue in the Committee on Armed Services precisely on the point that I am a libertarian on the issue of free speech and access, and I believe everybody should engage in dialogue and confrontation of the issues in a positive way that gives everybody a chance.The reason the argument takes place in the first place is that people who are defending those who are prevented from having access to the armed services, apparently those who are gay or lesbian or transgender or whatever other category we are getting into these days, I cannot keep up with every permutation that apparently exists in terms of gender and sexual orientation, but that is not a reason to make the Secretary of Defense the arbiter of it. I do not think, despite his great wit and great perception and depth of interest in world history and events, that the Secretary of Defense is necessarily up on all the latest in transgender fashions. And so I do not think that this is a proper forum nor a proper venue to try and resolve this issue.My request, Mr. Speaker, of the body is that we give a chance for a motion to recommit to be made so that we can address the issue of access as opposed to addressing the issue which the bill moves toward giving a basis for the Secretary of Defense to make this decision. Let us not confuse the access apple with the orange of the first amendment of the Constitution.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, as was indicated by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Meehan), the previous speaker, I think all we would like to have here and the reason for recommittal motion is to have some hearings. As the chairman, and I do not if he is still on the floor or not, the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services Committee knows, I have the greatest respect for him and the greatest respect for the bipartisanship that exists on the Committee on Armed Services.The issue here and the only reason this bill is on the floor is that a court determined that the Secretary of Defense did not have a basis in law for being able to make some of the kinds of decisions which the bill in front of us allows the Secretary to make. The issue involved here is one of access. It is one of equal treatment. The arguments of whether one accepts them or do not accept them have been made that the armed services, I suppose by extension of the bill, the Department of Homeland Security, the CIA, are not allowing equal access to every American and at least in some instances on the basis of their sexual orientation. There may be other issues that are raised in that regard, too. That is worthy of discussion, surely. Whether or not then this bill constitutes a proper response to that difficulty to the degree that it exists is the issue.The reason I am asking for a vote on recommittal with instructions is not because I oppose or anyone else, I believe, opposes equal access either for recruitment purposes or other purposes of discussion and dialogue but rather that this bill does not address that fundamental issue and, in fact, will only engender a new series of lawsuits and it will fail to accomplish that which is really the bottom-line, fundamental issue here before us, which is how do we appropriately address the first amendment in the context of recruitment, whether it is for a Federal Government agency of any kind, let alone whether or not the Secretary of Defense should be the arbiter in that regard.So, Mr. Speaker, with that I am asking that the body vote to recommit with instructions so that we can properly address this serious issue.Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",

Well, does the gentleman recall that while we were unable to prevent looting, mass looting not just of the Baghdad museums, the history of the entire Middle East, really the Mesopotamian history there, but unable to stop looting in virtually every area of Baghdad and throughout Iraq, hospitals, schools, businesses, everywhere, was it not interesting the Oil Ministry was guarded? And I wonder how that took place. I wonder what the emphasis was.Would the gentleman be interested in a story from USA Today of March 29, Monday, as follows: ``In 2002, troops from the Fifth Special Forces group who specialize in the Middle East were pulled out of the hunt for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan to prepare for their next assignment in Iraq. Their replacements were troops with expertise in Spanish cultures. The CIA was stretched badly in its capacity to collect, translate, and analyze information coming from Afghanistan. When the White House raised a new priority, it took specialists away from Afghanistan in an effort to ensure Iraq was covered.''USA Today added, ``Those were just two of the trade-offs required because of what the Pentagon and the CIA acknowledged is a shortage of key personnel to fight the war on terrorism,'' not the engagement in Iraq, the war on terrorism that we hear about all the time. ``The question of how much those shifts prevented progress against al Qaeda and the other terrorists is putting the Bush administration on the defensive.''Troops with the capacity to hunt Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan were removed and sent to Iraq. Now I believe the gentleman will observe there is a renewed emphasis on catching and capturing or killing Osama bin Laden, as if this had been put into limbo for some period of time.I wonder if the gentleman would observe, as I do, that there may be more than a coincidence here with respect to what he has just been sharing with us?",

We can see what the results are.I would quote to the gentleman from the Financial Times of Monday, a report which indicated that a United Nations body will warn this week that Afghanistan is in danger of reverting to a ``terrorist breeding ground.'' That is the phrase utilized in the Financial Times story characterizing the United Nations' report, that Afghanistan is in danger of reverting to a terrorist breeding ground with an economy dependent on the illegal drug trade, unless the international community significantly increases development funding for the war-torn country.Now, we have billions and billions and billions, tens of billions of dollars to be expended in Iraq at the present time with its economy in collapse, except, we are told, for its ability to produce oil. The economy in Afghanistan is now reverting to the pre-Taliban days. If the gentleman will recall, we supported the Taliban to the tune of $40 million because it was involved in eradicating the drug trade. The drug trade has come back with a vengeance. It is now supplying funding in the absence of any international effort being made in Afghanistan and, as a result of the switch in emphasis on terrorism from Afghanistan to Iraq, particularly in the wake of what I contended to the gentleman at the beginning of my statement that it was deliberate. It is not incomprehensible if it is a deliberate policy of the administration to find a methodology of presentation to the country sufficient to raise the fear factor to a level that would allow this invasion to take place. That was the purpose and the intent all along, and the result that the administration has to be held to account for is that Afghanistan now is reverting to a status in which it could be called a terrorist breeding ground in a United Nations report.",

Members may be familiar with the program Marketplace. It is on the radio and follows the National Public Radio news, All Things Considered, the afternoon edition of it. There is a business broadcast called Marketplace which reviews the market decisions, the business activities of the country, and in their series entitled The Spoils of War, Members will find that the money which otherwise might have been spent, according to the contract that your company represents, to provide armor for the Humvees is now going out at the rate of tens of millions of dollars a week, perhaps a month, in graft and corruption through the Bank of Iraq, with nothing in the way of any kind of accountability under the Provisional Authority, Mr. Bremer's Provisional Authority.This is being done today. They are done with DGs, or director generals, of the various Iraqi ministries. They are the equivalent of under secretaries. They go into the bank and walk out with cardboard boxes full of cash. Corruption is in the hands of clerks who simply rubber-stamp the action, and the American companies that are over there taking the money are paying bribes, are involved in mass corruption, and this is where the money is going. This is what the Provisional Authority is involved in. This is what is happening.We cannot respond to you and your constituents in Ohio and those people in Ohio who are capable of providing armor for our troops because we have to make sure that those who say they were on our side, those who say they were the sources of Iraqi information and intelligence and upon whom we could rely are the very ones who are involved up to their eyeballs in corruption and graft in Iraq and Baghdad itself to the detriment of our own troops' capacity to be able to defend themselves.",

    "text": "In that context, I can tell Members as someone who was part of the first group to go into Iraq right after the initial attack on Baghdad, going from the Baghdad airport to Saddam Hussein's palace where Mr. Bremer was being installed and displacing General Garner, and we were there the day after he had taken control there, we said to him at that time, you can have all of the equipment in the world, but as I said to him, Mr. Ambassador, driving from the Baghdad airport to Baghdad itself and to this palace that we now occupy, you are going to have to have 10,000 soldiers who guard that highway. I do not care what kind of equipment and armor you have, you do not arm a Humvee and then send somebody out to play lottery with their lives. No matter what the equipment is, when you only have a strip of tar coming across the desert, no lights, no protection, nothing, I said it is going to take 10,000 soldiers.The plain fact of the matter is when General Shinseki, who had responsibility for the well-being of his soldiers, indicated as chief of the Army that it would take hundreds of thousands of soldiers, hundreds of thousands of Army and Marine personnel and support in order to initiate and sustain such an attack and deal with the aftermath, he was entirely correct. We need not just more equipment, we need a political policy that provides a foundation to bring this to a resolution.And in order to accomplish that, we have to have sufficient personnel unto the date, and the Secretary of Defense and the President consistently have denied this to our people in the field and indicated to me shamefully all along if they wanted more, all they have to do is ask. We know what the message is. The message is they are not here; they cannot be there. And why? I will tell the Members. Because many members of our committee, Republican and Democrat alike, and when I say our committee, the Committee on Armed Services, have tried for several years now to increase the number of people in the Army and the Marine Corps, that is to say that can be recruited and retained as active-duty forces. It is called end strength. What is the end strength? The end of the numbers that we have in the Armed Forces. We said, absent a significant increase in the number of Army troops and Marines available, we inevitably would have to call on Guard and Reserve.I beg to differ with the gentleman's remarks and the gentlewoman's remarks in one sense only, the phrase ``our young men and women.'' Let me tell my colleagues something. Tune into the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer every night on PBS, and respectfully and with dignity they close every program in silence with the pictures and short biographies of the people who have been killed, and chills run down my arm as I reach out to say it, and we see over and over again sergeant so and so, 43 years old; master sergeant somebody, 50-something years old; 38 years old. These are teachers. These are police officers. These are fire fighters. These are Guard and Reservists. They are not young men and women. Not that being young in itself makes one a candidate for these pictures, but that is who we tend to think of. This is a volunteer force, and the Guard and Reverses are volunteers, and they are being shamelessly exploited in this sense. We now have a draft in this country. We have a draft by default because the Guard and Reserve are being pulled into active-duty service and their terms of enlistment are being extended arbitrarily by the Department of Defense.Therefore, I conclude, and thank the gentleman for yielding, by saying, yes, we have to provide the equipment; but we have to provide the people and the policy behind it that will allow us to resolve this issue.",

    "text": "If the gentleman would yield, both he and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) have made the point over the last several minutes that a lack of planning, a lack of clear-sighted planning has brought us to the present path.I would like to cite an article in The Washington Post for summary purposes made just yesterday. At the confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, where Mr. John Negroponte, Mr. Bush's nominee to be ambassador to Iraq, was being questioned, the summary in the story by Walter Pincus and Colum Lynch is as follows: ``Panel members expressed confidence in Negroponte while voicing skepticism that the United States had a clear enough strategy in place for Iraq.''Let me be a little more specific, specific in the words of Mr. Negroponte with respect to his assuming the ambassadorship in Iraq and planning for what is going to happen to our troops and what is going to happen to Iraq in terms of its sovereignty: Under questioning by Senator Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, when asked what would happen if there was disagreement between Iraqi authorities and the United States military over how to handle a situation similar to the unrest in Fallujah, that would require, ``a real dialogue between our military commanders, the new Iraqi government, and, I think, the United States mission as well,'' Negroponte said. Think about that. Can you imagine a combat situation such as is faced right now in Fallujah. It has nothing to do with the competence or incompetence of the United States military; it has everything to do with the competence or incompetence of the political policies that put the military in that situation. We are now faced with circumstances in which military action becomes the political policy, that in order to support the political policy, you have to support military action, whatever it might be.Going on, in the end, however, Negroponte said, ``The U.S. military is going to have the freedom to act in their self-defense, and they are going to be free to operate in Iraq as they best see fit.'' Operate in their self-defense.Mr. Negroponte, perhaps unconsciously, recognizes we are not on the offense.We are not accomplishing any mission. What we are saying is, what I have said on this floor, that on June 30, the United States military is going to set adrift in a desert sea of political anarchy where our military action will be self-defense. Is that what we are sentencing the United States military to? A daily round of defending itself? For what? Under what circumstances can we justify the continued presence of the United States military if their sole military purpose according to the ambassador nominee to Iraq is to defend themselves?Continuing, what is more, he said, Iraqi military forces ``will come under the unified command of a U.S.-led multinational force. Negroponte emphasized the interim government will not need law-making authority because it will just have two prime functions: running 25 government ministries and preparing for next year's election of a transitional national assembly. Among the most sensitive aspect of the U.S. transition plan has been what has been called the transitional administration law devised by the United States and its appointed Iraq governing council.''At the White House yesterday, Mr. Scott McClellan, the press secretary, told reporters, and I am quoting from the article ``that an annex to the transitional law is being written that will limit the interim government's power.''",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I come before the House this evening in this special order representing those of us who have participated in what we have termed ``Iraq Watch.''For some period of time now, several of us have come before this House to try to analyze in a hopefully dispassionate way but in an informative way what is taking place in Iraq and what the implications are for us here in the House of Representatives, and by extension for the Nation in terms of the political ramifications.I come here tonight by myself because the other members of Iraq Watch, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel), the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Strickland), the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee), and others who have joined us periodically are otherwise occupied this evening. But I come here representing those who have participated because of the seriousness of the issues that are now confronting us with respect to Iraq.I have before me, Mr. Speaker, a copy of the May 3, 2004, issue of the New Yorker Magazine entitled ``Torture at Abu Ghraib.'' I cite this, Mr. Speaker, because I am afraid we are going to hear this phrase on more than one occasion in the days to come. It is written by Seymour Hersh, subtitled ``American Soldiers Brutalized Iraqis, How Far Up Does the Responsibility Go?'' I am citing this to the Members this evening, Mr. Speaker, because this is the only comprehensive report that I, as a member of the Committee on Armed Services, and as a Member of the House, have been able to get. I was intrigued by it because it mentions two reports. The speaker before me, the gentleman from New York, mentioned a report written by Major General Antonio Taguba, who happens to be by coincidence from Hawaii, but he did not mention nor have many other venues that I have observed, television, radio, newspapers, articles, et cetera, another report. The report from General Taguba being completed in February of this year, but that followed on a report that was written and submitted in November of last year, November of 2003, by the Provost Marshal of the Army, the chief law enforcement of the Army, General Provost Marshal Donald Ryder.I think that I can begin to account for the tone, at least the summary of the tone as far as it has been delivered to us, which is one of outrage. I withdraw that. That is my characterization.But let me put it this way: I believe it is fair to say if Mr. Hersh's summary is correct, that General Taguba's report was, at a minimum very, very intense, and that Mr. Hersh stated as follows: Its conclusions about institutional failures in the Army prison system were devastating. I think that is a fair summary.The reason I am citing this to you, Mr. Speaker, is that at a meeting this afternoon, at a briefing this afternoon, convened under the direction of the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, under his auspices, officers appeared. Given the nature of the hearing, the secret nature of the hearing, again, for good and sufficient reason, I cannot cite to you and will not cite to you the exact dialogue that took place, nor those who were involved in it.But, suffice to say, it was confirmed to me in that hearing, I should say in that briefing, that there was indeed a report given to General Sanchez, the Supreme Commander in Iraq, in November of last year, and that General Ryder, according to Mr. Hersh, indicated in November, and this is important. The reason we are going through this now and the reason I am going through this recitation is these incidents did not just happen. They did not just appear out of nowhere.This is not something that the Army was aware of only in February of this year, that there was some kind of shock recognition by the Army that this was taking place in February. Because General Ryder clearly warned, quoting now from the Hersh article, ``that there were potential human rights training and manpower issues system-wide that needed immediate attention.''It also discussed serious concerns about the tension between the missions of the military police assigned to guard the prisoners and intelligence teams who wanted to interrogate them.Again, I will go on, another quotation: ``Army regulations limit intelligence activities by MPs to passive collection.''I think this is an important point, because I see some of these National Guard people who have been identified and who have had their pictures on television and are being pointed out and being looked to for responsibility. I think it is important for those who may not be familiar with the situation in prisons, Army prisons, military prisons, that Army regulations limit intelligence activities of MPs to passive collection.Something obviously went awry here. There was evidence, according to the Ryder report, evidence going back as far as the war in Afghanistan. Now we are going back even previous to 2003. We are talking about post-9/11 and the attack on the Taliban forces in Afghanistan.According to the Ryder report, as reported by Mr. Hersh, the MPs had worked with intelligence operatives to ``set favorable conditions for subsequent interviews,'' a euphemism, according to Mr. Hersh, for breaking the will of prisoners.Now, Mr. Hersh indicates that the Ryder report called for the establishment of procedures to ``define the role of military police soldiers, clearly separating the actions of the guards from those of the military intelligence personnel.''I am citing this detail to you, Mr. Speaker, because I think it is very important to establish a context here. General Ryder is the Provost Marshal of the Army. He is the chief law enforcement officer of the Army, and he in his report indicated serious questions with regard to the management and operation of the prison system, and indicated serious reservations about the kinds of expectations of the MPs with regard to military intelligence activity.Major General Taguba in his report, and, again, I am relying on the Hersh document because, to the best of my knowledge, these reports were not made available even to the intelligence committees, let alone to the Committee on Armed Services, either in the other body or in the House of Representatives.General Taguba was reported as saying, ``Unfortunately, many of the systemic problems that surfaced during Major General Ryder's assessment are the very same issues that are the subject of this investigation.''It amounts to an indictment, Mr. Speaker. I do not know any other way to put it. That is why I say I feel so badly coming down here today. Believe me, this brings no sense of satisfaction to me, to have to report this to you.If the Army was aware at the highest levels of the difficulties and challenges that existed, let alone the possibility of abuses or even undermining of good order within the Army in terms of what is expected of its personnel in the prison system, and was aware of that in the fall of 2003, it can hardly have come as a surprise then if General Taguba was exercised by what he found taking place in February of 2004.If indeed General Taguba's report is as detailed and as explicit and its recommendations as clear as it appears to be in the summary given to us in Mr. Hersh's article, how is it possible for the Secretary of Defense, who, after all, is in charge of the uniform military, and the Speaker is well aware of our constitutional circumstances here. The civilian authority is in charge with regard to what the policies of the United States military are going to be. How is it possible for the requisite authority in the Department of Defense not to be aware of what these issues were?It is very difficult for me to believe that General Sanchez kept this to himself, or that General Sanchez failed to act on the clear warning that General Ryder, his chief law enforcement officer, expressed to him in writing in November of last year. It is difficult for me to believe that there was not some awareness in the Department of Defense that there were possibilities here for disaster, political and military disaster.Mr. Speaker, it is fair, I suppose, for someone to ask, well, yes, of course we can see why you might be upset as a Member of Congress that you were not informed. And I am, I can assure you of that. In fact, I will cite to you, Mr. Speaker, in a few moments a letter received by the ranking member of the committee, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton), from the Secretary of Defense, that at best misleads, deliberately misleads the ranking member in questions that he had about private contractors, and at worst is a deliberate subterfuge and challenge to this Congress. Not to Democrats or Republicans. I am talking about a challenge to Congressional authority.I tell you, Mr. Speaker, we are walking on the edge of fascism in this country if the executive or executive departments think that they are able to make decisions absent the direction and will of the Congress of the United States. For good or for ill, Mr. Speaker, you and I are elected by the people of this country. Secretary Rumsfeld is not elected by anybody. He is an appointment and serves only because he has been approved by the Congress of the United States, in this instance the will of the other body as embodied in their charge in the Constitution.For good or for ill, the people of this country have put their faith and trust in us to make those decisions. We have clear jurisdictional lines in the Committee on Armed Services. We have clear admonition under the Constitution as to what our duty is and our obligation is under that Constitution with respect to funding and managing the United States military.For any executive, or anyone in the executive branch, to assume that he or she can take legislative authority unto themselves, particularly when it comes to oversight, is something that is anathema to the constitutional order. Executive authority, ruling by executive authority, has a fascist tinge to it that I find very, very troubling. I do not think it can be excused by the idea that we would be better off without knowing.I do not know if this is true, Mr. Speaker. I have only the media representations to me, seen in fleeting images and heard in passing tonight. But if I understood correctly and if the information is correct, the President of the United States found out about this from the media. The President of the United States was not informed that these issues were already underway and about to break in the public press.We are told, at least I am informed, again by media presentation, because we have not had any briefing or explanation of this in the Committee on Armed Services to my knowledge or to the Congress as a whole, that General Myers, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in fact asked a broadcast network, I believe the CBS network, not to publish or broadcast news of these events that it had before it and was prepared to bring forward.This is a startling development in our country, that this kind of censorship can take place, because we are not talking here about putting members of the United States military in harm's way because of the revelation of immediate plans of attack or the assumption of military planning that would otherwise bring aid and comfort or information to forces that might attack us or do us harm. This was not an instance of that.On the contrary, if what has been presented so far is true and is an accurate reflection of what took place, these are clear violations of regulations in the good order in the United States military and a severe blow to the activities of the United States with respect to the reconstruction of the physical facilities in Iraq and the establishment of civil government in the wake of the collapse of the Hussein regime.It strikes me that when the ranking member makes a request, as he did on April 2, and the ranking Member, as you know, is the senior minority member, in this instance the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton). He serves as the senior Democratic member on the Committee on Armed Services under the leadership of the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter).On April 2 Mr. Skelton wrote a letter to Mr. Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense. I would like to quote it to you in some length.``Dear Mr. Secretary. I would like to first extend my sympathy and display over the recent brutal killings in Fallujah. All of the killings in Iraq, both of our troops and of contractors and civilians, have been unacceptable and tragic, but the murder and desecration of the four Americans working for Blackwater USA was particularly barbaric. I would hope that plans are being prepared for a measured but powerful response. One of the issues raised by this tragedy is the role played by private military firms such as Blackwater.``Media reports indicate at the time of the ambush the personnel in question were providing security for a food delivery convoy. I understand that Blackwater provides personal security for Ambassador Paul Bremer. I would like to request that you provide my office with a breakdown of information regarding private military and security personnel in Iraq.''That bears repeating, Mr. Speaker: ``I would like to request you provide my office with a breakdown of information regarding private military and security personnel in Iraq. Specifically, I would like to know which firms are operating in Iraq, how many personnel each firm has there, what specific functions they are performing, how much they are being paid, and from which appropriations account. Additionally, I would like to understand what the chain of command is for these personnel, what rules of engagement govern them, and how disciplinary or criminal accusations are handled, if any such claims are levied against them.''This is in April, early April. These questions, these measured, sober, serious questions regarding the privatization of this war are being asked by the senior minority member of this House of the Committee on Armed Services.``Firms like Blackwater are clearly serving important functions in Iraq and putting themselves at risk. It is important that the Congress have a clear sense of the roles they are playing so that we can conduct effective oversight. I appreciate your assistance in this matter. Sincerely, Ike Skelton, Ranking Democrat.''I think by any measure, Mr. Speaker, this would be seen as a letter that, as I have already indicated, is sober and serious and measured in its content and specifically and particularly on the mark with respect to the role and responsibility of private contractors.Why am I bringing that up? Because it appears, Mr. Speaker, that there are serious instances of perhaps a blurring of institutional and responsibility lines, with private contracting, military intelligence, and the conduct of the prison guards and those in charge of the Army prisons.Why I am particularly exercised even more than I was this afternoon? Because I thought this afternoon, well, we have to try and determine where we are going to go, and I put out a release to that effect in order to answer to my constituents as to what the thoughts were on this issue at this time. I thought, well, we better be careful about making grand pronouncements about what we need to do and where we are going to go until we find out all of the facts and see where they lead. But I will tell my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, I have come to the conclusion that the Secretary of Defense has to think very seriously about resigning. I have come to that conclusion only since this afternoon, late this afternoon, early this evening, rather, when I became aware of the answer to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) dated May 4, the date that I received this, May 4 is printed on here; whether it was written May 4 or whether it was received in the office of the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) on May 4 is difficult for me to determine. It may be that that is a stamp to indicate to my office that it was received in my office on May 4.But here is the answer given by Donald Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense: ``Thank you for your letter of April 2 regarding private security personnel. A discussion paper provided by the Coalition Provisional Authority responding to the points that you raised is attached,'' and it is.Now, here is the answer given by the Secretary of Defense with regard to private companies, knowing, knowing now, this is April, knowing about the report of November 5, knowing about the 30-plus or 35 investigations under way, according to reports that we have received in the press, which I think reflect accurately some of the conversation that was held this afternoon. Multiple, let me put it this way, multiple investigations under way. Knowing that, knowing that he had the report of General Taguba before him, knowing that this material had been deliberately asked to be censored and withheld from publication in the network news.Here is what he says: ``Some private security companies called PSC, private security companies, under contract in Iraq provide, one, personal security services for senior civilian officials, as well as some visiting delegations. Two, they also provide physical security for nonmilitary facilities inside the green zone and convoy protection for nonmilitary goods. Three, they provide protection for government support teams consisting of Coalition Provisional Authority personnel and government contractors who team with local Iraqi officials to develop local government structures and functions.''Not a word, Mr. Speaker, about the role of private contractors and military intelligence or in the prison system. How is it possible for the Secretary of Defense not to mention this, given the context in which this answer was given to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton)? That is why I am so exercised about the contempt that the Secretary is showing for the Congress and yes, indeed, for the President of the United States. How is it possible for the Secretary of Defense to face Mr. Bush, let alone this Congress, and say that he deliberately, I cannot think of any way else to characterize it, deliberately kept us from understanding what it was that these private contractors were doing in this prison context.He goes on to say: ``It is my understanding that most of these private security companies doing business in Iraq do not work directly for the U.S. Government.'' Well, who are they working for then? They work under subcontracts to prime contractors to provide protection for their employees, as if there is some benign presence. We are in the middle of a war on terror, we are told. We are in the middle of a war in Iraq. The Speaker is well aware that I characterized this more than a year ago in May when we returned, when we were among the first group to go with the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), some of us went with him, among the first group to enter Baghdad after the initial attack on Baghdad and some of us said, yes, there was an attack on Baghdad and now the war is starting.Unfortunately, that has proven to be only too true, for the Secretary of Defense to pretend in the middle of a war situation in which our troops are put at risk, that somehow, there is this semi-benign presence in Iraq, of private contractors to go about their business without the supervision or the oversight of the Department of Defense and the United States military. I mean, it is an insult.``A draft CPA order, Coalition Provisional Authority order, on regulating the private security companies which will require certain data from each firm has been prepared with input from the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior.''I mean, the contempt of this letter is incredible.``The Iraqi Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Trade will be largely responsible for the administration of this and any revisions that may be promulgated by the Iraqi interim government after June 30. Finally, the Department of Defense is drafting uniform guidance regarding private security companies employed in Iraq under contract using U.S. appropriations.''It is as if it does not even exist at this point.``I hope this is useful. We can provide additional information or briefing if you would like.''Then we have a summary here in the attachment which includes a list, Mr. Speaker, of the private security companies operating in Iraq.Now, I believe that there was a company called CACI. I do not precisely have that because I do not have the report here; I am looking for it in this list of private security companies operating in Iraq. Perhaps it is listed here, but I cannot find it among the 60, the 60 companies that are listed here. It may be that I am not sufficiently conversant with the actual names and acronyms of the security companies that were working intelligence privately in Iraq. I would be more familiar with it had we been briefed on it, had we been given the information, as is not only our right, but our obligation to have in the Committee on Armed Services.I cannot find it. It is very, very difficult for me to believe that we are in a situation, post-Watergate in which it is necessary to know the answer ahead of time in order to ask the right question. It seems to me the questions posed by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) are clear enough. It seems to me that the answer here, while probably technically correct, leaves out valuable information. This is clearly not an exhaustive list of the private companies that were involved.I concentrate on this, Mr. Speaker, because I think we face a serious crisis here in the Congress. If we are going to allow the executive to conduct this war in our name, the name of the people of the United States, and we constitutionally have not only the authority, but the responsibilities of legislating the policies associated with arming and supporting our military, our United States military as well as establishing the policies of this Nation to be carried out by the executive. The executive does not tell us what to do. We again, for better or for ill, are given and required by the Constitution to exercise that legislative authority.The legislation we have put together, the policies that we have assume by virtue of a majority activity in both Houses of this Congress, are what constitutes the policies of this country that will be carried out by the executive. The executive can inform of his or her desires in this regard, but we are the ones that have to decide this. We are the ones that have to exercise the oversight.So I say to you, Mr. Speaker, that these are very, very serious allegations. No question about that. I do not come here this evening speaking with any kind of relish or enjoyment of what is required of us here. But I can tell you I was a probation officer in my life. I have been an officer of the court. I have had professional responsibilities in county jails, in San Quentin Prison. I know what it is like to have to conduct drug tests. I know what it is like to appear at a booking desk every morning year in and year out. I know what is involved in investigations in arrests and prosecutions.I know what is involved in making reports on what needs to be done and how it should be done and what the conducts of officers of the courts are with respect to the management and maintenance of jails and prison systems.I have legislative responsibilities with regard to how prison systems are run and under what circumstances and what is required of the personnel as a legislator. I have been the chairman of a committee with responsibility for the police departments in Honolulu, the Honolulu Police Department, under the jurisdiction of the committee that I was privileged to serve on and chair in the city and counties of Honolulu. I understand what is at stake in prison system, and I know this from my own personal experience, what is required in a prison system is, first of all, certainty, certainty.You must know from the top to the bottom exactly what the rules are. Certainty and activity. Those are the two fundamentals. Once you have those established in a prison system, then you know where you stand. Nobody can talk to me about failure to train some National Guard operatives on the jail cell level and tell me that they were operating on their own. That does not happen, Mr. Speaker. It does not happen in the county jail. It does not happen in a state prison. And it does not happen in a Federal prison system. Certainty from top to bottom is required. If it does not exist that is failure of leadership that has to be accounted for and responsibility has to be taken.So far as I can see right now, there is some reprimands being handed out. There are some court-martials being held at the lowest possible level. And yet we have two reports, the Ryder report and the Taguba report, that I do not believe for a moment did not see the light of day at the general officer level and at the highest levels of the Department of Defense.If it is true that the President of the United States was not informed by his Secretary of Defense as to what the situation was and what was likely to happen, that is dereliction of duty on the part of the Secretary vis-a-vis the President of the United States. It is far worse in my estimation that you let down the person who has entrusted you, entrusted you with the responsibility for carrying out the executive policies of this Nation.It is bad enough that the Congress of the United States was not informed. But they have the President of the United States left in the dark on something that was sure to have incredible negative ramifications with respect to Iraq and the position of the United States is unforgivable. It is intolerable. But I know as sure as my own experience indicates, that it is not possible for the leadership at the levels that I have discussed not to have been aware that at minimum the possibilities of this disaster was there and needed to be addressed. At a minimum. And worse, that they knew it was going on and tolerated it.We need to have a full exposure of exactly who knows what. Not because, Mr. Speaker, I wanted to have some kind of a media field day or some kind of a tabloid extravaganza, but because the very responsibility of this Congress is at stake. Either we are informed, Mr. Speaker, about what the situation is and where we are going so that we can make a decision with regard to oversight or we are not.So, Mr. Speaker, in conclusions, I want to ask you in your role as Speaker, to acknowledge the facts that this is a requirement of the Congress of the United States, that we exercise oversight on behalf of the people of this Nation and the values of this Nation. If we do not do it, Mr. Speaker, who is going to do it?It is apparent that no one wants to take responsibility in the Department of Defense. No one wants to take responsibility in the military at the present time. No one is exploring right now exactly what the boundaries were or were not. No one is examining the role of private security corporations in the intelligence gathering on behalf of the United States military and on behalf of the security interests of this Nation. No one asked me about it, I can assure you on the Committee on Armed Services as to whether I thought that was a good idea. I cannot speak about the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, but I am hard pressed to think that the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Republican or Democrat, this has nothing to do with the partisan nature of any kind of political discussion we might be having, but it is difficult for me to believe that anybody on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence sanctioned such a thing or that there was knowledge of it in the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence or that it would not have been shared with the Office of the Speaker at a minimum with the leadership of both sides of the aisle.We have to have an understanding of whether our role as overseers of the United States strategic interests is going to be honored. If we do, then perhaps we can reestablish some credibility. If we do not, then I fear that the role that Secretary Rumsfeld has assumed for himself, namely, chief operating officer of the United States, without any responsibility to the chief executive of this Nation, the President of the United States, or any responsibility to the Congress of the United States. He gets to decide what we will do and what we will not do. He gets to decide whether or not this country is going to be put into a series of circumstances and situations that are totally untenable in terms of the values of this Nation or what the goals and aspirations we have with regards to our security interests and the peace of the world.I think that we need to have a clear understanding that unless the Secretary can answer these questions he has to consider resigning. He has to consider whether or not we are going to have a cleansing of the way in which this war is being conducted, in the manner in which it was being reported to us in the Congress and by extension to the people of the United States.I appreciate the fact, Mr. Speaker, that these are difficult questions, that I have only been able to present a summary of what is at stake here; and I appreciate your patience and forebearance as I have enunciated it.I do think very, very clearly, Mr. Speaker, that there this is something that has to be addressed, and I would hope that the leadership of the House, both majority and minority, will settle on the proper venue, which I personally believe to be the Committee on Armed Services, but perhaps a joint committee situation, in which these issues are explored; and I hope that the Secretary of Defense will be able to answer adequately what his responsibility and obligation is.",

    "text": "If the gentleman will yield further, last evening I had an opportunity to speak in a special order, and I indicated then and I indicate again tonight in the wake of the gentleman's suggestion that the President was ill-served by those in authority who failed to inform him fully as to what all the conditions and circumstances were.There is no excuse for the leadership in the Department of Defense not informing the President of the United States as to what he might be facing with respect to the outcome that was here. I pointed out last night that this situation did not just develop with CBS on 60 Minutes II within the last 7 days. A report by the Provost Marshal of the United States Army, Major General Donald Ryder, in November of 2003, was in the hands of General Sanchez and in the hands of the Department of Defense and the Secretary in the fall of last year.In the wake of that, I have here and am displaying to my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, Article 15-6, investigation of the 800th Military Police Brigade. This was the report that was requested on January 19, 2004, subsequent to the Provost Marshal's investigation and report, which indicated severe difficulties, tensions between military intelligence-gathering and proper prison conduct by those in charge of the prisons, indicating that there were training problems, operational problems that needed to be addressed. And so on January 19, Lieutenant General Sanchez, Lieutenant General Sanchez, the commander of the Combined Joint Task Force 7, requested that the U.S. Central Command appoint an investigating officer, and that investigating officer, of course, was General Taguba. His report responded to the admonitions of Lieutenant General Sanchez that an investigation of detention and internment operations be undertaken, starting from November of 2003. November of 2003 is when the report went in, indicating that there had to be steps taken to address these questions.Let me quote from the opening paragraph. ``Lieutenant General Sanchez cited recent reports of detainee abuse, escapes from confinement facilities, and accountability lapses, which indicated systemic problems within the brigade and suggested a lack of clear standards, proficiency, and leadership.''Fifty-three pages later, and if the gentleman will grant now, I will not cite over and over again what is taking place in here, but one shocking event after another.This 53-page report, and this comes from CQ Today, Congressional Quarterly Today by Neil Soros from the CQ staff, and he quotes, ``The 53-page report drafted by Army General Antonio Taguba, and based on an investigation into the abuse allegations,'' that is this report that I hold in my hand, ``that began in January was finished in April. The report was detailed in this week's New Yorker magazine. At a Pentagon news conference today, Secretary Rumsfeld defended the time it takes to release such information.''Now, this information was available from November of last year.Quote: ``I recognize the appetite of people for instant information and instant conclusions,'' he said. That is to say Secretary Rumsfeld. ``These things are complicated. They take some time. It required interviewing people back in the States who had already left Iraq that required discussions with people. They are proceeding in a very systematic and appropriate way, and to the extent I conclude at any time there is some slice of it that has not been investigated, has not been looked at properly, you can be sure I will undertake such an investigation.''Clearly, the Secretary of Defense is dissembling and somehow thinks that everybody in this country can be fooled as to what his responsibility is. The Secretary of Defense has known, at least since November of last year, what was going on and did not even inform the President of the United States, because the Secretary of Defense, as I said last night, apparently has assumed that he is the chief operating officer of this country and that he does not need to inform the Congress, he does not only not need to inform the Congress, but does not even need to inform the President of the United States.I yield to the gentleman from Ohio.",

    "title": "ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to speak here this evening on Asian Pacific American Heritage Month Special Order. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues on the congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus to recognize Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. As a member of the caucus's executive committee, I want to honor the many achievements and contributions of more than 11 million Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent in our country.As has been mentioned by the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case), back in 1978 my friends and colleagues, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, former Senator Spark Matsunaga, former Representative Frank Horton, and former Representative Norm Mineta, helped establish the first 10 days of May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Week. Fast forward to the 102nd Congress: legislation establishing the entire month of May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month was signed into law.The congressional district I represent is composed of approximately 70 percent Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. There is a special strength and resilience embodied in Hawaii's unique cultural mix. We have chosen to be defined by our diversity rather than divided by our differences. That resolve to work together with Aloha can serve as an example for the rest of the country and I might say, Mr. Speaker, for the world.For those of us from the State of Hawaii, there is something missing in this year's heritage month celebration, however: the dynamic presence of our colleague Patsy Takemoto Mink. Patsy fought all her life for social and economic justice. Throughout nearly 50 years of public service, she championed America's most deeply held values: equality, fairness, and, above all, honesty. Her courage, her willingness to speak out and champion causes that others might shun resulted in tremendous contributions in the fields of civil rights and education. She has earned an honored place in the history of the United States House of Representatives as the co-author of title IX, which guarantees equality for women in education programs. Every single woman in this Nation who today has access to equal opportunity in education and by extension in virtually every other field of endeavor owes a debt to Patsy Mink.She was one of the pioneers who transformed Hawaii and transformed the Nation. Whenever any of us felt some sense of discouragement, whenever any of us felt some sense of despair or feeling we could not succeed, it was only required for Patsy to come into the room to change the atmosphere. Patsy Mink had the capacity to make dead air move. Patsy Mink, this little dynamo from Hawaii, was a giant in her heart and in her commitment. I miss her every day. I measure all I do by her unfailing standard of integrity.She would be the first to say while we can look at Asian Pacific American Heritage Month as a time to recognize and celebrate many individual accomplishments, we must also take action. The other members of Hawaii's congressional delegation and I are working every day to respond to the issues raised by people of Hawaii and the Nation. I hope I can work productively to resolve them, always remembering that our Nation should be defined by our diversity rather than be divided by our differences. I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Honda).",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that these discussions that we have held and are holding weekly on the floor here are meant to communicate with our colleagues and with the American people. This is our forum to do it. I think those who may be observing our proceedings here today need to take up, if they believe what we have said tonight, the cause of having Mr. Bush remove his support from Mr. Chalabi.I think people across the country have to ask their representatives, as well as communicate with the White House. They have to ask their Representatives and Senators, do you support this Chalabi administration and the Iraqi Governing Council? Do you support Mr. Chalabi being a part of this sovereignty movement after June 30? If you do, there have to be serious questions about your competence to be holding office and acting on our behalf.This is a question that needs to be asked. Americans need not feel impotent, they need not feel they are merely observers of what other people are doing to you and doing to this country. You can demand of your elected Representatives and Senators, where do you stand on this Chalabi issue?It is not a matter of getting an individual, I am sure we all agree. He is representative of a failure of leadership. His position in the Iraqi Governing Council is an insult to those people who have been wounded and who have been killed during this war. It is an insult to those of us who uphold genuine ideas about freedom and democracy and their spread. So long as this man is there, being the official representative of the United States to the Iraqi Governing Council, to that same degree will we be disenabled from achieving any of these goals, regardless of how one feels about going to war in Iraq or not.This is what needs to be done. You have to demand of your representatives, where do you stand on this issue of his continued presence as being officially supported by the United States of America?",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield, I think what is important here then to get across this evening is that calling people to account is what we do. The oversight function of the Congress has a long history. I can go back to the time in which some people wonder how Harry Truman got to be chosen as Vice President of the United States just prior to Franklin Roosevelt's death, before his last campaign. Of course, he had made his reputation on an oversight committee in the Senate looking into war profiteering, is what he had done, trying to hold people to account. That is what this is all about.If someone wants to take up the position that this is a concentration on President Bush for partisan activity, he is the President. He is making the decisions, and those decisions are subject to scrutiny.As the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton) very well knows, back at the time when Mr. Clinton made decisions about Bosnia and Kosovo, I found myself in opposition to him and said so. I think at least as far as this Member is concerned, I do not have to take a back seat to anybody in trying to bring anybody to account in the executive, Democrat or Republican, if I think that is in order.If I know my friend, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton), well, and I think I do, he does not stand for anybody telling him who should be brought to account either. He has stood up on more than one occasion, perhaps even singularly, calling for an accounting on various issues. I think that is his function and our function, and that is what this Iraq Watch is all about, I can guarantee you that. If we think somebody is doing the right thing, we are going to say so; if we think somebody is not acting necessarily in the best interests of the United States, regardless of what their motivation might be, it is up to us to say so and engage in a dialogue to try to illuminate where the interests of the American people are.I know that the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton) agrees with that, and I look forward to any discussion we might have in the future along those lines.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is not interference at all, believe me, because this is complementary to what has been said. I can tell the gentleman on April 20 of this year, he is thinking about an army. Here is what he said to the Committee on Armed Services, Mr. Wolfowitz said, on April 20: ``There is no question it would be nice right now to have a larger army.'' These are the same people that were claiming, and reclaimed again today, that General Shinseki was wrong. He did not mention General Shinseki, but he went out of his way to make sure that everybody understood that we did not need a greater Armed Forces even though he said so; it would be nice to have a larger Army but absent that, after all, we can on the 200,000 security forces that he says are now in place.I have his testimony here before me, a written statement given today before the Committee on Armed Services in which he indicates on Page 3 that we are going to be full partners with the Iraqis. This has to do with the sovereignty issue, that they are going to take the lead, he says elsewhere, that they have 200,000 Iraqis in a security force that is a ``work in progress,'' an interesting way of looking at it, that according to the Prime Minister, as related by Mr. Wolfowitz, they are ready to take charge on July 1. There has been enormous progress.So I asked him today, well, is there an end in sight? And there is no end in sight. It is schizophrenic. I pointed that out to him today. On the one hand, everything is fine, everything is working according to plan, maybe a little bit behind schedule, but nonetheless working its way right along; and on the other hand, we are going to have to be there forever as some kind of partner. I asked partners, I understand the word ``partner'' and the phrase ``full partner.'' What does it mean in terms of who is in charge in relation to these young and men as well as some older members of the Guard and Reserves who are being killed and wounded? Who is in charge? I cannot get from General Pace, I cannot get from Secretary Wolfowitz, who is in charge. Who makes the decisions? They are talking about a partnership on all levels, regional, national, and local; a unity of command; a consensus on the way ahead. And it is supposed to be working out of what are called joint operating centers. How these joint operating centers are supposed to make any decisions regionally or locally or nationally is beyond me.What is clear from the testimony today is all the discussion that has been taking place about the reasons for going to this war have been entirely set aside; and now apparently what the mission of the United States is, is to act as some kind of backup force, according to them: ``U.S. forces are there to help out. They are backup.'' That is the motto, a backup force for whatever is to take place now to achieve some kind of nation-building. That is now what our mission is all about. It has nothing to do with weapons of mass destruction. It has nothing to do with anything else that was used as a reference point for why we are going to war, an immediate threat to the United States in terms of weapons of mass destruction, some kind of military connection to terrorist organizations that are an immediate threat to the United States.",

If there was not anything before, we have now created it as a result of the actions that we took based on this false information.So now the situation has been redefined. The war on terror has been redefined to be the activities of what are termed killers and terrorists and all kinds of anecdotal references as to what that means. We have to go no further than what happened today, an assassination in Mosul of the head of a law school and her husband being beheaded, killed with her and beheaded; another American soldier dying; roadside bombings, all the rest of these kinds of activities taking place so that what was going to happen, in my judgment, on July 1 is that the American military will be set adrift in a desert sea with no compass, with no direction, with nothing except to provide backup under this full partnership in these so-called joint operating centers to make decisions about what we are going to do with the military in Iraq. I was unable to determine today from Mr. Wolfowitz exactly what the role of the Guard and Reserve forces and what the deployment schedule are going to be.I asked, is there an end in sight? I got Korea, 50 years. I got Germany as an answer. I got Bosnia as an answer. I said, if that is the case, if you are going to cite Bosnia, which he does over and over again, in Bosnia there has been a steady drawdown of troops. Times and schedules are announced. Troops have been drawn down. If we are talking about Korea or Germany, none of the conditions prevail in South Korea or Germany that prevail in Iraq today. So, the analogies are at best totally inaccurate and have nothing to do with what is taking place today in Iraq.The question remains, if the reasons for going to war have now proven to be at best inadequate, and, at worst, false and misleading, and deliberately so in order to fulfill whatever ideological agenda was then in place in the Bush administration, the fact is now that the mission of the United States military is to somehow provide a backdrop, a foundation or background to this increasingly apparent civil war that is now underway in Iraq.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, as you know, and our friends know, we have been engaged in a conversation for some months now with regard to what we have come to term the Iraq Watch; and I was very pleased to note that my good friend and esteemed colleague, the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), indicated in the last hour that he and other Members were occupying, that they would be pleased at some point, perhaps in the future, to work out an opportunity for a dialogue, not necessarily a debate, but a conversation among friends with respect to Iraq and its implications for the United States, perhaps even combining hours. I do not know what the rules are precisely on that, and I do not ask for a ruling on that right now, Mr. Speaker; but at some point we hope to be able to do that, hopefully for the benefit of the membership and for those members of the American public and others that may be tuning in to our Special Orders.For this evening's opportunity, however, I wanted to begin our discussion tonight with some references and observations over the so-called handover of sovereignty. I think, Mr. Speaker, you might agree that with respect to Iraq, and unfortunately not only Iraq, there tends to be opportunities for the media in particular to seize on certain phrases. They become almost phrases of art. These phrases then substitute for a whole panoply of analysis that might otherwise usefully take place.In this instance, the phrase that I am referring to is the so-called ``handover of sovereignty.'' Handover of sovereignty, what that means is not clear to me at this stage.What I did observe during our break was a ceremony which took place under very, very strained circumstances. The television news was suddenly filled with the ominous music, the drumbeats, the portentous rhythms that seem to indicate that something of spectacular import is about to happen. Breaking news. Stentorian voices, a sound, and then suddenly we are told, well, we are going to go to the handover of sovereignty in Iraq. It is to take place in secret. It is to take place with a pool reporter there, apparently a pool camera. It is in some secret room somewhere in the green zone, presumably, I guess, in one of the palaces, or what are referred to as palaces, in Baghdad; and, suddenly, there is Ambassador Bremer and some folks there with handshakes and pieces of paper passed back and forth. No real idea of what it is all about other than smiles and handshakes all around.And suddenly sovereignty ostensibly has been transferred or handed over. That it took place in secret, that it took place ostensibly to prevent terrorist activity from disrupting it probably speaks more about what the handover was actually all about and whether or not the word ``sovereignty'' might properly apply.In both instances, I think not. There was no handover of sovereignty. How can there be sovereignty when you do not control your armed forces, when the first pronouncements of your ostensibly sovereign government involve the possibility of imposing martial law on your own people and indications that the governing authority, that is to say the Coalition Provisional Authority under Mr. Bremer, still absent him in person, is going to be in charge of the military activities, presumably, according to this handover of sovereignty ceremony, under some kind of group discussion terminology.Again, I fail to understand exactly how this ``partnership,'' which was referred to between the so-called sovereign Government of Iraq and the Government of the United States through its military, is supposed to take place.It is unclear to me that the questions that I asked of Assistant Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz in our Committee on Armed Services hearings, unclear to me whether these questions were answered. I simply said, ``Who is in charge? Who has the authority?'' And what I got was the usual dissembling and allusions to the idea of group discussions taking place. I am not quite sure how one responds to military situations in the arena of group discussions, but I suppose it is possible.My own thought at that time was, and I said at that time and repeat again tonight, that my perception was that at the turnover of sovereignty, at least as best I was able to understand that term, the American military would be set adrift on a desert sea and would find itself in a situation of being the first responders in an Iraqi crisis and that we would be uncertain as to who exactly was issuing the orders and under what circumstances they would be obeyed.This constitutes, for me, a crisis of another character, a crisis for us to answer; and in that context it is clear to me that the handover of sovereignty amounts to little more than a propaganda device meant to try to distance the political consequences and implications of our occupation from the political realities as the election approaches.Obviously, people will have to make their own minds up on that score; but in relation to that then, among the first pronouncements of this sovereign government was that under consideration was a possible policy of amnesty and that the amnesty would extend to those people who had murdered American troops, those people who had been involved in the insurgency that has taken place since the hostilities or major hostilities were pronounced at an end, i.e., mission accomplished by Mr. Bush some time ago on the infamous aircraft carrier stunt.And subsequent to that, obviously this insurgency, again, this is a term that has been adopted by the media uncritically, has resulted in numerous deaths and woundings. Most members of, certainly, the Committee on Armed Services and other Members of the House of Representatives and members of the subcommittees of the other body have traveled both in their districts and here in Washington and in Germany to hospital situations where we have been able to speak with and, hopefully, bring some measure of comfort and support to members of the military who have been wounded, members of the military and others, including civilian employees. But all that has taken place since this pronouncement that the war was essentially over, that the major activities surrounding the invasion was over; and now we find that this sovereign government is contemplating offering amnesty to those people.Now, if that is in fact what this has come to, I think the implications and consequences are serious indeed. There is no question in my mind that there will be some very serious dialogue taking place in this Nation if that is what this was all about, the opportunity for a government that has come into being solely as a result of the activities of the United States of America subsequent to the invasion, including and subsequent to the invasion of Iraq; and now we find a general amnesty being contemplated.That was never discussed, to my knowledge, with any members of the Committee on Armed Services. It was never discussed, to my knowledge, with members of the subcommittees of Congress generally as to whether or not that was something that we could abide. One would think that at a minimum this sovereign government in Iraq would have the courtesy, if only out of respect for those who have died and those who have been wounded on their behalf, to at least engage in some form of a dialogue with the United States in regard to that possible amnesty.I see my friend from Washington is about to ask for the floor, and I would be happy to yield to him.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, because just before I came back, let me give my colleagues something so that it is not abstract. I will tell my colleagues exactly what I had to deal with and what came up while we were away on our holiday.My staff representing my delegation was briefed by Major General Lee, the adjutant general of the State of Hawaii, on the situation of the 29th Brigade, Hawaii Army National Guard. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army approved the alert of the 29th Brigade for deployment to Iraq. Earlier indications were, of course, that the 29th would be deployed to Afghanistan; but the situation on the ground in Iraq now requires additional soldiers from the 120,000 now there, and the enhanced 29th Brigade is needed.Now, this is happening all across the country; and if anybody thinks for a second that the 5,000 or 6,000 that are going to be involved in this current recall-up, involuntary call-up is going to solve it, I think they are dreaming.The 29th is one of the two remaining National Guard brigades not yet activated. It will perform reinforcing missions.Remember when I indicated here before that when this so-called sovereignty occurred, the United States military would be set adrift on a desert sea.They will perform reinforcing missions, whatever in God's name that means. The expected deployment will be 12 months. The brigade will have to travel off-island to train up, because the normal training entity, the 25th division, of course, is now deployed itself. The brigade may go to Fort Bliss, et cetera; expect the deployment to Iraq to take place shortly.Then what do we have to do? The adjutant general then had to brief all of the mayors that once the alert notice was released in Washington, we had to then discuss what the impact would be on homeland defense and natural disaster impacts back in Hawaii, because the Guard normally is going to address those situations. The National Guard is, of course, the primary backup to civilian authority. Now we are going to have to rely on the Air National Guard since most of the Army National Guard is going to be deployed. Now, this is just in Hawaii.Now, we can imagine what is taking place elsewhere all around the country? Part of our problem area in Hawaii is that the police and fire departments are going to be adversely affected because a major portion of the Army guard are police officers and firefighters and teachers. So there will be about 2,500 soldiers from Hawaii and about 3,500 coming from American Samoa, Guam, and California. Now, that is just one instance; and that is the reality.I want to conclude by saying the impacts on this are considerable, because the employers, whether they are public employers or private employers, have to take into account the absence of these folks at this particular time. What is happening right now is we are denying what the realities of the necessities for troops are in Iraq and Afghanistan and are masking it over with Guard and Reserve deployments; and we are going to have to pay a fearful price for that.I yield to the gentleman from Washington.",

The company, which employs 30,000 workers from 38 countries in support of the U.S. military, said it had been unaware of the workers' concerns until recently.''This is the kind of thing, Kellogg Brown, Halliburton, is always unaware of, workers problems, because they are too busy having their accountants going to work on the excessive profits they are making.It brings to mind the work that was done by one Senator Harry Truman when, during World War II, he had his committee on a bipartisan basis looking into the question of excessive profit-making from World War II. This is not something that is invented for this time and place by members of the Democratic Party. This is something that was headed up by a Democratic Senator, who was in charge in the United States Senate, on a bipartisan basis, to see to it that profiteering does not take place at the expense of the American soldiers or the expense of the American taxpayer.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3479, the Brown Tree Snake Control and Eradication Act of 2004. This measure will not only ensure continued security for Hawaii and Guam, but the entire Pacific region.The Hawai'i Biological Survey has documented that an average of 177 alien species arrive in the State of Hawai'i each year. Out of all the possible alien plants and animals that could make their way to the Hawaiian Islands, one of the most feared is the brown tree snake.The brown tree snake arrived in Guam on military materiel transport from the Solomon Islands after World War II. Because Guam has no natural predator for the brown tree snake, the snakes have been able to flourish and have been recorded as high as 10,000 snakes per acre. The brown tree snake is blamed for the extinction of 9 out of 11 bird species native to Guam. These snakes also cause frequent and costly power outages and are known to bite humans. Like Guam, Hawaii has no native snakes and no natural predators for snakes. Only one pregnant brown tree snake needs to reach Hawaii in order for the State to experience the same catastrophic consequences as Guam.Wildlife Services under the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in the Department of Agriculture provides brown tree snake control on Guam by inspecting outgoing military and civilian cargo and providing trapping services at Guam's ports. These services interdict 6,000 to 7,000 snakes annually and have proved to be very successful in keeping the brown tree snake out of Hawaii.For the past 10 years, the funding for these services has remained fixed. The program was able to make up for inflation and increasing costs by stopgap measures that have enabled them to continue services. However, this is no longer possible. Unforeseen vehicle repair or replacement costs, critical travel associated with program delivery, required training for staff, increased costs of operations and growing containment responsibilities are forcing significant reductions in operations. Compounding the problem, Wildlife Services has been informed by Anderson Air Force Base that it will have to begin to pay for in-kind services that have been provided to the program at no cost since 1994. To compensate for this additional unanticipated financial burden, further reductions in staffing are anticipated in early fiscal year 2005.H.R. 3479 would begin to resolve these problems by recognizing the seriousness of the threat posed by the brown tree snake. This legislation authorizes the Departments of Agriculture and Interior to fund brown tree snake interdiction and control efforts and provide grants for these efforts. Just as important, this measure would support research efforts to control and eventually eradicate this harmful species from Guam. Current funding does not allow for in depth research that could lead to less labor intensive solutions than the current bait and trap method. This legislation also requires the establishment of pre-departure quarantine protocols for persons and cargo traveling from Guam. This will ensure that this species is not able to spread to other Pacific destinations.Madam Speaker, this legislation is being considered at a crucial point in time. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and thank Chairman Pombo and Ranking Member Rahall for their continued efforts to address the problems of the distant Pacific. I would also like to thank Congresswoman Bordallo and her staff. Without the effort of all of these parties, this legislation would not be before the House today.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 163, a bill to re-instate the draft. I oppose the draft and do not want to see it brought back.I added my name to this bill in order to promote an open, honest public discussion of the personnel crisis facing our military today, and in that sense I welcome today's vote. It is unfortunate, however, that H.R. 163 is being brought to the floor with only a few hours notice, depriving the American public of the extended exploration this problem deserves.It is not a coincidence that today's vote is taking place as public uneasiness is rising with regard to the draft. It is obvious to everyone that the demands of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are narrowing the Administration's options. Our regular divisions and brigades are stretched to the limit. The Reserve and National Guard are being drawn upon to the point where they now comprise nearly half of all U.S. troops in Iraq. Stop loss is the order of the day, holding servicemen and women in uniform past their discharge dates. We're even dipping into the Individual Ready Reserve, calling up people who have completed not only their active duty obligations, but their active reserve obligations as well. Under these circumstances, the growing suspicions of the Administration's intentions in regard to a draft are well-founded.In fact, I have found confirmation of those suspicions. KITV television news of Honolulu reported last night on a February 11, 2003, Selective Service System document which was provided to me recently and which I have shared with several of my colleagues. Judging from its contents, it appears to be a memo prepared for a meeting between the Acting Director of the Selective Service, the Principal Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, and other senior Defense and Selective Service officials. The document takes note of critical shortages of military personnel with certain skills and raises the idea of drafting them to alleviate the shortages.Features of this ``bring back the draft'' memo include:--Draft registration for women as well as men;--Registration of all citizens and resident aliens between the ages of 18 and 34;--Require registrants to submit periodic updates of their skills and education up to the age of 35;--Draftees would be sent not only into the military, but also to the Department of Homeland Security, state, and municipal government agencies; and--Suggests the House and Senate Armed Services Committees be asked to pass legislation to bring back this expanded draft.The public deserves the chance to fully consider and discuss these radical ideas and participate meaningfully in any decision to adopt such drastic steps to address the very real personnel needs of our military forces stemming from the demands of multiple deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, and beyond. Bringing H.R. 163 to the floor for a vote without hearings, without warning, deprives the Nation and the Congress of an opportunity for that full consideration and discussion.Right now we have a back door draft, euphemistically called stop loss orders, that keeps troops in uniform even after their enlistments are over. At the same time, we are putting our National Guard and Reserve under intolerable strain, keeping them on active duty far longer than they or their families could have anticipated.One of the most frustrating aspects of these problems is that they were foreseeable. General Eric Shinseki, then Army Chief of Staff, accurately predicted we would need far more troops than the Administration was willing to commit to occupy Iraq. He was publicly condemned by the Administration for telling the truth. I voted against the Iraq war because, among other reasons, it was clear the Administration was unwilling to send enough troops to pacify that country after the initial military attack. Paul Bremer, the former chief of the Coalition Provisional Authority, just confirmed that fact in a speech yesterday.If we are to meet this troop strength crisis, a serious and open discussion needs to take place involving the public, elected leaders, and senior national security officials. The Administration wants to operate in secret in order to hide that discussion from the public. Bringing H.R. 163 to the floor for a vote is a partial victory for public discussion, a reflection of the public's insistent concern over the issue. On the other hand, the furtive way in which it was brought to the floor is a partial victory for those who want to keep the issue in the shadows.We have been dealing with this matter for years in the Armed Services Committee. During the 14 years that I have served on the Committee, the questions have never been as urgent as they are now:--What happens if a quick victory in Iraq is elusive, and we remain there for years to come?--What troop strength levels and mix of active, National Guard, and Reserves will be needed in the coming years?--Can the all-volunteer military keep its ranks filled?--If not, what options does the nation have?--How can we get better pay, benefits, and quality of life improvements to attract and retain enough troops and their families?As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I work on a daily basis with my colleagues and military leaders in the search for answers. It is a long and often difficult process. Its worth is measured in improvements in the lives of our fighting men and women, their families, and our veterans.I was proud to vote for badly needed equipment like Humvee armor protection and stronger body armor for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. I have championed better military family housing for troops based in my home state of Hawaii and around the globe. I was one of the authors of the Tricare for Life bill, which provides military retirees with the health coverage they were promised when they enlisted.What solutions are offered by those who want to pretend we don't face a military personnel crisis? Do they support the Administration's covert moves--despite public denials--to restart the draft? What do they have to say about the stop loss orders that deny thousands of troops and their families the post-service opportunities they were led to expect? How do they propose to deal with our over-reliance on the National Guard and Reserves, which are already strained to the limit? Most importantly, will they discuss these issues fully and openly, or do they want them decided in secret?",

    "title": "TOPICAL AGENDA",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, great interest has been generated by the publication of a document from the 11th of February 2003 entitled ``Topical Agenda''. It involves the Department of Defense Personnel and Readiness Undersecretary and the Selective Service System and its Acting Director.This document appears on the web site of ``Rock the Vote''. The interest is intense because of the content of the agenda. It involves a review of selective service major policy issues since 1973; a synopsis of Department of Defense Policy regarding the draft and a detailed proposal for the renewal of the draft and conditions attendant to it.The participation of the Department of Defense in the discussion associated with the agenda has been confirmed by the Secretary of Defense. The DOD contention is that the meeting on the agenda was for purposes of discussion only and that it took place off Pentagon premises. Obviously, the location of the discussion and the origination of the agenda for discussion purposes is immaterial to the issue at hand. The point is the Department of Defense from the Secretary on down has vigorously denied that any such discussions have ever taken place let alone been contemplated. This document shows that a detailed proposal for a new draft involving men and for the first time women has been under consideration and discussion by the Department of Defense. It also clearly indicates that consideration has been given to drafting not only for military needs but for purposes associated with the Department of Homeland Security. In addition it proposes that the draft age be extended from 18 to 34. It includes a proposition that a ``self-declaration'' of skill sets be required of all potential draftees to be periodically updated until the age of 35.It is not enough for the Department of Defense to say it rejects the proposal and its findings. Saying ``no'' doesn't make it so. Denials that any such consideration has even been given let alone presently extent ring hollow in the wake of the implications of this agenda and the Department of Defense's participation in discussing it.Given the broad and deep concern of the public about the draft and the possibility of its being reinstituted it is imperative that the public be enabled to see, understand and analyze what the Department of Defense has had under consideration. The public, of course, can draw its own conclusions. The ``Agenda'' report follows.DoD Participants: Hon. Charles S. Abell, Principal Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness; Mr. William Carr, Acting Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Military Personnel Policy; Colonel David Kopanski, Deputy Director, Accession Policy. SSS Participants: Mr. Lewis C. Brodsky. Acting Director of Selective Service; Mr. Richard S. Ftahavan, Director of Public &amp; Congressional Affairs.1. A hedge against underestimating the number of soldiers, needed to fight a future war; 2. A symbol of national resolve to potential adversaries; and, 3. A link between the all-volunteer Armed Forces and society-at-large. Clinton also instructs SSS to increase operational efficiency. Instructs DoD to update MOB requirements for SSS, re-examine timelines, and review arguments for and against continuing to exclude women from registration. F. 1994--Defense issues new ``post-Cold War'' guidance to SSS: ``provide first untrained draftee to MEPS at M+193; first Health Care draftee at M+222,'' DoD reaffirms that it is not necessary to register or draft women (for a conventional draft of untrained manpower) because they are prohibited by policy from serving in ground combat assignments. SSS recognizes women may have to be included in a health care draft. G. 1998--DoD Health Affairs says health care personnel would be needed earlier than M+222 in a future conflict. Guidance changed to M+90. Today, HCPDS can be implemented, but ability to meet M+90 time frame is doubtful. Program not fully tested and compliance aspects still not complete. H. 1995 through 2000--Anti-SSS Members of Congress almost successful in eliminating SSS through the appropriations process. SSS undergoes structure and program reductions to make ends meet. Readiness suffers. I. 2000 and 2001--DoD and SSS plan and implement joint mailing project to increase peacetime relevancy of SSS and improve timeliness and address accuracy of DoD recruiting direct mail campaigns. J. 2002 and 2003--Administration says use of draft not an option for war on terrorism or potential war with Iraq. Rep. Rangel and Sen. Hollings introduce bills (H.R. 163 and S. 69) call for reinstituting a draft for military and national Synopsis: With known shortages of military personnel with certain critical skills, and with the need for the nation to be capable of responding to domestic emergencies as a part of Homeland Security planning, changes should be made in the Selective Service System's registration program and primary mission. Situation: Currently, and in accordance with the Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) [50 U.S.C., App. 451 et seq.), the Selective Service System (SSS) collects and maintains personal information from all U.S. male citizens and resident aliens. Under this process, each man is required to ``present himself for and submit to registration'' upon reaching age 18. The methods by which a man can register with Selective Service include the Internet, mail-back postcard, checking a box on other government forms, and through the driver's license applications process in many states. The collected data is retained in an active computer file until the man reaches age 26 and is no longer draft eligible. It consists of the man's name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth. Currently, 91 percent of all men, ages 18 through 25, are registered, enabling the SSS to conduct a timely, fair, and equitable draft in the event the Congress and the President decide to reinstate conscription during a crisis. However, the Secretary of Defense and Department of Defense manpower officials have stated recently that a draft will not be necessary for any foreseeable crisis. They assume that sufficient fighting capability exists in today's ``all- volunteer'' active and reserve Armed Forces for likely contingencies, making a conventional draft of untrained manpower somewhat obsolete. Yet, Defense manpower officials concede there are critical shortages of military personnel with certain skills, such as medical personnel, linguists, computer network engineers, etc. The costs of attracting and retaining such personnel for military service could be prohibitive, leading some officials to conclude that while a conventional draft may never be needed, a draft of men and women possessing these critical skills may be warranted in a future crisis, if too few volunteer. Proposal: In line with today's needs, the SSS' structure, programs and activities should be re-engineered toward maintaining a national inventory of American men and (for the first time) women, ages 18 through 34, with an added focus on identifying individuals with critical skills. An interagency task force should examine the feasibility of this proposal which would require amendments to the MSSA, expansion of the current registration program, and inclusion of women. In addition to the basic identifying information collected in the current program, the expanded and revised program would require all registrants to indicate whether they have been trained in, possess, and professionally practice, one or more skills critical to national security or community health and safety. This could take the form of an initial ``self- declaration'' as a part of the registration process. Men and women would enter on the SSS registration form a multi-digit number representing their specific critical skill (e.g., similar to military occupationa1 specialty or Armed Forces Specialty Code with Skill Identifier), taken from a lengthy list of skills to be compiled and published by the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. Individuals proficient in more than one critical skill would list the practiced skill in which they have the greatest degree of experience and competency. They would also be required to update reported information as necessary until they reach age 35. This unique data base would provide the military (and national, state, and municipal government agencies) with immediately available links to vital human resources . . . in effect, a single, most accurate and complete, national inventory of young Americans with special skills. While the data base's ``worst-case'' use might be to draft such personnel into military or homeland security assignments during a national mobilization, its very practical peacetime use could be to support recruiting and direct marketing campaigns aimed at encouraging skilled personnel to volunteer for community or military service opportunities, and to consider applying for hard-to-fill public sector jobs. Local government agencies could also tap this data base to locate nearby specialists for help with domestic crises and emergency situations. With the changes described above, SSS programs would be modified to serve the contemporary needs of several customers: Department of Defense; Department of Homeland Security (FEMA. U.S. Border Patrol, U.S. Customs, INS). Corporation for National Service, Public Health Service, and other federal and state agencies seeking personnel with critical skills for national security or community service assignments. The SSS would thus play a more vital, relevant, and immediate role in shoring up America's strength and readiness in peace and war.2. Return the SSS to ``Deep Standby'' status. If a draft of any kind is highly unlikely and undesirable, eliminate peacetime registration and dismiss the 10,000 trained volunteer Board Members. However, should a draft be needed, it would take more than a year to get the system capable of conducting a fair and equitable draft from Deep Standby status. 3. Restructure the SSS and shift its peacetime focus to accommodate DoD's most likely requirements in a crisis. Plan for conducting a more likely draft of individuals with special and critical skills. a. Minimum requirement: SSS mission guidance and time lines must be redefined promptly by DoD to allow more relevant pre- mobilization planning and funding for the possibility of a critical skills draft at M+90 of sooner. Peacetime registration of men 18 through 25 would continue, but consideration would also be given to identifying men with certain critical skills among these year-of-birth groupings. A post-mobilization plan would also be devised and computer programming accomplished for a full-blown critical skills draft. The HCPDS program is completed, brought to the forefront of SSS readiness planning, and tested through exercises. Without a reaffirmation of relevance and adjustment of mission, the SSS will be an easy target for reduction or elimination by detractors in the Congress and the Administration. b. Expanded pre-mobilization requirement: SSS peacetime registration expanded to include women and men, 18 through 34 years old, and collects information on critical skills within these year-of-birth groupings. Requires change of law and additional funding (see Issue Paper dated 11 Feb 2003). B. If more examination of the issue and options is needed, consider forming an interagency task force to provide the Administration with a policy recommendation. Possible players: DoD, SSS, DHS, NSC, OMB, Corporation for National Service, PHS, others. C. After suitable analysis, obtain a White House Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) announcing plans for the future of the SSS (course of action l, 2, or 3, above). D. If the SSS is to expand its pre-mobilization activities to include registration of women and collection of critical skills identifiers, it will be necessary to market the concept for approval by the Armed Services Committees and Appropriations Committee draft implementing legislation for congressional consideration. The changes will be implemented after the amended law is signed and funding is identified.",

    "title": "IRAQ WATCH",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, the gentleman mentioned the main road from Baghdad and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) indicated earlier tonight that we have been holding this Iraq Watch special order for some period of months now. Those who have listened to us before may recall that I have mentioned in the past that I was privileged to be in the first delegation of American Congress Members who were able to get into Iraq, leave the Baghdad airport and go into what is now the Green Zone in May after the initial attack on Baghdad.We were there in late May on the day that Ambassador Bremer took the reins of control from General Garner. Forgive me for going over some past ground, but, unfortunately, what is being cited by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) and by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Strickland) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) tonight requires this for a very simple reason.When we hear of standing up or creating this Army, creating these forces, that was the goal that was stated to us the very first day that Ambassador Bremer was there, supposedly based on the work that General Garner was supposed to be doing up to that time. And we continue to have reports in the presses as if this is something suddenly just discovered.On that day, we sat at the table with Ambassador Bremer and General Garner. I recall very clearly saying to them, we have just been down this road from the airport, the international airport in Baghdad here, and I said to them. You are going to need 10,000 soldiers just to guard that highway. I said. It is a strip of tar going from the airport in the middle of a desert into Baghdad. This is not the Big Dig up in Boston or entering metropolitan Atlanta. This is not finding your way around Philadelphia or New York. This is a strip of tar from another big strip of tar where planes land into Baghdad. I said, there are no lights. There is no possibility of being able to stop people planting mines or coming up with shoulder-held rocket grenade launchers, explosive propellants of all kinds.And now here we are nearing the end of 2004, and you cannot even go on that road today. This is a debacle. This is a disaster. This is taking place right now in circumstances in which we are observing generals saying to their troops, witnessed by embedded reporters with television cameras, drawing the analogy to Hue in Vietnam.I am old enough to have been involved in the discussions that took place during the 1960s with what we were doing in Vietnam with a half a million soldiers and an indigenous Army fighting with the South Vietnamese that could fight, that was trained and was equipped. And the analogy was Hue in Vietnam. Fallujah is going to be like Hue. Hue was a disaster for us. A few more wins like that, and we are completely undone.What we forget is the actual military activity that took place had nothing to do with the war in the sense of whether or not we would be successful politically or militarily. The actual circumstances of the combat and the capabilities of the soldiers, all of which have been cited by us over and over again, that is not the issue. The competency of the American soldier is not the issue. The willingness of the American soldier to fight or the bravery, the professionalism, that is not the issue as such. Whether they are equipped properly, of course, that is an issue for us, but the political reality is this is an unmitigated disaster. We are setting the foundation and groundwork, if you will, for decades, if not centuries, of opposition to us as a result of what is going on right now.You need only go to look at how it is characterized around the country. I was visiting with my mother in Florida, and I have been to Massachusetts. I have gone all over the country. The Palm Beach Post, the Providence Journal, how is it characterized? Here is what the Providence Journal said on Monday, November 15.``The absence of insurgent bodies in Fallujah has remained an enduring mystery.'' It is no mystery. This is a guerilla fight.In the same paper:``But much of the city lay in smoking ruins. Isolated bands of rebels still harassed American and Iraqi soldiers.'' Rebels against what? ``The military victory appeared to be nearly overshadowed by insurgent violence elsewhere, particularly in the northern city of Mosul.''Again quoting:``The Governor of Mosul province, saying he had lost faith in local security forces, called in thousands of Kurdish militiamen for the first time to quell the insurgent uprising there.''Today a hearing was held on the staffing requirements, the personnel requirements for the Guard and the Reserve, testimony at the Committee on Armed Services today. Happy faces, it was characterized to me by a Republican Member here tonight, a stalwart member of the committee. And I reiterate again with respect to the many times we have appeared on the floor, this is not a Republican versus Democratic issue. The Committee on Armed Services tries not to operate in that kind of a context. We try to operate on the basis of the security interests of the United States. One of our colleagues said to us, ``They put on happy faces today.'' What the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) has just quoted, what these other two of my colleagues here have been quoting is that we are living in a fantasy. I was asked by a former Member today, What are you doing over at the Capitol? I said, We're organizing our delusions. We are in the midst of organizing our delusions.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my late colleague Robert T. Matsui. While his life was cut tragically short, his many achievements and contributions to our Nation will serve as a constant reminder of his hard work, integrity, and determination to advocate for those who were not able to fight for themselves.Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1978, Bob served the people of Sacramento for 14 terms focusing on the city's public safety by bringing adequate flood protection to his hometown. He also served as a senior member of the Committee on Ways and Means, covering an array of policy issues such as preserving Social Security for future generations, as well as having adequate basic healthcare rights for children. Most recently he served as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee leading the Democratic Party's congressional effort for the 2004 cycle.When he was 6 months old, Bob, a third-generation Japanese American, and his family were taken from their home in Sacramento and interned at the Tule Lake Camp after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1942. He carried this experience with him throughout his life. In 1988, he helped steer the Japanese-American Redress Act through Congress, in which the government formally apologized for the World War II internment program and offered compensation to victims. This experience helped shape his strong belief that every American is entitled to basic civil rights despite their ethnicity.Bob was also a member of the Executive Committee of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. Because of his many achievements and contributions, he was and always will be a role model to the more than eleven million Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent in our country.His presence and driving force will certainly be missed. However, his legacy will live on through the people of Sacramento, the Asian Pacific Islander American community and our Nation as a whole. I offer my deepest condolences to his wife, Doris, son, Brian, daughter-in-law, Amy and granddaughter, Anna. We will miss you, Bob. All Hawaii sends with you on your final journey our deepest and most loving Aloha.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, the sheer weight of logic plus our considerable mutual charm I think has some hope in that direction.Mr. Chairman, I rise today in favor of this amendment. Please allow me to say two things before I proceed. First, I want to express my gratitude to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) and to the gentleman from California (Mr. Pombo) and their committee staffs. Believe me, a lot of work went into this in the midst of all of the other pressures of various other items that were before them. This means a great deal.In every one of these bills, particularly in this energy bill, people have things to which they are deeply committed, including my good friend, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake), with respect to both the philosophy involved and what the consequences might be from any given item.Now, in the great scheme of things, this might not seem like a lot to a lot of people, but for those of us who understand what it is, if we can actually grow our own renewable energy with sugarcane in the form of biomass can actually provide by being converted to ethanol. That is why this is here.I am not certain, and the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case) will speak shortly about it too, as to whether there are larger, logistical issues involved or political issues. But I can tell my colleagues this: Whatever arguments there are out there about whether sufficient time or funds are being committed to renewable energy, alternative energy, this is something that we can do. And this is something where we are getting support from the oil and gas companies in Texas, in Louisiana.Hawaii and Florida can join in, because we are growing sugarcane, sugarcane can become ethanol, ethanol can help reduce the dependency on oil and gas. And we can work with the oil and gas companies to see to it that we have blends that will allow us to reduce our dependency on foreign oil, on foreign sources. That is what this is about.We can grow our own energy in Hawaii if we get the chance to do this. And the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Pombo) have recognized this. They are going to give us the chance, and if this works, I am in contact with people, for example, like at Southern University in Louisiana, just speaking with them tonight, with the idea that perhaps we can take the sugarcane industry, and instead of always having to be in the position of having to defend ourselves against wage slavery around the rest of the world, that we will be able to have good jobs, good income in the United States of America, and be growing our own energy. That is what this is about, and that is why I ask for the support of my colleagues on this.",

I do not think so. You are not saving any money that way. That is not going to work.But I would be happy some other time perhaps to have a full blown discussion about this at another point.Chairman Dreier, Ranking Member Slaughter and the Members of the Committee on Rules. I offer this amendment to H.R. 6 with the hope of reducing our nation's reliance on oil and advancing our efforts in Hawaii to become more energy self- sufficient. This is philosophically consistent with other provisions of H.R. 6 encouraging energy production. My amendment authorizes a 3-year demonstration program for the production of ethanol from sugar cane in Hawaii. Specifically, $8.0 million would fund a $1.00 per gallon payment to refiners and 8.0 million gallons of ethanol fuel. This pilot program would parallel the existing corn program to show that the process can be applicable to cane sugar and can be replicated on a larger scale. Nationally, the sugar cane industry is currently formulating a program to process 700,000 tons of cane sugar into ethanol. With a large domestic surplus of sugar, and the possibility of additional imported sugar being allowed into the domestic market through free trade agreements, a program of such size would stabilize domestic markets and produce a significant volume of ethanol. This pilot project will provide invaluable insight on problems that may arise with a national program. The State of Hawaii has passed a law that goes into effect on April 1, 2006, mandating a 10 percent ethanol blend for gasoline consumption in the state. Oil refineries are building ethanol storage and blending facilities in anticipation of meeting the requirement. Locally produced ethanol would be less expensive than importing the estimated 45 million gallons of ethanol needed to fulfill the 10 percent requirement. Because of the relatively low domestic price of sugar, Hawaii producers for some time been considering and now planning ethanol production from the cane sugar that would otherwise have gone into the domestic sugar market. The State of Hawaii is prepared to take advantage of this within months. However, this amendment is also supported by the other sugar cane growers who would like to identify any problems that might result from the large scale production of sugar cane ethanol. This amendment was developed after the House Energy and Commerce Committee completed its markup but the amendment has been signed off by the majority side of the Energy Committee. I urge my colleagues to allow floor debate on this demonstration project and rule this amendment in order. Thank you very mush for your consideration.Mr. Chairman, I yield my remaining time to the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case).The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Hawaii is recognized for 1\\1/2\\ minutes.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) to recognize May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. As a member of the caucus' executive committee and the chairman of its Immigration Task Force, I want to honor the many achievements and contributions of the more than thirteen million Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent in our country.Back in 1978, my friends and colleagues, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, former Senator Spark Matsunaga, former Representative Frank Horton and former Representative Norm Mineta helped establish the first 10 days of May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Week. Subsequent efforts were made to extend the week-long celebration to a month-long event. In the 102nd Congress, I was an original cosponsor of legislation signed into law that designated May of each year as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.I am blessed to serve the First Congressional District of Hawaii which is comprised primarily of Asian Pacific Americans (APA). It's an inspiring and empowering sight for other APAs from around the country to see. I know I say this every year, but I feel that it needs to be repeated. There is a special strength and resilience embodied in Hawaii's unique cultural mix: we have chosen to be defined by our diversity rather than divided by our differences. That resolve to work together with Aloha can serve as an example to the rest of the country.While we can look at APA Heritage Month as a time to recognize and celebrate many individual accomplishments, we must also take action. My colleagues and I are committed to improving the lives of all APAs by working on issues of importance to our community, such as fighting to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities, defending civil liberties, protecting Social Security, and ensuring educational opportunities for our children. These are the principles that reflect this year's theme, ``Liberty and Freedom for All.''This year's theme represents the past and ongoing contributions of APAs, such as Congresswoman Patsy T. Mink who dedicated her life to economic and social justice, Congressman Robert Matsui, who's internment experience during World War II helped shape his belief that every American is entitled to basic civil rights despite their ethnicity, and Japanese American soldiers who fought during World War II, such as Senator Daniel K. Inouye.Throughout our nation's history, APAs have made and continue to make major contributions in areas such as business, civil liberties, culture and arts, education, medicine, technology and politics. By the year 2050, there will be an estimated 33.4 million U.S. residents who will identify themselves as Asian alone, which will comprise 8 percent of the total population. This is a projected 213 percent increase of APAs between 2000 and 2050. These statistics reflect the growing significance of the APA community, its growing role in the development of public policy, and its cultural contributions that helps us to celebrate our diversities. I extend my heartfelt aloha to the APA community and look forward to celebrating APA Heritage Month.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Arc of Hilo and Lanakila for their hard work and dedication in improving the quality of life for people with developmental or other disabilities in Hawaii. I also want to pay tribute to the many achievements and contributions of Michael Gleason, the Arc of Hilo's executive director, and Marian Tsuji, President/CEO of Lanakila. The Arc of Hilo and Lanakila are a Javits-Wagner-O'Day Program (often referred to as JWOD), which provides job skills and training to those who are blind or who have other severe disabilities so they may earn good wages and benefits and gain a greater independence and the quality of life. Overall, the JWOD program empowers people with disabilities who traditionally face an unemployment rate of 70 percent and rely heavily on social support programs such as welfare and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).The Arc of Hilo's mission is to improve the quality of life for people with developmental and other disabilities in Hawaii through educational, recreational, vocational, and skill training as well as employment and residential opportunities. Lanakila's mission is to offer programs and services for adults with cognitive, physical, social or age-related challenges that build and support higher levels of independence and an improved quality of life. By employing people who are blind or who have other severe disabilities, the Arc of Hilo and Lanakila are able to increase independence and self-esteem by helping these individuals enjoy full participation in their communities and market their JWOD skills to other public/private sector employers.Demonstrating an excellent federal-private sector partnership, NISH, NIB, and local nonprofits such as the Arc of Hilo and Lanakila enhance the opportunities for economic and personal independence of people who are blind or who have other severe disabilities, primarily through creating, sustaining, and improving employment. Through the JWOD program, the Arc of Hilo provides employment opportunities and training for 60 people with visual and other severe disabilities enabling them to lead more productive and meaningful lives, support their families, and gain important work experience.Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the important contributions of the Arc of Hilo and Lanakila in the great aloha state of Hawaii. I commend all persons who are committed to and work towards enhancing employment opportunities for people with visual and other severe disabilities.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield on that point, my intention is not to take up time necessarily on Iraq Watch on the question of H.J. Res. 55, the joint resolution number 55, but that is the tangible substance of the commitment of the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) and others at this point, including myself, to try to put legislation forward that will respond precisely to the commentary that the gentleman from Connecticut found in his West Hartford meeting.The resolution asks the President to develop and implement a plan for the withdrawal of the United States Armed Forces from Iraq. It makes a reference, the short version of it, joint resolution 55, as Homeward Bound. The principal point here, rather than going over it point by point, the principal point in the context established tonight, and I am referring to one of two findings here, is that the United States has in place a timetable for training, equipping and employing Iraqi security forces to take over the counterinsurgency mission from coalition forces. That is a statement of fact.Speaking as a member of the Committee on Armed Services, I can say to you in all candor and openness that we do have timetables. We do have timetables. We do have benchmarks. We do have indications and timelines for those indications of what constitutes success, what constitutes a capacity for the counterinsurgency mission to be taken from coalition forces by Iraqi forces of all kinds; from border police to interior ministry, to defense personnel police and armed forces.In order to explicate that clearly to the American people, this House passed, in overwhelming numbers, an emergency supplemental appropriations for defense, the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense on the global war on terror and tsunami relief. Public Law 109-13. In that, a joint explanatory statement accompanied the conference report, which required the Secretary of Defense to report not later than July 10.As we speak, it is now approximately 8:45 p.m. on the East Coast on July 19, some 9 days past the deadline established by the Congress of the United States, passed by Democrats and Republicans in overwhelming numbers. Not with this Member's vote, to be sure. But nonetheless, my position as enunciated then in opposition to it, to the bill, because I felt we were not carrying forward on what we said we were doing, nonetheless the overwhelming majority gave the Secretary of Defense the opportunity to report to us no later than July 10 and every 90 days thereafter on measures for security, political, and economic progress in Iraq.Mr. Speaker, I received a letter from the Secretary of Defense yesterday indicating they were working hard on this report. I have no doubt. But we are already 9 days late. We are already 9 days of more killings, more murders, more terrorism, more grievous wounding, more terrorism worldwide, and yet we do not have this report from the Secretary of Defense.My plea is that other Members and the audience that may be listening to us tonight take a look at House Joint Resolution 55 that has been developed on a bipartisan basis with one of the leading advocates being the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) and other Members of the Republican Party and Democratic Party as well. This is not an ideological construct, this is not a resolution made to embarrass the President. On the contrary, House Joint Resolution 55 in some respects has been characterized by some as saying what are you doing helping President Bush? We should be in opposition to President Bush, but I feel the politics will take care of itself in time to come. There is no question about that. We can make that point later. This resolution is about backing up our troops now on the mission they have accomplished, and to get the political side, the economic side, the civilian side of this moving forward the way we say it should be.So we set in this resolution the opportunity for the President to enunciate a plan commensurate with the time tables he has set for the establishment of a government in December, and to move forward with the troops that the Secretary of Defense himself has said are being trained so we can begin to withdraw, bring homeward bound our troops.So when people inquire of you what is it Congress is doing, we can look at H.J. Res. 55. It is not perfect. It is a legislative project. The only perfect set of rules, the only perfect legislation was the Ten Commandments, and I understand Moses took 40 days to do them. And as he came down the mountain he said, Well, I got them down to 10. That is what the legislative process is. You talk things over.So House Joint Resolution 55 is not a perfect vehicle, but it is a legislative vehicle to join with the President and make an offer to the President to join with us in the Congress in setting a timetable and plan for the withdrawal of these troops commensurate with the mission as enunciated by everyone.",

    "title": "HAWAII WATER RESOURCES ACT OF 2005",
    "text": "Madame Speaker, I rise today to support, S. 264, the Hawaii Water Resources Act of 2005. This legislation will authorize Federal funds for three urgently needed water projects in the State of Hawaii.Madame Speaker, several years ago our State suffered through 5 years of drought conditions. Due to dangerous drops in our water levels, water usage was restricted to prevent saltwater from entering our pumps. Today, there is no drought and water conservation measures continue to be taught in schools and publicized. However, these three water development projects will make tremendous strides in ensuring a stable water supply for our growing island State and conserve the limited water supplies we do have. Because of the importance of these projects, I introduced the companion measure, H.R. 843, and wholeheartedly support this legislation.H.R. 843/S. 264 would authorize three projects that would help the State of Hawaii implement long-term management plans for our most limited natural resource, fresh water. The Kalaeloa Desalination Project would be built on Oahu, home to 72 percent of the State's population. It is estimated that water use rates on this island will begin exceeding recharge rates in 2018. This problem is particularly evident on the western side of Oahu which has a secondary urban center, Kapolei, which has experienced a population explosion in recent years. Kapolei is a planned community whose population is expected to increase by 70 percent in the next 20 years. The Board of Water Supply for the City and County of Honolulu has successfully implemented conservation measures and special programs which have lowered water consumption. This project would help meet Kapolei's projected demand, conserve limited groundwater, avoid impacts to the environment from wells drilled in forested watersheds, increase system reliability and minimize saltwater intrusion when water levels drop in drought conditions--Oahu experienced a 5-year drought from 1998 to 2002. This facility would also be capable of future expansion, an important aspect for this heavily populated island.The second project is located on the western side of the big island of Hawaii. This area sees very little rainfall and is very similar to the high arid regions of the mainland United States. The Kealakehe Wastewater Treatment Project would utilize wetlands to naturally clean the effluent being discharged by the Kealakehe Wastewater Treatment Plant. Once the effluent water quality is upgraded and the maximum amount of flow diverted for use onsite in the wetlands, a distribution system would then convey the recycled water to potential users. A conventional tertiary treatment system would be cost prohibitive for a facility of this size. Moreover, the discharge of treated water could lead to the degradation of coastal water quality in an area that is known for its beautiful beaches and is a popular tourist destination. This project is an ecologically friendly alternative that would also provide habitat for two endangered bird species which are currently nesting on land adjacent to the Keahole International Airport.The third project that would be authorized is the Lahaina Recycled Water Distribution System Expansion Project located on the island of Maui. Over the last decade, Maui has worked to build a solid foundation for a water recycling program. Currently, it is able to use approximately 25 percent of the recycled water it produces, about 4 million gallons per day. The main impediment to using more recycled water is the lack of infrastructure to distribute the recycled water to the commercial enterprises that could use it. A key example of this problem is in West Maui where recycled water is used to irrigate the Kaanapali Golf Courses. The pipeline that leads to the golf courses also passes a number of other commercial enterprises that are interested in using recycled water but the infrastructure is not adequately developed to allow these properties to connect to the system. Authorizing this project for Federal assistance will allow for expansion at a much faster rate and result in a greater savings of potable water.The State of Hawaii is addressing its problems of limited water and trying to implement solutions. The next time a drought comes, it may be too late to act. This bill will help us protect Hawaii's environment, meet our growing water needs, and maintain our quality of life. I urge my colleagues to support this vitally important measure.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Gerald K. Sumida as he retires after serving nearly 23 years as Program Director of the Hawaii Senior Companion Program (SCP).Gerald's career with the Hawaii state government began in July 1975, where he worked in the then Corrections Division and the Adult Services Unit of the then Department of Social Services and Housing. On March 16, 1983, he began his tenure with SCP and has dedicated his time and compassion in helping improve the lives of our beloved kupuna or elders. Under the direction of Gerald, the SCP and the Respite Companion Service Program (RCSP) have gained the recognition and respectability in the aging community.Through Gerald's guidance the Senior Companion Program has expanded its senior companion services to include Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Molokai, Lanai, and Kauai. Gerald's tireless efforts have provided Hawaii the opportunity to be continually blessed with two federally funded programs providing much needed services to the frail elderly population. Through Gerald's foresight, the SCP and RCSP have continued to improve the quality of life for thousands of frail elderly individuals, and the RCSP has provided hundreds of its participants the opportunity for unsubsidized employment as ``older workers'' in today's workforce.Gerald's gentle and compassionate nature has given many elderly low-income individuals, with limited resources and command of the English language, hope and encouragement to become productive seniors in the community. He will truly be missed at the Hawaii Senior Companion Program, but I believe that he will remain an active member of the community. Mahalo nui loa for all of your hard work, Gerald!

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, this legislation may seem a bit esoteric to some not only in Congress here but in the public at large. But this issue, and I want to commend you and the ranking member for bringing it to our attention, this legislation could not be more crucial in terms of what our national responsibilities are.Boxing and some of the so-called sports that are now associated with physical contact, things called the extreme sports, are interstate in nature, almost by definition. And because they are interstate, without regulation or oversight by the Congress, that means that many of the people associated with, in particular in this instance, the boxers, are in a sense victimized by our failure to take this up as a national question.The stories may be instructive that are associated with boxing and boxing history. They may be even redemptive in terms of our contemplation of them: People struggling up from the bottom of the economic and social scale, sometimes tragic in nature in terms of those that have succeeded, and then are undone by success. For example, it is well known that the great heavyweight challenger Joe Louis Barrow was considered not only a great champion and a great personality, but was associated in many people's minds symbolically with being able to rise above race to be a symbol for brotherhood, someone who sacrificed financially for the United States by joining the Army during the war. And his reward was to be persecuted by the Internal Revenue Service for not paying taxes on purses and funds that he earned during that period of time. As a result, it had tragic dimensions for him in later life.These kinds of stories can be replicated over and over again throughout the history of boxing. So what we have right now is the opportunity, Mr. Chairman, for us to put together a commission that will deal with some of the fundamental issues within the purview of the Congress in terms of interstate regulation.This has to do with health care and the capacity to see to it that anybody engaged in boxing has access to and provision for health care and for pensions for that time when they have to retire. There is no reason why a percentage of every purse cannot be put into some kind of fund that will guarantee a pension and access to a pension for those engaged in boxing.We have had great champions in Hawaii. Everyone has a story in this regard, Stan Harrington and Bobo Olson, some of the folks that I had an opportunity to know, and some of our champions right now, and potential champions in Hawaii and elsewhere across the country. I ask that everyone give us a chance to move this legislation along so we can complete the opportunity that is before us.",

    "title": "ESTABLISHING A MEMORIAL WITHIN KALAUPAPA NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill introduced by my colleague, Representative Ed Case. His bill to establish a memorial within Kalaupapa National Historical Park would serve to honor and perpetuate the memory of those individuals who were forcibly relocated to the Kalaupapa Peninsula from 1866-1969.The sad history of Kalaupapa is well known within the State of Hawaii. Two tragedies occurred on the Kalaupapa Peninsula on the north shore of the island of Moloka`i. The first is the removal of indigenous people in 1865 and 1895. The removal of Hawaiians from where they had lived for 900 years cut the cultural ties and associations of generations of people from the `aina (land).The second tragedy is the forced isolation of sick people to this remote place from 1866 until 1969. The establishment of an isolation settlement, first at Kalawao and then at Kalaupapa, tore apart Hawaiian society as the Kingdom of Hawaii, and subsequently the territory of Hawai`i, tried to control the feared disease of leprosy, now known as Hansen's disease. The impact of broken connections with the `aina and of family members ``lost'' to Kalaupapa are still felt in Hawai`i today.Kalaupapa National Historical Park, established in 1980, contains the physical setting for these stories. Within its boundaries are the historic Hansen's disease settlements of Kalaupapa and Kalawao. The community of Kalaupapa, on the leeward side of Kalaupapa Peninsula, is still home for many surviving Hansen's disease patients, whose memories and experiences are cherished values. In Kalawao on the windward side of the peninsula are the churches of Siloama, established in 1866, and Saint Philomena, associated with the work of Father Damien (Joseph De Veuster), a great humanitarian who gave his life to minister to the physical and spiritual needs of those banished to the settlement.Kalaupapa retains the memories and spirit of all those who lived there. Someday, the last Hansen's disease patient living in Kalaupapa will pass away. A memorial will be a permanent tribute to the brave souls who called Kalaupapa home. I support this legislation and hope my colleagues will also extend their support.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I would like to amplify my formal statement with a few personal observations. The chairman has kindly indicated some of the history of Senator Fong. It is interesting when I look down and see the word Hiram L. Fong, because he is so much of the history of Hawaii, we all think of him as Senator Fong.As has been noted, he was the seventh of 11 children of an immigrant family. If there was ever a story of Hawaii, of our rainbow people and our aloha spirit, it is Hiram Fong. He worked a lot of jobs and worked his way through school and did very, very well. He founded not only a prominent law firm but founded as well what became a financial empire.I have some real interest in it because the very first campaign that I ever ran was funded by Senator Fong's Finance Factors. I went down to get a loan. I thought if I was going to run against him, I thought the least I could do, in the spirit of bipartisanship, was to ask him to help fund my campaign. As a graduate student at the University of Hawaii, I went down to borrow $50. They said we cannot lend you $50, we have to lend you $200 if we are going to make any money on this. So I said, I will take it. I was able to run my very first campaign on Hiram Fong's dime, although I should say nickel, because that is what I passed out in the streets of Honolulu to represent the inflation that I thought we were going to have to deal with in those days. That was an innocent time.Senator Fong was always gracious. Senator Fong was always able to reach out. As has been noted, he was elected as a Republican in a very Democratic State. He was supported in great measure and elected in great measure with the support of labor in Hawaii. Most particularly, the ILWU, the International Longshoremen Workers Union, testifying in favor of the establishment of a commission in 2005, after he passed away, to honor and recognize him as a political, business and community leader testified, ``The Senator was a successful businessman and a Republican who never forgot his humble beginnings. He was a strong supporter of civil rights and often crossed the aisle to cooperate on issues important to Hawaii's unions and workers.''Senator Hiram Fong came to the United States Senate with the arrival of Hawaii as the last State of the Union. Probably nothing could be more fitting than to recognize him today through this legislation and the pioneer effort that he made. Yes, the last State to enter the Union had as its first Senator the son of an immigrant family who came from China looking for opportunity, looking for justice, and found it in the person of their son, and a true son of Hawaii, Hiram Fong.",

    "title": "COMMENDING THE PEOPLE OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS FOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND SACRIFICES THEY MADE TO THE UNITED STATES NUCLEAR TESTING PROGRAM IN THE MARSHALL ISLANDS",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 692, a resolution to commend the people of the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the contributions and grave sacrifices they made to the United States nuclear testing program in the Marshall Islands.In 1947, the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) became one of six entities in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands established by the United Nations with the U.S. as the Trustee. This began a decades-long relationship between the U.S. and RMI that has proven to be resilient and enduring.In particular, I'd like to highlight the U.S. nuclear testing program in RMI which began in 1946. Over the years, the U.S. detonated 67 nuclear weapons on the islands of Bikini and Enewetak. These tests comprise 80 percent of all atmospheric tests conducted by the United States. On March 1, 1954, the hydrogen weapons test code-named ``Bravo'' yielded explosive power approximately 1,000 times greater than the weapon used in the 1945 wartime nuclear attack on Hiroshima, Japan. The Bravo test created a mushroom cloud 25 miles in diameter, produced a crater 6,000 feet in diameter, and vaporized 6 islands at the Bikini Atoll. Radiation from the test forced the evacuation of Marshallese and U.S. military personnel on Rongelap, Rongerik, Utirik and Ailinginae. This responsibility shouldered by the Marshallese people allowed a majority of all tests to be conducted as far from densely populated areas as possible and helped bring about a peaceful end to the Cold War.Over the years, the Marshallese have faced very serious consequences as a result of the nuclear testing. The health and property effects have proved to be extensive and in many cases, immeasurable. The U.S. has recognized this and set up a fund to compensate those affected by the testing. However, the consequences of this testing, especially the health of the Marshallese people, continue to be impacted. In particular, the Section 177 Health Care Program is in urgent need of increased funding. Intended to provide comprehensive medical care, including cancer care, for the four communities most affected by the nuclear weapons testing program, this healthcare program has fallen woefully short of its intended goals. Spending approximately $12 per patient per month, the needs of this program are immediate and urgent.Mr. Speaker, I am sure that our countries will continue to work on this issue and find a resolution. I also have no doubt that the relationship between our governments will continue to be productive and mutually beneficial. As our alliance continues in the coming decades, I urge the United States to step up and meet its obligations to the people of the RMI. With all the sacrifices they have made for the United States and continue to make each day, it is the very least the United States can do.I urge my colleagues to join me in commending the people of the Marshall Islands and acknowledge their profound sacrifices. We must continue our efforts to restore the health and lands of the people of the Marshall Islands.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Hunter and Mr. Skelton for the opportunity. I stand here today in support of the bill moving forward, but I have a caveat that I hope will be able to be addressed before we come to a final conclusion.As the chairman knows, my original opposition was to what has been termed the ``bridge fund''; upon reconsideration, I have become a strong advocate of it. For those not familiar with it, the bridge fund is a legitimate methodology for the authorizing committee to deal with the actual cost of deployments of our Armed Forces throughout the world.Presently, the bridge fund will deal only with approximately 6 months' worth of costs associated, expenditures associated, with these deployments. As a result then we will have to take up yet another supplemental budget, probably just after the first of the year, within a month or so, and that will, in turn, find us dealing with other requests, other emergencies, that will be included in this so-called supplemental budget. It is not an emergency that we need funding for for our deployments overseas, but rather an admission and an acknowledgment of the true costs of these deployments overseas.So, Mr. Chairman, I most certainly urge that we move the bill along and, at the same time, then take up this question of being straightforward and honest with the American people as to what the true costs are of our deployments and to see to it that the military does not have to cannibalize the existing budget and take us away from what I consider 100 percent support of the troops 50 percent of the time.I believe, even though I am in opposition to much of what is the foundation for support, the irony in this is that those like myself who did not support the effort in Iraq as undertaken and have serious reservations about how the war is being conducted, the military action is being conducted in Afghanistan, are actually being sustained in our position; rather than finding support for those who originally were for the war in Iraq or think that we are doing the right thing in Afghanistan, that position is being undermined because we are not being straightforward with people as to what the true costs are.There is a case of unease in the American public, I think, with regard to our present policies in Iraq and Afghanistan because we do not have a straightforward, honest approach with the American people as to what the costs are. I believe the American people will pay any costs to protect our security if they feel that we are being honest and straightforward about it.We need to do that. We need to bring the bridge fund in our authorization up to the actual cost, and not undermine the good work that has been on this bill this year.Mr. Chairman, as the ranking minority member of the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee of the HASC, I am pleased to support H.R. 5122. I also want to commend my chairman and partner on the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee, Congressman Kurt Weldon, for his nonpartisan approach to our subcommittee's portion' of this bill.The procurement and research portions of this bill that the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee oversees strikes an effective balance between getting our troops the equipment they need, ensuring that the equipment works, and ensuring that it is all acquired at a price the Nation can afford. Striking this balance is always difficult, but given the pressure on the DOD budget from the war in Iraq, this was an especially challenging year. I am pleased to support the procurement and research aspects of this bill as a good-government approach to making tough decisions when funds are limited.This bill is a significant improvement over the procurement and research budget presented by the President in two critical ways. First, it is a more straightforward document that lays out what the committee decided the military's priorities should be, and what funding these priorities will actually cost. Second, it shifts funding from programs that are simply not working and moves those funds to programs that are working and are delivering effective equipment to the troops in the field today. With troops in combat the Congress has a non-negotiable obligation to weigh in heavily on the side of immediate and near-term needs of the military.There are two programs that this bill takes some significant funding away from, and I want to address the committee's reasoning on these reductions, because they were both difficult decisions. The first is the Army's Future Combat System, which this bill cuts by $325 million.I want to be clear that this is not a move to punish the Army. Everyone on this committee recognizes that the Army is carrying the heaviest burden in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in terms lives lost and dollars spent. Every member of this committee also wants to ensure we have an Army that is ready today and prepared for the challenges of the future. The problem is that the Army simply has too many bills to pay and not enough funding to cover all of them. Difficult choices had to be made.The second program cut is to the VH-71 ``Presidential Helicopter'' program. This rather modest cut is based on the committee's concern that this program is being pushed too fast and is taking test and development risks that are clearly not appropriate and could be outright dangerous. I want to make it absolutely clear that the goal of this cut and some language in the bill is not to kill the program, or even scale back its size. Instead, it is a reflection of this committee's support for the principle of ``fly before you buy'' that must be followed, especially for a helicopter the President of the United States is going to fly in.Given the demands of an ongoing war and the need to continue to buy and develop new equipment, this bill strikes an appropriate balance given the funding available.Despite my support for the bill, I did want to caveat that support in one important aspect: the lack of an authorization in this bill for the full-year cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.In each of the past two years, the Congress has put some of the funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through the normal authorization and appropriations process. The rest of the funding for the year, however, has come through very large supplemental appropriations bills that the Armed Services Committee has been unable to oversee properly.I have supported all of the Defense authorization and Defense Appropriations bills done under our normal budget procedures since the war in Iraq began. Putting the money in the normal budget would be best, but the ``bridge fund'' mechanism in the legislation before us today is arguably a reasonable middle ground between funding purely through supplementals and the normal budget process. Chairman Hunter deserves credit for coming up with this more honest approach.This year, for whatever reason, the Administration only requested $50 billion in additional funding in FY 2007 for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This total is reflected in the bill as reported by the committee. During committee consideration of this bill, I had an amendment that sought to increase the amount of the bridge fund to $92 billion so that it would reflect the likely full-year cost of combat operations overseas. Unfortunately this amendment was voted down by the majority.Having a more realistic full-year figure in this bill would have improved this legislation's relevance and honesty. The troops overseas and the American people deserve to know what our best estimate of the cost of these wars will be in 2007.Continuing to rely on massive supplemental, so-called ``emergency'' spending bills to pay for the war is both dishonest and fiscally unsound. I believe that the American people are willing to sacrifice to get the troops the funds they need, but instead of asking all Americans to sacrifice we are instead using a budget shell game to hide the real cost of the war. This shell game also allows massive tax cuts for the wealthy during a war which we are borrowing money from other nations to pay for. Funding the war in this manner is saddling our children and grandchildren with a massive debt that they will have to payoff in the future.Overall, the bill before us today is a good bill, but choosing to only authorize 6 months of funding for the troops in the field is like saying to them that the Congress supports you 100 percent for 50 percent of the year. I do not think that is the message that the House wants to send.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, it is clear that the principal issue that is going to be before us as we deal with the overall bill is going to be the lifting of the moratorium, the congressional moratorium with respect to drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf.As a supporter of a bill that Mr. Peterson and I hoped to have heard in the Resources Committee that will deal with the issue in a much broader scope, I hope I can bring some level of reality here to what this is all about.Mr. Chairman, it is the quite true, as has been mentioned by previous speakers who want to see this amendment taken out of the overall bill, that 25 years ago the question of drilling 3 miles off of Florida or California or anywhere was an issue, and the reason that the moratorium was put in was to prevent that from happening. But that was 25 years ago, and now the issue is up for reconsideration, not to drill 3 miles, but whether there is going to be any drilling at all and whether it should take place and under what circumstances, given what has happened over the past 25 years.The reason the Peterson amendment is in the overall bill is to give us the opportunity to start that discussion. There will be no drilling off of Florida or anyplace else if we pass this bill. It just gives us the opportunity to begin a discussion as to whether we should reconsider that position and where it should happen. That is what is at issue here, lifting the congressional moratorium. There is still a Presidential moratorium against it; there is still a 5-year plan that has to be implemented. We need to consider whether we want to continue with that particular approach.So what we are asking for is every Member here to be able to vote his or her own views on whether we can have a discussion on this issue. Our problem, Mr. Chairman, is, particularly for those of us who are Democrats, that we are in the grip now of an assault by an environmental Taliban out there that has absolute revealed wisdom as to what is involved with us trying to achieve an independent energy source that we can have as an alternative energy source right now in our country, and not be in the grip of people around the world who wish us ill with regard to energy.All we are asking for is the opportunity to be able to discuss this issue. If we defeat the Peterson amendment or have it taken out and pass the Capps-Putnam amendment and whatever other amendments are associated with it, we won't have the chance to even begin a discussion about whether natural gas is an alternative independent source of energy that we need to have now.That is what our request is. Let us have this discussion. Keep the Peterson amendment in the bill so we can begin the discussion and have the hearings that Mr. Davis and others indicated they would like to have. I agree with them. I think Members know me for a long time, I would never try to embarrass somebody else or put somebody else in a position of saying, look, I am right and you are wrong and I have the only position possible. That is not what it is about. We need to have this discussion. Let us defeat the Capps-Putnam amendment so that we can have this discussion. Mr. Chairman, I hope that everybody understands this is not a Democratic-Republican issue; this is an American issue about independent energy resources for this Nation.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support Congressman Melancon's motion to instruct conferees on H.R. 2864. This motion would direct conferees to accept provisions that will protect coastal communities in Louisiana and Mississippi from the storm surge of a category 5 hurricane.Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf on August 29, 2005, and was a category 3 hurricane that did not even directly hit the affected areas.Yet, Katrina was able to inflict monstrous and unimaginable damage upon Louisiana and the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. One year after Hurricane Katrina, the area remains a terrible, twisted portrait of lives and families and whole communities washed away; home by home, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood.As a result of Hurricane Katrina:More than 1,000 people died.The total number of immediately displaced people has never been determined. Estimates range from the hundreds of thousands to the millions.The Louisiana parishes of Orleans and St. Bernard were especially hard hit by flooding, with an estimated 77% of Orleans's population affected, and nearly all residents of St. Bernard.In Mississippi, 55% of Hancock County's population is estimated to have been affected by flooding and/or structural damage.In the greater New Orleans area alone, there were 160,000 homes and apartments destroyed or heavily damaged by the storm.The metro New Orleans area has lost approximately 400,000 residents.The National Flood Insurance Program has paid out $17 billion in property damage claims in Louisiana alone, only a fraction of total damage.Hospital capacity in Orleans parish dropped in half immediately after the storm. In St. Bernard, there are still no hospitals open.The Army Corps of Engineers has only begun to raise sinking levees and deal with unfinished hurricane protection and flood prevention projects. But, they're only rebuilding the levees to withstand a Category 3 storm, Katrina's level. Prudent planning and common sense would dictate that they be raised to Category 5 levels to protect the more than two million residents along these coasts.I urge my colleagues to support and vote for this motion to instruct.",

    "title": "INTRODUCING THE HAWAIIAN HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2006",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of legislation I am proud to introduce today. The Hawaiian Homeownership Opportunity Act of 2006 is the exact same language of HR 5851, reported out of the House Financial Services Committee on September 28, 2006.The measure reauthorizes existing Native Hawaiian housing programs for five years and makes two adjustments to the program that will allow the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands to help more Native Hawaiians whose incomes are equal to or less than 80 percent of the median income.In 2000 Congress passed legislation authorizing the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide block grants for affordable housing for Native Hawaiians through the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. The 2000 measure also authorized HUD home loan guarantees for low-income Native Hawaiians. Eligible borrowers include Native Hawaiian families, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, and private nonprofit organizations experienced in planning and developing affordable housing for Native Hawaiians.The Hawaiian Home Ownership Opportunity Act of 2006 reauthorizes these programs and adds a new provision authorizing loan guarantees for home mortgage refinancing. This introduces greater flexibility and allows families to take advantage of lower interest rates as millions of other American families have. The measure would also permit the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands to issue bonds. This will allow the Department to service more low-income families without a large increase in appropriations.This bill is about homeownership, this is not welfare or public assistance. It offers another tool for a family to provide for a basic need, housing. This is unbelieveably important in Hawaii where land is scarce and the median home price on the island of Oahu is $639,000 and the median condominium price is $310,000. This measure will advance our efforts to address housing affordability in the islands.I would like to thank the House Financial Services Committee, in particular Chairman Mike Oxley and Ranking Member Barney Frank, who have been extremely supportive in dealing with the housing problems of Hawaii. I would also like to recognize my colleague from Hawaii, Congressman Ed Case, who, like Chairman Oxley and Ranking Member Frank, is a cosponsor of this legislation.I urge my colleagues to help the residents of Hawaii and support this legislation.",

    "title": "JOHN WARNER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2007",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this year's National Defense Authorization Act. It includes many provisions that are vital to giving our military the tools it needs to defend the nation, although it also leaves much work undone that will have to be addressed in the future.The bill addresses one issue in particular that merits attention. Despite the Pentagon's repeated denials of a military readiness crisis, this bill authorizes an additional $23 billion in funding as a downpayment on the damage to the U.S. Army and Marine Corps from repeated and sustained deployments to Iraq, and the Bush Administration's decision to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through a parade of emergency supplemental appropriations. The wars themselves are wearing down our equipment at a tremendous rate. Further damage is done by supplemental appropriations because the military services are denied the funding they need in a timely and predictable fashion. These two factors are doing serious and longterm damage to the nation's military readiness, and the Congress must address them.During Armed Services Committee deliberations on this bill in March 2006, I offered an amendment to add $42 billion for this reason. Sadly, that amendment was voted down on a party-line vote. I offered the amendment because we had a growing readiness problem and because I thought putting as much of the funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as possible into the base budget was the most honest and effective way to proceed. My approach ended up in the final version of this bill. The $23 billion in this year's bill is a good start, but this funding will have to be sustained in many subsequent bills to address the readiness crisis we continue to face.I am also pleased that this bill includes many important legislative provisions that directly improve the lives of the people of my district and my state. First, it takes the first step toward dealing with the chemical munitions dumped off the coast of Hawaii in the 1940s. These weapons could still pose a serious health and environmental risk, and Section 314 of this bill requires a comprehensive research effort by the military to identify, analyze, and assess the potential threat these sites may pose.Section 2843 of this bill addresses a major land transfer issue in Hawaii regarding the former Barbers Point Naval Air Station. Affordable housing for the people of Hawaii and a new public transit system are critical local issues. This language requires the Navy to turn over an important parcel of land that will allow both new housing and transit development. Balancing the needs of the military and the local population in Hawaii is a challenge, but in this case, I think an arrangement was reached that helps both sides accomplish their goals. I want to thank Chairman Hunter and Chairman Hefley for working with me on this language.Lastly, Section 343 of the bill requires an analysis by the Army of its future live-fire training infrastructure needs in Hawaii. The Army's presence in Hawaii is undergoing tremendous change. A new Stryker Brigade is due to be activated this coming year, and thousands more troops will be coming to Hawaii as part of the larger changes in the military's Pacific region basing posture. Supporting these growing needs while accommodating the cultural, environmental and quality of life concerns of the people of Hawaii is essential. This report will help Congress understand where the Army wants to go in Hawaii with its training infrastructure, and how to get there. In particular, it will address the sensitive issue of the Army's long-term future in the Makua Valley, an area of Hawaii owned by the people of Hawaii and on temporary loan to the military. Eventually, this land must be returned, so the report requires the Army to look beyond its current use of the Makua Valley toward the eventual return of this historic and environmentally sensitive treasure to the people of Hawaii.There are critical quality of life issues that were not resolved. Specifically, it does not do enough to help military families who need the Survivor Benefit Program and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation offset repealed. For me, this is a basic issue of fairness that must be addressed at some point in the future. The bill does not do enough to protect TRICARE health insurance patients from skyrocketing prescription drug prices. The Department of Defense asked for legislative authority to negotiate lower prices with major drug companies. The majority was unwilling to let this provision into the final bill. Finally, the bill before us only provides a 2.2 percent pay raise for the military in 2007. This is meager thanks for our men and women in uniform in a time of war; for those who are experiencing sustained and repeated deployments and absences from their families.As well, this raise is simply too small to help our military families keep up with rising cost of living expenses at many bases around the nation, and especially in Hawaii. We have asked a lot from these men and women. We owe them more in return.I want to now turn to the portion of the bill that falls under the jurisdiction of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee, on which I am proud to serve as the ranking minority member. This year, the subcommittee had a daunting task: to reconcile a budget submission that was simply unrealistic in some respects when compared to the needs of the military both today and in the future.Our military is clearly being pulled in many directions at once. Today our forces are fighting unconventional wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the demands of which, in terms of equipment, are very different from possible future conventional conflicts. The U.S. military has to be able to fight and win both types of wars, but there is clearly not enough funding for doing everything the services want to do.This bill authorizes critical short-term needs such as modernization of Army equipment in combat today and increased production of aircraft like the C-17 that are absolutely vital to current military operations. The bill also looks to the future in continuing successful aviation and ground systems. Finally, it takes funding from a few programs that are off-track or not working and moves that funding to more pressing needs, ensuring that taxpayer dollars are not wasted.It also demands additional analysis and testing of systems in development that the subcommittee has concerns about. These provisions may discomfort some people at the Pentagon, but it is Congress' duty to oversee these programs and ensure that the troops get what they need.Overall, this year I think the subcommittee did an excellent job. I especially want to commend Chairman Weldon on his leadership of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee. His willingness to work in an open and nonpartisan manner greatly facilitates the subcommittee's work and produces a better product for our troops and the civilians who serve the nation at the Department of Defense.Finally, another member of this committee deserves special recognition. I worked for many years with Joel Hefley on the Armed Services Committee. He is a both a valued colleague and a close friend. Among his many accomplishments during his distinguished career on this committee, he helped shepherd through one of the most important changes in military housing construction in decades. His vision for leveraging private investment dollars into a massive new program to rebuild and rehabilitate military family housing is now a reality. In my state alone almost ten thousand military homes will be upgraded in the next few years. This housing is a vital part of keeping an all-volunteer military ready, and Joel Hefley was a leader in this revolutionary program. I was and am grateful for the opportunity afforded to me to partner with him in accomplishing passage and implementation of this key legislation enhancing the quality of life of our fighting men and women.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize November's celebration of National Epilepsy Awareness Month.Almost 3 million Americans have epilepsy, a neurological condition that makes people susceptible to seizures. Ten percent of Americans will experience a seizure in their lifetime, and each year, more than 181,000 develop seizures and epilepsy for the first time. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, races, and ethnic backgrounds. The condition can develop at any age, but epilepsy most often occurs in early childhood and old age.It is also important to note that ten percent of all injuries to U.S. soldiers in Iraq are head injuries. Severe head injuries like those incurred during battle and roadside bombings carry a high risk of seizures and epilepsy that, in many cases, can develop months after the initial trauma.Although advances in medical treatment have allowed some individuals with epilepsy to control their illness, more than 40 percent still have persistent seizures, despite all available treatments today. Epilepsy remains a formidable barrier to normal life, affecting educational opportunities, employment, and personal fulfillment.Furthermore, epilepsy continues to be poorly understood by many Americans. Individuals with epilepsy are often misdiagnosed, cannot access the specialists they need, or are the subject of discrimination and prejudice. This cannot continue.National Epilepsy Awareness Month aims to dispel common myths about individuals with epilepsy, increase public awareness and understanding about this serious condition, improve education to ensure faster diagnosis and treatment, and inform people about the services and informational resources available nationwide.Many years ago, my life was turned upside down. Something was wrong with me but my doctor could not identify the cause. Finally, I was diagnosed with epilepsy. This diagnosis brought many challenges, but in my current position as a legislator, it has also brought opportunity. I hope I can be of some influence in directing attention and research to a disorder that has been ignored and misunderstood for too long.Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of Congress to join all Americans with epilepsy, their families, friends, and supporters to do all we can to improve the lives of individuals with epilepsy.",

We have no opportunity, even though we pleaded with the Rules Committee to give us an opportunity to be able to speak on alternatives to this resolution.You have heard that this resolution is in support of the troops. It is not. You have heard that this resolution is in support of the war on terrorism. It is not. And I will tell you why it is not, and I will tell you why we have to have an alternative and why we need to vote ``no'' on this resolution, because it doesn't support the troops, and it does not support the war on terrorism.The people in this resolution that are referred to, the honored sacrifice that has been made by the Armed Forces of the United States, is supposedly on behalf of somebody called Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, a man who today said he was going to engage in conversations with terrorists who have murdered Americans to give them amnesty. This is the amnesty resolution.To vote for this resolution is to vote for those who support amnesty for those who kill American troops. This is the government we are supposed to be standing up and defending, the very freedom that gives that prime minister the possibility of speaking to the terrorists has been won by the blood and sacrifice of American troops. This is the amnesty bill. This is the amnesty resolution.There are people on this floor who will not grant amnesty to people who cut their lawns, who wash the dishes in the restaurants they eat in; but they are willing to vote for a resolution that says that they support a government that is willing to give amnesty to people who murder the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States.I am not going to do that. And if you disagree with that interpretation, give me the right to put it on the floor for a vote and let's see who wins the hearts and minds of the American people, not the Iraqi people, as to who is really supporting the troops and who is really willing to fight a war on terror.This is nothing but a resolution confirming the existing administration policies. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, you deserve the opportunity on the floor of the people's House to have a real debate, not a discussion, not to echo sentiments, but to have substantive words on the floor that allow the American people to understand what direction do we want to take this country.",

And as with many other things in our lives, sometimes your virtues are also your vices, so I understand that very, very well.My request is that you think perhaps about withdrawing this amendment. It is not to argue with you about your premises. Believe me, Mr. Flake, I don't do that. I understand exactly what you are saying, and I understand your concerns with regard to whether or not there are full and complete understandings of what we are doing and why we are doing it under the general aegis of earmarks. My point is that this particular designation has had thorough, and I assure you nonpartisan, thorough, complete briefings and hearings. That is the way our subcommittee works on Armed Services. I assure you of that.Again, as I say, everybody's virtue is also their vice; but let me tell you, if it is a vice to go into exquisite detail as to what you are dealing with, then Mr. Weldon, and I guess by extension myself, is guilty of that.I can assure you that if there is an argument on the floor against what we want to do with rotorcraft innovation in research, then I could understand why you wouldn't want to vote for it. But I can assure every Member here, Republican and Democrat alike, that in the Armed Services Subcommittee, on which I am privileged to serve with Mr. Weldon, that we go into the details of what we are doing and why we are doing it.The final point here. The reason that I support this and the reason Mr. Weldon recommended it to the subcommittee and that he succeeded is that the big companies, the big companies don't do the innovation and the research. They really don't.Mr. Hunter in particular, and, again, I have had my differences with Mr. Hunter, but Mr. Young recognizes and Mr. Hunter recognizes that true innovation in this country comes from the small companies. It comes from the research areas that don't necessarily get the big contracts, nor are they sought out by the big companies. They are like the Titanic. They go right down there. And they can be told there's an iceberg, but, boy, they head there anyway by kinetic energy.I can assure you, Mr. Flake, if you would at least consider withdrawing the amendment, this is one time when the research has been done, the background has been done, the hearings have been held, and we are trying to support the true innovative research side with regard to rotorcraft that might not otherwise get the attention that it deserves and what we need to have for our Armed Forces.I can assure you that the ideological content or premise that forms the philosophy upon which you are making these inquiries I have no argument with, and I give you credit for standing up. It is not easy to stand up against the tide coming at you. It is a lot easier to vote against you and walk off and claim victory. I don't do that. I don't take any shots like that at you. I respect you and I understand what you are doing and why you are doing it. But in this instance, my request to you as a ranking member on this subcommittee is that you consider whether or not this might be an instance in which the House is well served and the Nation is well served by its adoption as recommended by the Appropriations Committee.I thank you for your kind attention.",

I would rather talk about what the bill does do, rather than what its inadequacies might be.I got started in this bill because of my response to the arguments made by Mr. Peterson in committee. We pay attention in committee. Committee hearings and briefings are what gives us the opportunity to educate ourselves, and that is where I came to the table.I didn't know enough about this issue, and I learned about it. What I discovered was, particularly where natural gas was concerned, that we needed to have it. Natural gas is the alternative energy available to us now. It is the bridge to the alternative energy future that we want.None of us are opposing any of the alternatives that have been put forward today. We are saying we have to get there. In order to do that, we have to recognize that lifting the moratorium on the Outer Continental Shelf is the way to do it. It can be done safely. It can be done responsibly.Issues have been made about revenue. You can't get any revenue when you don't have it coming in; 100 percent of nothing is nothing. Arguing about where the revenue is going to go, whether it is the States in some formula, whether it comes back to the Federal Government, as the Congressional Budget Office now argues the bill does, is something that we can address in time to come when this bill leaves the House and goes to the Senate and hopefully comes back for a conference.No one is dismissing any of the legitimate concerns that have been made by those who are now in opposition to the bill. We can take all those issues up.We have labor support now. Construction trades are for the bill, because we are going to create jobs.When we talk about revenue, numbers have been tossed around and up to today as high as $600 billion. That money is leaving the United States. That money is not here for investment in jobs in the future of our country.If that is in fact what is at stake, if those billions of dollars are at stake, let us put it together in a manner that keeps jobs and that money in this country. Let's seek energy independence in this Nation. The time for natural gas exploration and extrication of energy resources in the Outer Continental Shelf has come. Simply to cite 25 years of saying no, no, no does not solve our problem.So I ask those who have some reservations about today's bill, move this bill forward. We will take up all the considerations that you have raised. Let's move to energy independence in this Nation. Let's move to a time when we can say that we met the responsibilities of our time.",

One hundred percent of nothing is nothing. There are no revenues coming in. All of these figures that are being bandied about as if we are losing something, we are not losing anything except energy independence in this country.Now we have reached out to everybody that we wanted to speak to and who has wanted to be honest with us about what we are talking about here today.We are losing jobs by the thousands. Why do you think that American labor is on our side in this? We are losing our petrochemical industries. We are losing our manufacturing base. We are losing our ability to farm, while rich, elite people in this country that support some of these environmental Taliban organizations are out there with the propaganda that is trying to say that some of us that are trying to get to energy independence are the ones that are causing the difficulty.Well, let me tell you something. We are not going to back off on this, and we are not going to listen to lies about revenue and distortions about revenue.

    "title": "THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT OF 2007",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce a bill which is a companion measure to legislation introduced by Senator Daniel Akaka in the Senate this morning. This measure is called the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007. The purpose of the bill is to provide a process for the reorganization of the Native Hawaiian governing entity for the purposes of a federally recognized government-to-government relationship.On this day 114 years ago, the monarchy of the Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown by agents of the United States. This injustice created wounds and issues that have never been healed or resolved. Fourteen years ago, the United States government took a step toward reconciling this part of history by passing a resolution which acknowledged the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and offered an apology to Native Hawaiians.The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act would take another step in the reconciliation process by providing Native Hawaiians the same right of self-governance and self-determination that are afforded to other indigenous peoples. Since Hawaii was annexed as a territory, the United States has treated Native Hawaiians in a manner similar to that of American Indians and Alaska Natives. This bill would formalize that relationship and establish parity in federal policies towards all of our indigenous peoples.This bill will also provide a structured process to address the longstanding issues resulting from the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. This discussion has been avoided for far too long because no one has known how to address or deal with the emotions that arise when these matters are discussed. There has been no structured process. Instead, there has been fear as to what the discussion would entail, causing people to avoid the issues. Such behavior has led to high levels of anger and frustration, as well as misunderstandings between Native Hawaiians and non-Native Hawaiians.The bill provides a structured process to negotiate and resolve these issues with the federal and state governments and will alleviate the growing mistrust, misunderstanding, anger, and frustration about these matters.This measure is supported by Hawaii's Governor, Linda Lingle, Hawaii's Congressional delegation, and the Hawaii State Legislature. The bill is also supported by a number of organizations in Hawaii who have passed resolutions in support of enacting this bill.I ask my colleagues to support this measure and advance the reconciliation process for our people.",

    "title": "INTRODUCING THE HAWAIIAN HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2007",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise in support of legislation I am proud to introduce today. The Hawaiian Homeownership Opportunity Act of 2007 is the exact same language of H.R. 5851, reported out of the House Financial Services Committee on September 28, 2006, in the 109th Congress.The measure reauthorizes existing Native Hawaiian housing programs for 5 years and makes two adjustments to the program that will allow the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands to help more Native Hawaiians whose incomes are equal to or less than 80 percent of the median income.In 2000 Congress passed legislation authorizing the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, to provide block grants for affordable housing for Native Hawaiians through the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. The 2000 measure also authorized HUD home loan guarantees for low-income Native Hawaiians. Eligible borrowers include Native Hawaiian families, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, and private nonprofit organizations experienced in planning and developing affordable housing for Native Hawaiians.The Hawaiian Home Ownership Opportunity Act of 2007 reauthorizes these programs and adds a new provision authorizing loan guarantees for home mortgage refinancing. This introduces greater flexibility and allows families to take advantage of lower interest rates as millions of other American families have. The measure would also permit the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands to issue bonds. This will allow the Department to service more low-income families without a large increase in appropriations.This bill is about homeownership; this is not welfare or public assistance. It offers another tool for a family to provide for a basic need, housing. This is unbelieveably important in Hawaii where land is scarce and the median home price on the island of Oahu is $639,000 and the median condominium price is $310,000. This measure will advance our efforts to address housing affordability in the islands.I would like to thank the House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank and Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity Chairwoman Maxine Waters who have been extremely supportive in dealing with the housing problems of Hawaii. I would also like to recognize my colleague from Hawaii, Congresswoman Mazie Hirono, who, like Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Waters, is a cosponsor of this legislation.I urge my colleagues to help the residents of Hawaii and support this legislation.",

    "title": "FORGETTING THE LESSONS OF HISTORY",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, the following 1984 speech by former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger provides an important perspective on the use of military force in Iraq.Thank you for inviting me to be here today with the members of the National Press Club, a group most important to our national security. I say that because a major point I intend to make in my remarks today is that the single most critical element of a successful democracy is a strong consensus of support and agreement for our basic purposes. Policies formed without a clear understanding of what we hope to achieve will never work. And you help to build that understanding among our citizens. Of all the many policies our citizens deserve and need to understand, none is so important as those related to our topic today the uses of military power. Deterrence will work only if the Soviets understand our firm commitment to keeping the peace, . . . and only from a well-informed public can we expect to have that national will and commitment. So today, I want to discuss with you perhaps the most important question concerning keeping the peace. Under what circumstances, and by what means, does a great democracy such as ours reach the painful decision that the use of military force is necessary to protect our interests or to carry out our national policy? National power has many components, some tangible, like economic wealth, technical pre-eminence. Other components are intangible such as moral force, or strong national will. Military forces, when they are strong and ready and modern, are a credible and tangible addition to a nation's power. When both the intangible national will and those forces are forged into one instrument, national power becomes effective. In today's world, the line between peace and war is less clearly drawn than at any time in our history. When George Washington, in his farewell address, warned us, as a new democracy, to avoid foreign entanglements, Europe then lay 2- 3 months by sea over the horizon. The United States was protected by the width of the oceans. Now in this nuclear age, we measure time in minutes rather than months. Aware of the consequences of any misstep, yet convinced of the precious worth of the freedom we enjoy, we seek to avoid conflict, while maintaining strong defenses. Our policy has always been to work hard for peace, but to be prepared if war comes. Yet, so blurred have the lines become between open conflict and half-hidden hostile acts that we cannot confidently predict where, or when, or how, or from what direction aggression may arrive. We must be prepared, at any moment, to meet threats ranging in intensity from isolated terrorist acts, to guerrilla action, to full-scale military confrontation. Alexander Hamilton, writing in the Federalist Papers, said that it is impossible to foresee or define the extent and variety of national exigencies, or the correspondent extent and variety of the means, which may be necessary to satisfy them. If it was true then, how much more true it is today, when we must remain ready to consider the means to meet such serious indirect challenges to the peace as proxy wars and individual terrorist action. And how much more important is it now, considering the consequences of failing to deter conflict at the lowest level possible. While the use of military force to defend territory has never been questioned when a democracy has been attacked and its very survival threatened, most democracies have rejected the unilateral aggressive use of force to invade, conquer or subjugate other nations. The extent to which the use of force is acceptable remains unresolved for the host of other situations which fall between these extremes of defensive and aggressive use of force. We find ourselves, then, face to face with a modern paradox: The most likely challenge to the peace--the gray area conflicts--are precisely the most difficult challenges to which a democracy must respond. Yet, while the source and nature of today's challenges are uncertain, our response must be clear and understandable. Unless we are certain that force is essential, we run the risk of inadequate national will to apply the resources needed. Because we face a spectrum of threats from covert aggression, terrorism, and subversion, to overt intimidation, to use of brute force, choosing the appropriate level of our response is difficult. Flexible response does not mean just any response is appropriate. But once a decision to employ some degree of force has been made, and the purpose clarified, our government must have the clear mandate to carry out, and continue to carry out, that decision until the purpose has been achieved. That, too, has been difficult to accomplish. The issue of which branch of government has authority to define that mandate and make decisions on using force is now being strongly contended. Beginning in the 1970s Congress demanded, and assumed, a far more active role in the making of foreign policy and in the decision-making process for the employment of military forces abroad than had been thought appropriate and practical before. As a result, the centrality of decision-making authority in the Executive branch has been compromised by the Legislative branch to an extent that actively interferes with that process. At the same time, there has not been a corresponding acceptance of responsibility by Congress for the outcome of decisions concerning the employment of military forces. Yet the outcome of decisions on whether and when and to what degree to use combat forces abroad has never been more important than it is today. While we do not seek to deter or settle all the world's conflicts, we must recognize that, as a major power, our responsibilities and interests are now of such scope that there are few troubled areas we can afford to ignore. So we must be prepared to deal with a range of possibilities, a spectrum of crises, from local insurgency to global conflict. We prefer, of course, to limit any conflict in its early stages, to contain and control it but to do that our military forces must be deployed in a timely manner, and be fully supported and prepared before they are engaged, because many of those difficult decisions must be made extremely quickly. Some on the national scene think they can always avoid making tough decisions. Some reject entirely the question of whether any force can ever be used abroad. They want to avoid grappling with a complex issue because, despite clever rhetoric disguising their purpose, these people are in fact advocating a return to post-World War I isolationism. While they may maintain in principle that military force has a role in foreign policy, they are never willing to name the circumstance or the place where it would apply. On the other side, some theorists argue that military force can be brought to bear in any crisis. Some of these proponents of force are eager to advocate its use even in limited amounts simply because they believe that if there are American forces of any size present they will somehow solve the problem. Neither of these two extremes offers us any lasting or satisfactory solutions. The first undue reserve would lead us ultimately to withdraw from international events that require free nations to defend their interests from the aggressive use of force. We would be abdicating our responsibilities as the leader of the free world responsibilities more or less thrust upon us in the aftermath of World War II war incidentally that isolationism did nothing to deter. These are responsibilities we must fulfill unless we desire the Soviet Union to keep expanding its influence unchecked throughout the world. In an international system based on mutual interdependence among nations, and alliances between friends, stark isolationism quickly would lead to a far more dangerous situation for the United States: we would be without allies and faced by many hostile or indifferent nations. The second alternative employing our forces almost indiscriminately and as a regular and customary part of our diplomatic efforts would surely plunge us headlong into the sort of domestic turmoil we experienced during the Vietnam war, without accomplishing the goal for which we committed our forces. Such policies might very well tear at the fabric of our society, endangering the single most critical element of a successful democracy: a strong consensus of support and agreement for our basic purposes. Policies formed without a clear understanding of what we hope to achieve would also earn us the scorn of our troops, who would have an understandable opposition to being used in every sense of the word casually and without intent to support them fully. Ultimately this course would reduce their morale and their effectiveness for engagements we must win. And if the military were to distrust its civilian leadership, recruitment would fall off and I fear an end to the all- volunteer system would be upon us, requiring a return to a draft, sowing the seeds of riot and discontent that so wracked the country in the '60s. We have now restored high morale and pride in the uniform throughout the services. The all-volunteer system is working spectacularly well. Are we willing to forfeit what we have fought so hard to regain? In maintaining our progress in strengthening America's military deterrent, we face difficult challenges. For we have entered an era where the dividing lines between peace and war are less clearly drawn, the identity of the foe is much less clear. In World Wars I and II, we not only knew who our enemies were, but we shared a clear sense of why the principles espoused by our enemies were unworthy. Since these two wars threatened our very survival as a free nation and the survival of our allies, they were total wars, involving every aspect of our society. All our means of production, all our resources were devoted to winning. Our policies had the unqualified support of the great majority of our people. Indeed, World Wars I and II ended with the unconditional surrender of our enemies. . . . The only acceptable ending when the alternative was the loss of our freedom. But in the aftermath of the Second World War, we encountered a more subtle form of warfare warfare in which, more often than not, the face of the enemy was masked. Territorial expansionism could be carried out indirectly by proxy powers, using surrogate forces aided and advised from afar. Some conflicts occurred under the name of ``national liberation,'' but far more frequently ideology or religion provided the spark to the tinder. Our adversaries can also take advantage of our open society, and our freedom of speech and opinion to use alarming rhetoric and disinformation to divide and disrupt our unity of purpose. While they would never dare to allow such freedoms to their own people, they are quick to exploit ours by conducting simultaneous military and propaganda campaigns to achieve their ends. They realize that if they can divide our national will at home, it will not be necessary to defeat our forces abroad. So by presenting issues in bellicose terms, they aim to intimidate western leaders and citizens, encouraging us to adopt conciliatory positions to their advantage. Meanwhile they remain sheltered from the force of public opinion in their countries, because public opinion there is simply prohibited and does not exist. Our freedom presents both a challenge and an opportunity. It is true that until democratic nations have the support of the people, they are inevitably at a disadvantage in a conflict. But when they do have that support they cannot be defeated. For democracies have the power to send a compelling message to friend and foe alike by the vote of their citizens. And the American people have sent such a signal by re-electing a strong Chief Executive. They know that President Reagan is willing to accept the responsibility for his actions and is able to lead us through these complex times by insisting that we regain both our military and our economic strength. In today's world where minutes count, such decisive leadership is more important than ever before. Regardless of whether conflicts are limited, or threats are ill defined, we must be capable of quickly determining that the threats and conflicts either do or do not affect the vital interests of the United States and our allies. . . . And then responding appropriately. Those threats may not entail an immediate, direct attack on our territory, and our response may not necessarily require the immediate or direct defense of our homeland. But when our vital national interests and those of our allies are at stake, we cannot ignore our safety, or forsake our allies. At the same time, recent history has proven that we cannot assume unilaterally the role of the world's defender. We have learned that there are limits to how much of our spirit and blood and treasure we can afford to forfeit in meeting our responsibility to keep peace and freedom. So while we may and should offer substantial amounts of economic and military assistance to our allies in their time of need, and help them maintain forces to deter attacks against them usually we cannot substitute our troops or our will for theirs. We should only engage our troops if we must do so as a matter of our own vital national interest. We cannot assume for other sovereign nations the responsibility to defend their territory without their strong invitation when our freedom is not threatened. On the other hand, there have been recent cases where the United States has seen the need to join forces with other nations to try to preserve the peace by helping with negotiations, and by separating warring parties, and thus enabling those warring nations to withdraw from hostilities safely. In the Middle East, which has been torn by conflict for millennia, we have sent our troops in recent years both to the Sinai and to Lebanon, for just such a peacekeeping mission. But we did not configure or equip those forces for combat they were armed only for their self-defense. Their mission required them to be and to be recognized as peacekeepers. We knew that if conditions deteriorated so they were in danger, or if because of the actions of the warring nations, their peacekeeping mission could not be realized, then it would be necessary either to add sufficiently to the number and arms of our troops in short to equip them for combat, . . . or to withdraw them. And so in Lebanon, when we faced just such a choice, because the warring nations did not enter into withdrawal or peace agreements, the President properly withdrew forces equipped only for peacekeeping. In those cases where our national interests require us to commit combat force we must never let there be doubt of our resolution. When it is necessary for our troops to be committed to combat, we must commit them, in sufficient numbers and we must support them, as effectively and resolutely as our strength permits. When we commit our troops to combat we must do so with the sole object of winning. Once it is clear our troops are required, because our vital interests are at stake, then we must have the firm national resolve to commit every ounce of strength necessary to win the fight to achieve our objectives. In Grenada we did just that. Just as clearly, there are other situations where United States combat forces should not be used. I believe the postwar period has taught us several lessons, and from them I have developed six major tests to be applied when we are weighing the use of U.S. combat forces abroad. Let me now share them with you: First, the United States should not commit forces to combat overseas unless the particular engagement or occasion is deemed vital to our national interest or that of our allies. That emphatically does not mean that we should declare beforehand, as we did with Korea in 1950, that a particular area is outside our strategic perimeter. Second, if we decide it is necessary to put combat troops into a given situation, we should do so wholeheartedly, and with the clear intention of winning. If we are unwilling to commit the forces or resources necessary to achieve our objectives, we should not commit them at all. Of course if the particular situation requires only limited force to win our objectives, then we should not hesitate to commit forces sized accordingly. When Hitler broke treaties and remilitarized the Rhineland, small combat forces then could perhaps have prevented the holocaust of World War II. Third, if we do decide to commit forces to combat overseas, we should have clearly defined political and military objectives. And we should know precisely how our forces can accomplish those clearly defined objectives. And we should have and send the forces needed to do just that. As Clausewitz wrote, ``no one starts a war or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war, and how he intends to conduct it.'' War may be different today than in Clausewitz's time, but the need for well-defined objectives and a consistent strategy is still essential. If we determine that a combat mission has become necessary for our vital national interests, then we must send forces capable to do the job and not assign a combat mission to a force configured for peacekeeping. Fourth, the relationship between our objectives and the forces we have committed their size, composition and disposition must be continually reassessed and adjusted if necessary. Conditions and objectives invariably change during the course of a conflict. When they do change, then so must our combat requirements. We must continuously keep as a beacon light before us the basic questions: ``Is this conflict in our national interest?'' ``Does our national interest require us to fight, to use force of arms?'' If the answers are ``yes,'' then we must win. If the answers are ``no,'' then we should not be in combat. Fifth, before the U.S. commits combat forces abroad, there must be some reasonable assurance we will have the support of the American people and their elected representatives in Congress. This support cannot be achieved unless we are candid in making clear the threats we face; the support cannot be sustained without continuing and close consultation. We cannot fight a battle with the Congress at home while asking our troops to win a war overseas or, as in the case of Vietnam, in effect asking our troops not to win, but just to be there. Finally, the commitment of U.S. forces to combat should be a last resort. I believe that these tests can be helpful in deciding whether or not we should commit our troops to combat in the months and years ahead. The point we must all keep uppermost in our minds is that if we ever decide to commit forces to combat, we must support those forces to the fullest extent of our national will for as long as it takes to win. So we must have in mind objectives that are clearly defined and understood and supported by the widest possible number of our citizens. And those objectives must be vital to our survival as a free nation and to the fulfillment of our responsibilities as a world power. We must also be farsighted enough to sense when immediate and strong reactions to apparently small events can prevent lion-like responses that may be required later. We must never forget those isolationists in Europe who shrugged that ``Danzig is not worth a war,'' and ``why should we fight to keep the Rhineland demilitarized?'' These tests I have just mentioned have been phrased negatively for a purpose they are intended to sound a note of caution that we must observe prior to committing forces to combat overseas. When we ask our military forces to risk their very lives in such situations, a note of caution is not only prudent, it is morally required. In many situations we may apply these tests and conclude that a combatant role is not appropriate. Yet no one should interpret what I am saying here today as an abdication of America's responsibilities either to its own citizens or to its allies. Nor should these remarks be misread as a signal that this country, or this Administration, is unwilling to commit forces to combat overseas. We have demonstrated in the past that, when our vital interests or those of our allies are threatened, we are ready to use force, and use it decisively, to protect those interests. Let no one entertain any illusions if our vital interests are involved, we are prepared to fight. And we are resolved that if we must fight, we must win. So, while these tests are drawn from lessons we have learned from the past, they also can and should be applied to the future. For example, the problems confronting us in Central America today are difficult. The possibility of more extensive Soviet and Soviet-proxy penetration into this hemisphere in months ahead is something we should recognize. If this happens we will clearly need more economic and military assistance and training to help those who want democracy. The President will not allow our military forces to creep or be drawn gradually into a combat role in Central America or any other place in the world. And indeed our policy is designed to prevent the need for direct American involvement. This means we will need sustained Congressional support to back and give confidence to our friends in the region. I believe that the tests I have enunciated here today can, if applied carefully, avoid the danger of this gradualist incremental approach, which almost always means the use of insufficient force. These tests can help us to avoid being drawn inexorably into an endless morass, where it is not vital to our national interest to fight. But policies and principles such as these require decisive leadership in both the Executive and Legislative branches of government and they also require strong and sustained public support. Most of all, these policies require national unity of purpose. I believe the United States now possesses the policies and leadership to gain that public support and unity. And I believe that the future will show we have the strength of character to protect peace with freedom. In summary, we should all remember these are the policies indeed the only policies that can preserve for ourselves, our friends, and our posterity, peace with freedom. I believe we can continue to deter the Soviet Union and other potential adversaries from pursuing their designs around the world. We can enable our friends in Central America to defeat aggression and gain the breathing room to nurture democratic reforms. We can meet the challenge posed by the unfolding complexity of the 1980s. We will then be poised to begin the last decade of this century amid a peace tempered by realism, and secured by firmness and strength. And it will be a peace that will enable all of us ourselves at home, and our friends abroad to achieve a quality of life, both spiritually and materially, far higher than man has even dared to dream.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am hoping that some of the misconceptions or misperceptions that might be out there can be alleviated, because I don't believe that this should be considered a controversial bill in any way. There are some issues with respect to questions about favoritism or reverse discrimination, et cetera. Some of these issues have been raised in other contexts.But in this particular instance, simply because the word or the phrase Native Hawaiian is attached, I hope that it doesn't confuse the issue. I have just had the opportunity to speak with Mr. Boehner, and I believe that we have an understanding about what is at stake here.Let me make very, very clear what we are talking about. It reauthorizes a Native Hawaiian housing block grant through 2012. Now, these funds are used for infrastructure development and homeownership assistance under a program that is administered by the State of Hawaii as the result of Federal legislation in the last century. The bill that is on the floor today did not originate with Representative Hirono or myself, but is as a result of the request of the Hawaiian Homes Commission and its chairman, under the leadership of Governor Lingle, Governor Linda Lingle, who is a Republican.The reason I bring that up is not to cite that for special consideration, but rather that this is not a Democrat and Republican issue. This is an institutional issue that whoever is Governor, and whoever are the commissioners, in this instance happen to be Republican, appointed by a Republican Governor. Those folks are obligated institutionally to bring these issues to the Congress for final adjudication because of the unique status, the unique legal status of the Hawaiian Home Lands.The Hawaiian Home Lands were created by the Congress as a result of legislation put forward by the original delegate from the Hawaiian Islands to the Congress, Prince Kuhio, Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalaniana'ole, for whom the Federal building is named where I have my offices in Honolulu, the PJKK. Mr. Renzi may refer to the PJKK Federal Building. He was a Republican at the time, and as a result of his presentation, the original Hawaiian Home Lands were created.It enables Hawaiian families on Hawaiian Home Lands under this unique legal status to be able to acquire private financing they otherwise can't get because they are under this legal admonition to go through the Hawaiian Homes Commission. So it allows the Hawaiian Home Lands, the Department, to be eligible for loan guarantees to borrow, issue bonded debt, enabling servicing up to five times their annual allocation.This allows the Department to service low-income families without a large increase in Federal appropriations. That's the whole idea of it. It allows low-income Hawaiians to get their refinancing in addition to construction. It reduces the cost of homeownership, and it reduced risk by lowering monthly mortgage payments. That is what this is about. It's no special consideration. It is fulfilling the law as it exists.",

And also, I want to reiterate my thanks to Mr. Boehner for his open-mindedness and his attitude of being willing to listen on issues that might otherwise have been easily misunderstood. I am grateful also to Mr. Cole of Oklahoma for his participation and for his leadership in again helping us to discern issues that are of distinct advantage, not just to our particular constituents in Hawaii, but on the whole issue of how we are able to help people achieve homeownership, achieve an opportunity not to be dependent on government, but rather to be able to participate in the American Dream, the overall American Dream in a way that has genuine meaning for them and their families.I am very pleased to see that this has not become a partisan issue, and that it has not ended up dividing us when we should, in fact, be united in our opportunity to minimize the effect of government having bad consequences for people, and maximizing the opportunity for the ordinary individual and the ordinary individual's family to be able to advance the family's cause.In this particular instance then, Mr. Speaker, I am very, very pleased that we are able to move forward on this, and I hope that the vote will be a solid one and that we can move forward to other issues not only where homeownership is concerned, but advancing the capacity of families to be able to succeed in the American Dream.I would like to express my gratitude to the gentlelady from California, and express my thanks to her for the leadership of her and her committee in bringing this forward. Again, Mr. Speaker, before I close, my deep respect for and gratitude to Mr. Renzi and for all those who helped bring this forward on the Republican side of the aisle.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I will just recapitulate for a couple of moments, then perhaps we can move to the conclusion.I indicated last night, and I think it was agreed to by Mr. Bachus of Alabama and others, by way of material that has been entered into the Record, like Mr. Renzi of Arizona, that this should not be a partisan fight. In fact, ``fight'' probably is the wrong word, but, I mean, even a disagreement here.The reason that this bill passed overwhelmingly last week, with significant support from the Republican side of the aisle, was that it was supported in committee by Republicans and Democrats. The bill is here before the Congress as a result of a request by Hawaii's Republican Governor, and the former Chair of the Hawaii Republican Party, who is now the head of the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.We have always had legislation in this area based on the underlying law, which was passed in 1921, by the Congress, setting aside certain lands for Hawaiians. The issue before us is about refinancing of home mortgages. This is not about whether the original law, under which the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands was established, it is constitutional.On the contrary, that issue has been raised, and it perhaps should be raised in another context; namely, if someone wants to change the underlying law. But we should not punish my constituents or anybody's constituents for the fact that they appear before us in the form of a bill trying to carry forward on the admonitions required of them, in this instance, by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in order to get their mortgages refinanced.Let me say, just as recently as February 9 of this year, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against a group of individuals who came before the court, saying that funding for programs that benefit Hawaiians, in this instance, of this bill, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, constitutes an unconstitutional discrimination against non-Hawaiians.The Federal appeals court ruled that was not the case. In fact, they returned it to the U.S. District Court to see if the plaintiffs were eligible ``in any other capacity.'' That is to say, other than whether it was constitutional.So we have, as recently as the last 30 days, appeals court admonitions that the constitutionality of having programs for Hawaiians is, in fact, constitutional.If someone wants to argue that, please let's argue it on the basis of a bill that addresses that itself, rather than the bill which is before us, which has to do with the refinancing of mortgages. Please don't punish people that are trying to own their own homes, to keep their own homes, because of some ideological difference that we might have.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the final passage of H.R. 835, the Hawaiian Homeownership Opportunity Act of Opponents of this bill believe this program may be unconstitutional based upon a mistaken interpretation of Rice v. Cayetano. But Rice v. Cayetano was a voting rights case. The question put to the Court was whether limiting the right to vote for trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to Native Hawaiians violated the 15th amendment. The court in Rice specifically declined to rule on the status of Native Hawaiians and Native Hawaiian programs created by Congress.Moreover, this bill and these programs have never been a partisan issue in the past. This reauthorization and improvements were requested by Hawaii's Republican administration and Governor Linda Lingle. The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands is chaired by the former head of Hawaii's State Republican Party. This bill was introduced last year by Congressman Bob Ney and was reported out of the Financial Services Committee by voice vote and without amendment. Last Congress's Republican chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mike Oxley, cosponsored this bill.I mention these pieces of background information to illustrate the wide support for the program and the fact that it has been both Democratic and Republican. Last week, when this bill was up for consideration in the House under a suspension of the rules, the GOP leadership issued a statement just hours before the vote, calling the bill ``unconstitutional'' and charged that it would ``confer on Native Hawaiian an arrangement like that between the federal government and American Indian tribes.'' Despite these charges, the bill was able to garner 34 Republican votes.The status of Native Hawaiians needs to be debated and should be debated in the House. However, this is the wrong venue for that. I have another bill pending in the House of Representatives that would establish a process for the Federal recognition of Native Hawaiians. I hope to have this legislation considered by the House Natural Resources Committee and will gladly debate these issues at that time.This measure is about helping low-income Native Hawaiians own their own home. The programs reauthorized by H.R. 835 simply provide funds for infrastructure, helps Native Hawaiians obtain mortgages and allows for refinancing to lower the cost of homeownership. This bill is about assisting Native Hawaiians to reach the American dream of owning their own home.I believe this bill can, and should, pass with overwhelming bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to vote for final passage of this bill and support efforts to get more low-income people into their own homes.",

    "title": "CELEBRATING ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Asian Pacific American (APA) Heritage Month. As you know May is designated as APA Heritage Month, and this year's theme is ``Meeting the Challenges for Asian Pacific Americans.'' One of the central challenges is the need for comprehensive immigration reform.I serve as the Immigration Task Force Chairman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC). The caucus includes members who are of Asian Pacific descent and those who represent Congressional Districts with significant APA populations, like the First District of Hawaii.The Immigration Task Force is CAPAC's main voice on this important and timely issue. Right now, APAs face an immigration backlog that has forced many families to live for years apart from their loved ones. For example, Filipinos must wait 23 years before United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) even examines their applications for a brother or sister from the Philippines. Furthermore, 1.5 million Asians live in the U.S. as undocumented immigrants. They live in the shadows without access to basic services, and are vulnerable to exploitation.As Task Force Chairman, I have made it a priority for CAPAC to support Comprehensive Immigration Reform. True immigration reform not only helps us secure our borders, but addresses the issues of family reunification and earned legalization for undocumented immigrants. With that concern, I cosponsored H.R. 1645, the ``Security Through Regularized Immigration and a Vibrant Economy (STRIVE) Act of 2007,'' and I am working now to get members of CAPAC to support this bill.The ``STRIVE Act'' would help eliminate the family backlog by no longer counting spouses and minor children of naturalized citizens against the worldwide cap on family-based immigration. That means remaining visas can reduce the backlog for the other classes of family-based immigrants. Such a move not only serves as a humane gesture, but upholds our core family values.The ``STRIVE Act'' also addresses the concerns of the undocumented immigrants, providing for earned legalization, which means that people would be allowed to emerge from the shadows. Illegal immigrants would have to pay fines and back taxes, pass criminal background checks, and meet English and civics learning requirements. Contrary to the rhetoric, these immigrants would not jump ahead of those who have pending legal visa applications, but would instead have to wait their turn. Furthermore, they would not count against either the family-based or employment-based immigration caps.While not perfect, the ``STRIVE Act'' is an excellent start to solving the immigration reform problem. As we celebrate the contributions of APAs to the nation, we must rededicate ourselves to a new direction; to meet the challenges faced by APA families. That is how we open the door to the American dream to all Americans.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H. Res. 355, a resolution recognizing and welcoming the leaders of the Pacific Islands to Washington, D.C., and commending the East-West Center for hosting the Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders.The United States has always had a unique relationship to the Pacific Islands. Not only do they help play a key role in the fight against terrorism, but these governments also aid the U.S. in its overall security. Furthermore, both the U.S. and the Pacific Islands rely on the vast resources of the Pacific basin; these resources while enormous are not unlimited, and management requires cooperation across all of our governments. These islands also work closely with the U.S. on an important environmental and security concern, global climate change, which has the potential to drastically affect all who depend on the Pacific for their livelihood. Furthermore, trade, tourism, and other economic ties further reveal the interdependence between the Pacific Islands and the U.S. The resolution before us recognizes these factors.As we mark Asian Pacific American (APA) Heritage month, we would also be remiss to not point out that Americans of Pacific Island decent are a rapidly growing ethnic group within the U.S. They add strength to our communities with their diversity and values, and they make important contributions to the U.S. as a whole. The resolution also mentions this important fact.Furthermore, the resolution discusses the importance of the East-West Center, which runs the Conference of Leaders. Congress established the East-West Center, which is based in my district, in 1960. The East-West Center seeks to establish a dialogue between the peoples and nations of Asia, the Pacific, and the U.S. The East-West Center provides a home for academics who perform vital research that helps all parties better understand each other's history and culture. The Center's Education and Outreach sphere helps disseminate what researchers learn to the broader public and to policymakers. Finally, the Center provides important dialogue programs. Under the effective leadership of Dr. Charles Morrison, the East-West Center continues to address the challenges of the Asian-Pacific 21st Century.Established in 1980 the East-West Center's Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders grows out of these dialogue programs. It seeks to bring together leaders from the region to discuss many of the issues I mentioned earlier. In the era of growing interdependence between the U.S. and Pacific Island governments, both the work of the Center and the Conference of Leaders becomes more important.I urge my colleagues to support both this resolution, and provide continued support to the East-West Center.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support legislation that has been introduced by my colleague, Congresswoman Bordallo. H.R. 1595, the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act, would honor the residents of Guam for their loyalty and compensate them for the atrocities they suffered during the Japanese occupation of Guam.During World War II, Guam was invaded, seized and occupied by Imperial Japanese forces for nearly three years. The war destroyed much of Guam, including housing, public buildings, utilities and infrastructure. In addition, the people of Guam suffered many deaths and an untold number of acts of brutality. This ruthless brutality has left a lasting impact on the survivors of the war and the descendants of victims.In 1947, the Secretary of the Navy commissioned a civilian committee on the Naval Administration of Guam and American Samoa to prepare a report with specific recommendations. The report became known as the Hopkins Report and was submitted to the Secretary of the Navy in 1947. Among other things, the report addressed deficiencies in the war claims process for Guam immediately after the war ended. In the cover letter submitted with the report, the committee stated, ``Only so can justice be done to a valiant group of Americans who at great cost to themselves remained steadfastly loyal during the war . . . in so special a case this government could well be very generous in method of distributing its relief as well as generous in amount awarded. It has been neither.''Many decades later, the 107th Congress authorized the Guam War Claims Review Commission to determine if the people of Guam received parity in claims as compared to other Americans who experienced losses and damages during the war. In 2004, the Commission submitted their final report to Congress and found that Guam's residents were inequitably treated.There has been legislation to address this inequitable treatment in every Congress since 1985. Two hearings have been held, one in the 108th Congress and one on in the 109th Congress. It is time to follow the recommendations made by both the Hopkins report and the Guam War Claims Review Commission by providing adequate reparations for the people of Guam. It is time to honor them for their sacrifices.Congresswoman Bordallo has done a fantastic job over the years to create the most fair and equitable legislation that Congress can pass. I hope the people of Guam know that this issue is being addressed and the people have not been forgotten.I urge my colleagues to support the people of Guam and vote for final passage.",

    "text": "Madam Chairman, let's go over what this does do and why it's here.This amendment places a 1-year ban on flag and general officers in the Armed Services from receiving compensation from any company that does greater than $50 million in business with the Department of Defense. The rationale is very, very straightforward. It assures that large corporations, relying on DOD business, do not take advantage of loopholes in the post-employment ethics laws right now. That's what this is addressing, what exists right now.Current laws govern conduct-based actions. Conduct-based actions and restrictions that are in there now are meaningless because there's what's called behind-the-scenes and in-house provisions. I didn't make this up. This is what's going on right now. If I'm going to get lectured on ethics, let's talk about ethics. Former flag and general officers cannot overtly attempt to influence government officials. We know that. The $50 million ensures that small businesses seeking access to the DOD market are protected and people can go to work for them.It does not impact officers pay grade O-6 and below. We are talking about the top people up here making the top money making the top decisions with Department of Defense organizations.The amendment protects senior officers from large DOD prime contractors seeking to gain undue influence during their time in service. You think you walk out the door of the Pentagon and down the stairs and by immaculate conception can go to work for one of these DOD corporations and not have tried to influence that job beforehand or negotiate that job before you walk out the door?Take public universities. From the publication that just came out in March of 2007, of all the universities in the country, only two universities in the country are doing more than $50 million worth of business. So that is open that you can go to.Dwight Eisenhower, more than 40 years ago, way back in 1961, warned us about the military industrial complex that was emerging in our country. And I am quoting: ``Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions.''I think President Eisenhower's words speak for themselves. The amendment speaks for itself. This is an implementation of an ethics rule that should apply to the Pentagon, and I would think that people of goodwill would want to embrace it.",

Moreover, this does not impact officers paygrade O-6 and below.Why include all flag and general officers? While not all flag and general officers are involved in procurement, they can be involved in the development of future military systems and operational requirements or have ``official responsibility'' for an acquisition program.This amendment will protect senior officers from large DoD prime contractors seeking to gain undue influence during their time in service. The ``prime'' contractors in the DoD industry are so pervasive and ingrained that they have been referred to as ``quasi-agencies'' in the media. One private company received over $24 billion in DoD contracts, an amount equal to the budget request for the Department of Justice for Fiscal Year 2008 budget request totals $24.02 billion.Another concern is the impact on the ability of these former officers to teach at universities. Well over 1,000 schools are listed in the Federal Science and Engineering Support to Universities, Colleges and Nonprofit Institutions: FY 2004 Report released March 2007--only two schools received more than $50 million in DoD funds (Johns Hopkins and University of Texas at Austin).I urge my colleagues to support closing loopholes in our ethics laws and vote in favor of this amendment.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 406, celebrating the accomplishments of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, also known as the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act, and recognizing the need to continue pursuing the goal of educational opportunities for women and girls.Title IX changed the way the United States educates its women and girls. It states that, ``No person in the United States, shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.'' This monumental legislation has had far-reaching effects on the women in this country. Title IX may be best known for its changes in athletics, but the academic world has been significantly changed as well. Since 1981, women have received more bachelor's degrees than men, and since 1986, women have received more master's degrees than men. None of this would have been possible without the hard work of Patsy Mink and Edith Green. Generations of women have and will benefit from the work of these women.I had the honor of serving with Patsy Mink for 12 years, representing the State of Hawaii in the U.S. House of Representatives. She strove to ensure equality and fairness for all Americans. Through her work on title IX, she was able to accomplish just that for every American woman. The renaming of title IX to the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act honors her work and reminds us all of her dedication to equality.We should take this time to reflect on where we have come from and the progress we have made. Millions of women have access to the education to make their dreams come true, and that access was guaranteed 35 years ago by a woman who believed that we should all be able to better our lives.",

I can assure you of that.I think I know something about tourism. I know that in order to have tourists, you have to have people with jobs that have sufficient discretionary income to be able to come and spend their money. But if we're destroying the industrial structure of this country, which is what we're about right now, there won't be anybody having the jobs to be able to come and spend the money on tourism or anything else.And if you want them to arrive in automobiles, which we can't do yet because I haven't been able to get an earmark for that bridge from San Francisco to Hawaii, that's a bridge to somewhere, I can assure you, the question then would be, well, what are you going to be paying for your gasoline? You want to have a hybrid car, you're going to have natural gas. You have to have natural gas as the base. You want to have ethanol to be able to do it? You have to have natural gas for the fertilizer that's going to grow the feedstocks in order to create the ethanol.Natural gas is the natural energy bridge to a natural energy future, to an alternative energy future. If we don't have natural gas, let me tell you what's going to happen. It's happening right now, and there has been references to it already. Europe and Russia are now making a deal to promote natural gas exploration and extrication from Russia to the European economy, to the European Union in the hundreds of billions of gallons in order to be able to compete with us. It's not just mythology that the Chinese, using inferior technology, will be some 45 miles off of Florida right now exploring natural gas, as the Canadians are already doing on the other side of the Great Lakes.Every single industrial country in this world is producing natural gas right now except us. We are the ones that destroying ourselves, committing suicide on this. This is what is happening; the rest of the world is going to have an industrial base and an industrial complex that's able to compete, and we're destroying ourselves.You're looking at a convert here. I went into the Resources Committee fully prepared to not only sustain the moratorium that's here, but to vote against Mr. Peterson when he first brought up the idea of drilling for natural gas. But when I listened to him and I read all the facts involved, I decided that I had the wrong position. And what's required of us now is to become energy independent. We have to produce the energy in this country that is going to allow us to be independent, sufficient to be able to back up that Defense Department that we're talking about. The Air Force right now is spending an enormous amount of money on fuel that we have to import. If we can take the natural gas base for the Air Force right now, we stand a chance of producing fuel that can sustain ourselves.We have to be energy independent in this country. And that means those of who us who have blindly supported, what were supposedly the right environmental proposals in the past have to take an honest look at where we are today and what we can do to produce clean energy.Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the time. I hope that when we get past this today, that we will deal with the bill that Mr. Peterson and I will be bringing forward to produce natural gas in this country to produce a free and independent America.",

The President of the United States, Republican or Democrat, including this President, has put these funds in the budget in order to meet the obligations of the contract.Again, Mr. Chairman, I am not familiar with how the gentleman from the Eighth District of Georgia handles contracts, but we honor them where I come from.There is 200,000 acres set aside, and the original legislation states as follows, section 1065-569, I commend to the gentleman's attention: ``Congress does not extend services to Native Hawaiians because of their race, but because of their unique status as the indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to whom the United States has established a trust relationship.''The Admissions Act that brought us into the Union as the 50th State says specifically that, with regard to these lands, the Hawaiian Homes Lands, that they are to be administered by the State of Hawaii and the United States ``for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians as defined under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920.'' And it goes on from there to cite what is involved.Now, the block grant program provides funds for infrastructure to help Native Hawaiians obtain mortgages on lands set aside for them from Congress. Because of the conditions set out by the Congress, ordinary financing is not available to them. This is why we have to do it. If the gentleman had had the courtesy to sit down for 2 minutes with us, we could have explained what this was about.A decision has to be made here. Of course we have to come and defend our programs. Everybody does. I am quite content to do that.But this is the first time ever in my experience, my legislative experience of more than 33 years, that this kind of thing has taken place.Now, I know you folks over there. I'm looking at friends of mine right here. You would never have, me or Ms. Hirono would never do this kind of thing to you. If you have a disagreement about it, come and see us. Let's sit down and talk about it. And if you still disagree with what we're doing and why we're doing it, by all means bring it to our attention on the floor. But these kinds of attacks are unworthy of this House. It's unworthy of us to have relationships with one another like this. I don't understand it. I've never experienced it before.Now, we can do this in 5-minute segments if we want to, but that's not the way to handle this. I appeal to you, if this is going to be a continuing onslaught, let's sit down and talk it over.This legislation, the Department of Hawaiian Homelands is one of the most effective housing efforts that we have in order to try and meet the conditions that were set forth by the Congress and administered faithfully by the State of Hawaii since our entrance to the Union in 1959.The House supported reauthorization of this program; 272 Members, including 45 Republicans, voted for it. It is not a partisan issue.And I'll finish with this, Mr. Chairman. The Republican Governor and the Republican Members of the House of Representatives and the Senate in Hawaii, as well as the Democrats, support this program. It is not a partisan issue.And so I ask, out of courtesy for Members, that if we're going to have a discussion about this, at least let's have it on the merits of what the issue is before us. And if we're going to do this kind of thing, at least have the courtesy, the common courtesy that should be extended to any Member of House, to let us know that it's happening so perhaps, Mr. Chairman, we could resolve the issue beforehand.The Acting CHAIRMAN.

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, once again I find myself on the floor wishing that I had an opportunity to perhaps discuss the issue that is raised in the amendment. I wish really honestly that the courtesies would be extended on this to one another, not just on this issue but on any issue where it affects individuals.Let me explain for a moment if I can to you and some others who may be listening in, Mr. Chairman. Here is a list of votes on Native issues. There are 52 Members, 52 Members who have tribes in their districts, some multiple. Some of them are Republican Members who are sponsors of this bill. Each of them has unique questions and problems that have to be dealt with. It goes to Republicans, it goes to Democratic districts.I find it distressing that this is becoming more and more a partisan issue for some folks in the Republican Conference. I can't comprehend it exactly.As I say, here is 52. Here are some of the votes that were taken, Minority-Serving Institutions, Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity Act, 59 votes against it all from Members of the Republican Conference.Motion to amend the Small Business Act to expand and improve assistance provided by small business development centers to Indian tribe members, Alaskan Natives and Native Hawaiians, 73 members of the Republican Conference. I am not quite sure why this is happening.I don't understand why Native issues and issues having to do with indigenous people and minorities find now an increasing number in the Republican Conference who are voting ``no'' on it. I wish we could get a dialogue established in some way to try and understand why Native people are being attacked.In this particular instance, Mr. Chairman, I bring to your attention and the Members' attention the Admission Act that brought Hawaii into the Union. The Admission Act requires that we address questions such as those in the present bill that is before us.Now if someone wants to attack the Admission Act, I suggest they go to court and do that. All we are doing here and all that is being requested in this bill that is before us is that which is required of us by law in order to accomplish the task at hand. If someone is opposed, and I invite once again the Members here who have this amendment, why attack us? Why attack our people for trying to implement the law? Attack the law. Change the law if that is what you want to do, if that is what you think is necessary.We have 200,000 acres set aside for the betterment of Native Hawaiians. That is what the law says we are supposed to do. That is what the Admission Act which brought us into the United States says is required of us.I can quote: Any such lands income, therefore, shall be held by the said State as a public trust for the support of the public schools and other public educational institutions and for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians for the development of farm and home ownership, as widespread a basis as possible, and for making public improvements and provisions of lands for public use.That is what the Admission Act says we are supposed to do, for the betterment of Native Hawaiians. That is what this is about. If one is opposed to that for everybody, for all of the tribes and so on, I guess we can take it up with the other Members and so on. I don't know. But I don't think here on the floor in any bill that is a consequence of trying to fulfill our obligations constitutionally is the way to go about it. Take it to court. Put in a bill to do that, but don't hurt us today.",

    "text": "Just a couple of notes. My good friend from Iowa was complimentary to me, and I am appreciative of that. I want to indicate to him, perhaps he misunderstood my intention in citing just a couple of instances where the vote was taken by himself and others with regard to minorities, with regard to Native Alaskans and tribal members and Native Hawaiians.The reason that I cited it was not because I was trying to look for something for them that they did not deserve or would not prove useful to them, but let me explain why I cited them, because I thought it was undermining the principles that were cited by our friend from Georgia and our friend from Iowa, initiative, working yourself up the economic and social ladder of success.Take the two bills. First, the Minority Serving Institutional Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity Act. If you go into the bill itself, what it is is to try to assist in the areas where minorities are at issue, with trying to increase their capacity to do business, to increase their abilities to deal with wireless technology, digital technology today, as the keystone to economic opportunity and economic success. It's to give people the opportunity to increase their ability to pay their taxes to participate in the American foundation of American economic opportunity so that they could actually increase their capacity to succeed economically.The same with the other bill, which is why I cited it. I thought that these were the kinds of things that we could all get behind, improve and expand the small business development centers. I know, out in Hawaii, for a fact the small business development centers have been crucial to getting small businesses under way to aiding and assist people who need not just a handout but a hand up, and to give them the technical skills not ordinarily available to them, to give them some of the institutional references that they need to make in order to be able to apply for loans to succeed in achieving, getting the loans to get started, particularly microloans and so on.I can't speak for you, but I am sure you, as well, are familiar with small business development centers. What we are trying to do here, in the area of Indian tribe members, Alaskan Natives and Native Hawaiians is to extend that helping hand so they can participate even further and achieve the very goals my good friend from Iowa and my good friend from Georgia have cited as being worthy of pursuit, not just by way of legislation, but by way of the everyday activities of constituents as they try to partake in the American Dream.That's all this is about. We want to give people the opportunity legislatively to take advantage of the small business development centers, to take advantage of the new wireless technology in a way that might not have been available to them otherwise.The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price).",

It requires us all to work together.Now, there are some, I am sorry to say, on both ends of the spectrum of the parties who want to diminish what the bill is all about and what its intent is all about. Someone went so far yesterday as to say, well, this bill is like naming post offices.Well, yesterday, we named two post offices for marines that were killed in Iraq. I don't suppose the author of that kind of commentary would like to speak with the family of the marines who have been killed about why these post offices were named.I think it's pretty important that we concentrate on those who are bearing the brunt of the policies that we approve of in this body. That's what this is all about. We want to end the party sniping. We want to end the commentary about advantages being taken from one party or another.Cover has been mentioned, about whether it would be given to one party or another. The only cover that we are interested in is the cover that has to be obtained by our fighting men and women in the field, because they are engaged in battle as a result of the policies that we either approve or disapprove of.It's time for the Congress to take back its responsibility.Madam Speaker, I would like to enter into the Record a commentary from the Government Accountability Office as of the end of July of this year.Issues that DOD needs to consider in planning and executing the draw down and redeployment of forces from Iraq:What issues will the Department of Defense consider in the planning and executing of the draw-down and redeployment of forces from Iraq? It includes the draw-down, scope, the costs, the timetable, the capacity issues, logistics issues. These are the serious and sober subjects of what will be presented to us by these redeployment plans.You cannot have a redeployment by wish fulfillment alone. You have to have the practical realities in front of you in order to accomplish it. That's what we are seeking to do. That's what the Armed Services Committee on a bipartisan basis sought to accomplish with this bill. This is serious and sober business.Section two of the measure states the strategy required ``shall include planning to achieve the following.'' That's what we mean by the status of the planning. Status of the planning will include the transition of combat forces from policing civil strife or sectarian violence in Iraq.It has to include a projection in the number of members the Armed Forces required for the missions described in the redeployment. The details of what these redeployment plans will encompass are included in the bill, and so the preamble that is there that says the original resolution has now been accomplished takes us to this final conclusion that we reach today, the redeployment of our troops in a responsible way and a bipartisan manner.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I submit for the Record a statement from Stuart W. Bowen, Jr., Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Forbes, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to address you today on the work of the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. To ensure accurate context, permit me to outline several points essential to understanding the challenges of investigating and prosecuting fraud in Iraq. First, corruption within the Iraqi government, indeed within the fabric of Iraqi society, is a serious problem that inhibits progress on many fronts in Iraq. This is widely recognized by the Government of Iraq and the international community. In our quarterly reports, SIGIR has called Iraq's endemic corruption problem a ``second insurgency.'' I returned last month from my 16th trip to Iraq and, during my visit, I met with the Commissioner of Public Integrity, who heads the institution created by the CPA to increase accountability for public corruption in Iraq--and the President of the Board of Supreme Audit, the analogue to the Government Accountability Office, which has existed in Iraq for many decades. The Iraqi anti-corruption authorities again emphasized to me the widespread nature of the problem of corruption, which stretches across the government, afflicting virtually every ministry. And they outlined for me the difficulties they face in implementing their respective anti- corruption mandates. The CPI Commissioner told me that he currently has 2,000 cases involving $5 billion in alleged corruption. And the President of the Board of Supreme Audit has hundreds of audits ongoing. In virtually every case, he is uncovering a lack of accountability. Let me emphasize that the CPI and the BSA oversee Iraqi money--not U.S. money--that is missing or has been stolen from Iraqi programs. During my visit, I was informed about political interference with the work of Iraqi investigators and prosecutors. For example, I learned that Ministers and former Ministers are exempt from prosecution unless the assent of the Prime Minister is obtained; and each Minister is entitled, under an Iraqi criminal code provision, to immunize selectively ministry employees from being held accountable for corruption. Iraq must make progress on rule of law enforcement, in general, and corruption, in particular; political interference with fighting corruption remains a problem, undermining the effectiveness of the developing rule of law system and consequently eroding the Iraqi people's confidence in their government. Iraq is a sovereign state. The role of the United States thus is to encourage the development of an efficient Iraqi justice system. We do this for its own sake and for the sake of maintaining and building upon the efforts made, at great cost in blood and treasure, by Americans and Iraqis since the liberation of Iraq. SIGIR's specific role in this process has been to review the effectiveness of United States efforts to improve the rule of law system and to build up the corruption-fighting capacity of the Iraqi government. On July 28, 2006, SIGIR released a survey on this subject and found that American efforts were funded at a very modest level, given the scope of the problem, receiving about $65 million (about three-tenths of 1 percent of our total reconstruction spending). My auditors found that American efforts have not been sufficiently coordinated and focused and that more adequate leadership and organization was needed. The U.S. Embassy has responded to some of these concerns since the review was released. SIGIR will soon release another review on the issue, updating our previous report. SIGIR has a continuing investigative responsibility to detect and investigate malfeasance in American relief and reconstruction programs in Iraq. As part of this effort, we have developed good working-level and leadership-level relationships with the CPI and the BSA. We coordinate with these Iraqi agencies whenever we come across evidence of potential wrongdoing by Iraqis. SIGIR, of course, concentrates its law enforcement efforts on American targets and works with the Department of Justice in their effective prosecution. My second point is that the incidence of corruption within the U.S. reconstruction program--judging from those cases that we have uncovered thus far--appears to constitute a relatively small component of the overall American financial contribution to Iraq's reconstruction. Based on the work of our 18 career investigators on SIGIR staff, I believe that losses to American taxpayers from fraud within reconstruction programs will likely amount to a relatively small component of the overall investment in Iraq, totaling in the tens of millions (rather than hundreds of millions or billions, as is sometimes imagined). However, the fact that the fraud we have detected is relatively small (to date) does not diminish the aggressiveness with which SIGIR pursues allegations of fraud in Iraq. We have found egregious incidents of fraud. And in partnership with the Department of Justice, SIGIR has produced clear results in prosecutions and convictions. For example, in January, two individuals were sentenced to prison as a result of SIGIR investigations. In early February, indictments were announced of five more individuals, resulting from SIGIR investigations. To date, SIGIR has opened over 300 cases, and we have over 70 ongoing investigations. Thirty-two of those cases are under prosecution at the Department of Justice. We believe that the publicity our enforcement actions have received has helped to deter misconduct in the U.S. reconstruction program. And we also believe that enforcement will be an increasingly important part of SIGIR's mission over the next 18 months. Moreover, in the course of this year, we expect to produce concrete investigative results as significant current cases come to fruition. SIGIR remains committed to a robust, deterrent presence in Iraq as long as our temporary organization exists. Today, I have five investigators on the ground in Iraq investigating fraud. Although there are other law enforcement agencies fighting fraud in Iraq, SIGIR has maintained over the past 3 years the largest contingent of fraud investigators in Iraq. My investigators travel the country under dangerous conditions, pursuing leads, interviewing witnesses, and piecing together evidence on a wide variety of cases. Their work also takes them to other countries in the region. Of note, SIGIR is currently reducing its overall personnel ``footprint'' in Baghdad in conjunction with the reduction in spending of appropriated dollars on Iraq reconstruction. One of the most important aspects of our investigative efforts is the development of task-force relationships with other agencies involved in oversight in Iraq, including may colleagues from the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Defense and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation. SIGIR has 16 investigators in Arlington, and we are participating in the new Joint Operations Center located at the FBI to coordinate and enhance fraud investigations in Iraq. SIGIR's first task force was the Special Investigative Task Force for Iraq Reconstruction (SPITFIRE), and it combined the efforts of the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Homeland Security, Immigrations and Customs enforcement office, the FBI and the Department of State Office of Inspector General. That task force was able to effectively pursue the Bloom-Stein conspiracy that my auditors uncovered in Hillah, Iraq--a very egregious kickback and bribery scheme involving over $10 million in reconstruction funds that Philip Bloom, the contractor, and Robert Stein, the Coalition Provisional Authority comptroller for that region, engineered for their own criminal ends. SPITFIRE continues its work today; and we continue to pursue a number of leads that arose from the Bloom-Stein case. The other major task-force initiative that SIGIR has initiated with the FBI is the International Contract Corruption Task Force (ICCTF). ICCTF prompted the creation of the Joint Operations Center mentioned above, which is producing the effective collection and coordination of investigative leads and source development. Although I am not at liberty to discuss details of these cases, I am very pleased with the very significant progress the JOC investigators have made, news of which I expect to be forthcoming later this year. Along with SIGIR, the ICCTF includes the U.S. Army's Criminal Investigative Division's Major Procurement Fraud Unit, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the FBI, and the inspectors general of the Department of State and the Agency for International Development. SIGIR is also part of the DOJ National Procurement Fraud Task Force. We continue to work closely with DOJ in the investigation and prosecution of our cases. Finally, to coordinate efforts in oversight in Iraq, I formed the Iraq Inspector Generals' Council, IIGC, 3 years ago, which brings together every agency with oversight authority in Iraq for a meeting every quarter. The IIGC exists to deconflict and coordinate the member agencies' oversight efforts in Iraq. SIGIR is not limiting its efforts just to addressing contractor misconduct through the criminal justice system. We also refer cases to the U.S. government's administrative debarment and suspension processes. To date, the competent oversight authorities have, through established rules that preserve due process, suspended 17 companies and individuals, debarred ten, and have another nine pending debarments. To date, SIGIR has produced 13 quarterly reports, 86 audit reports, and 90 inspection reports. Our auditors and inspectors regularly refer investigative leads to our investigators some of which have developed into very significant cases. The Bloom-Stein case is just one example. SIGIR's three lessons-learned reports produced to date have provided recommendations on policies designed to improve economy, efficiency and effectiveness for the Iraq program and for future reconstruction and stabilization operations. The reports have prompted the introduction of reform measures in the Congress that will improve contracting processes. SIGIR is at work on a lessons-learned capping report, which will be produced at the end of this year. It is my hope that our lessons learned reports will prompt reforms that will improve the capacity of law enforcement to deter crime. Mr. Chairman, with respect to H.R. 400, Representative Abercrombie's bill entitled the ``War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007,'' our position is essentially what it was when we were asked to reflect on its counterpart at a Senate hearing this past March. SIGIR remains a strong proponent of legislation that would strengthen efforts to punish fraud or abuse in contracting programs in Iraq or elsewhere. We look forward to working with the Department of Justice to enforce H.R. 400, should it become law. We are, however, unaware of instances where the Justice Department was unable to prosecute, under existing law, on the facts we developed in our investigations. One of our responsibilities in Iraq is to encourage efficiency in the reconstruction effort. In that role, we have prompted management to seek the widest possible participation by business enterprises (especially Iraqi firms) in reconstruction. The security risks in Iraq are self-evident, and thus the risks to any business enterprise operating in such an environment are mammoth. International companies likely will not get into the business of reconstruction in Iraq without incentives that render the risk-taking worthwhile. This reality should figure in the development of legislation that affects contracting in Iraq or similarly insecure environments. Whether H.R. 400 becomes law, SIGIR will continue to aggressively pursue investigations, provide robust oversight through audits and inspections, and will press for more efforts to improve contract administration, quality assurance, and quality control. It is my hope that our continuing efforts will help promote an aim we all share--a reconstruction program that is administered and executed honestly, and is as well-managed and efficient as possible under very challenging circumstances. Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, thank you for your time and attention to these important matters, and I look forward to answering your questions.",

    "text": "I want to pay a special thank you, a big mahalo, to Mr. Scott and to the Judiciary Committee for their hard work. I am very grateful to the ranking members, the Republicans and Democrats. We cannot resolve this without seeing to it that we have a bipartisan approach on this.I am particularly grateful to Senator Pat Leahy, who is the Judiciary Chairman in the Senate, for entrusting this bill to our care here in the House and allowing me to introduce it as a companion bill to the one that has passed in the Senate. I am very hopeful that we can get a vote in the Senate and move this to the President's desk.When the wrong computer equipment arrived in Iraq, the contractor ordered it dumped into a mammoth burn pit and placed an order for replacements, rather than sending it back. The government paid for both the wrong computers and the replacements. The contractor collected a fee for each, thanks to a cost-plus contract.Halliburton had drivers driving empty trucks between bases in Iraq, unnecessarily exposing the drivers to danger, because the company was paid by the trip, not by the amount of materiel hauled or a flat fee; $186 million was spent over 2 years to build 142 health care centers, yet only 15 have been completed and only eight are open. According to testimony, the contractor lacked qualified engineers, hired incompetent subcontractors, failed to supervise construction work, and failed to enforce quality control.A large U.S. construction company was paid tens of millions of dollars to repair Iraq's schools. Many of the schools were never touched, and several that were repaired, and I say that in quotes, were left in shambles, one filled with unflushed sewage.At least 10 companies with billions of dollars in contracts have already been forced to pay up to $300 million in penalties to resolve allegations of bid-rigging, fraud, gross overcharging, delivery of faulty military parts and environmental damage, $300 million in penalties. Some of these same companies have faced such allegations during past military operations in other countries, but have had no problem receiving new contracts in Iraq.Despite millions of dollars in payments to U.S. companies, key pieces of Iraq's infrastructure, power plants, telephone exchanges, sewage and sanitation systems, have either not been repaired or have been fixed so poorly that they still don't function.How has this been allowed to happen? The United States Government directly and through the late Coalition Provisional Authority have outsourced the war in Iraq like no other in our history, spending more than $50 billion on private contractors to provide food, water, gasoline and other supplies, guard bases, drive trucks, and many other activities in support of our troops.But consistent with the administration's overall attitude toward spending public money with private companies, little or no thought was given to contract oversight or accountability. As a result, some of these contractors have declared the U.S. occupation of Iraq open season on the taxpayer. Cleaning up this mess has been hampered by the fact that while anti-fraud laws protect against the waste or theft of U.S. taxpayers in the United States, there have been no statutes prohibiting sleazy business practices by American companies overseas.As we have learned in the investigation of the Blackwater USA contract, the Coalition Provisional Authority issued order number 17, which specifically exempted U.S. contractors from Iraqi law.In fact, one contractor was found guilty of 37 counts of fraud, including false billing, and was ordered to pay more than $10 million in damages, but the decision was overturned because the contracts were let through the Coalition Provisional Authority, and it was found that U.S. laws against fraud did not apply.Despite the fact that the Coalition Provisional Authority was created by the Bush administration under the Department of Defense; despite the fact that L. Paul Bremer, the overseer in Iraq, subsequent to the initial attack on Iraq, had an office literally across the hall from Secretary Rumsfeld, the Coalition Provisional Authority was not considered part of the U.S. Government, and, therefore, U.S. laws were unenforceable.These practices are a flagrant abuse of the public's trust and the public's money during a time of war and cannot be allowed to continue. H.R. 400, the War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007, will, one, criminalize war profiteering defined as contract fraud or overcharging for goods and services in connection with the mission of the United States Government overseas; two, violations of law will be a felony and punishable up to 20 years in prison and fines up to $1 million or twice the illegal profits of the crime; three, jurisdiction for such cases, no matter where the alleged crimes are committed, will be in the United States Federal court.H.R. 400 was heard and considered by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security and ordered reported to the full Judiciary Committee by a voice vote on August 1. Among the many significant consequences of the decision to invade and occupy Iraq marked by a complete dismissal of the need for intelligent planning and stunning incompetence in the conduct of the war, this problem has received too little attention from the news media, the public, and the Congress.Most of the cases of fraud, questionable business practices and outright corruption have been uncovered and investigated through the efforts of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, Mr. Stuart Bowen, Jr. Mr. Bowen and his super staff both here in the U.S. and on the ground in Iraq have provided oversight and insight under the most difficult conditions imaginable for billions of American taxpayer dollars intended to rebuild Iraq and support our troops in combat. They deserve our gratitude. They deserve the gratitude of the Congress and the Nation for a tough job well done.Mr. Speaker, this bill, together with H.R. 2740, legislation passed by this House last week to expand the reach of the Uniform Code of Military Justice to private civilian security operatives in the region are two important steps this Congress is taking to clean up the mess in Iraq.H.R. 400, in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, the War Profiteering Prevention Act will help end the open season declared on American taxpayers.",

As Mr. Scott has pointed out, the standard is very high and applies to any contract, whether it's in the United States or overseas. There is nothing applied to the contracts overseas that is not applied to a contract here in the United States when it comes to the question of fraud or overcharging or deliberate deception with regard to the contract. That standard has to be met in any court and has to come before any judge meeting such a standard. There is no differentiation whatsoever.The reason the bill is here, and the reason we're bringing the legislation, is the courts have ruled that there is, at best, an ambiguous situation, if not an outright gap between the capacity for prosecution of such a crime, should the standard for the crime be sustained by a prosecutorial investigation, and what is possible in Iraq. It can't be prosecuted in Iraq, and the courts found that it wasn't. We did not have legislation sufficiently clear in the United States in order to prosecute it. Thus, far from arbitrary or capricious prosecution, we have the opportunity for arbitrary defrauding of the United States taxpayer with no consequences. That's why the legislation is here.",

    "text": "Rather than having a motion to recommit, because I would ask you not to do that for the reasons already enumerated, this deserves our specific attention. And we both know, I think, what happens on a motion to recommit: people come to the floor; they see superficially what's involved. Who can argue about everybody wanting to have civil rights?And I don't want to have to get into a debate with you about the question of recommittal. Here is what section 7 says of the bill, if you would allow me: ``Prior to conferring Federal recognition on a reorganized governing entity, the Secretary of the Interior must certify that the organic governing documents provide for the protection of the civil rights of the citizens of the entity, as well as all other persons affected by the exercise of the entity's governmental powers and authorities. In addition, the organic governing documents must be consistent with applicable Federal law. If the Secretary finds that the organic governing documents, or any part of these documents, do not meet these requirements, the organic governing documents will not be certified.''This has to be certified by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting every Federal responsibility. Now, up until this time, and I am sure you agree, if the Speaker will just grant me a little more time and if you will, this bill has never been subject to partisan rhetoric or activity in the committee or elsewhere. From a realistic point of view, motions to recommit really have to do with who is in charge and who is not in charge and that kind of thing. I am not disputing that your question isn't real. But the motion to recommit essentially is repeating, in some fashion, without my quite knowing what the real consequences of that language would be, whereas the language that I am citing to you from section 7 has been vetted again and again and again by minority staff, majority staff, legal staff all over to fit exactly what the gentleman seeks to succeed with.So I am asking you not to make a motion to recommit on the basis that what I have read to you, in good faith, is language that has been put forward in good faith within the existing bill. And if you conclude that it is not adequate, I pledge to you that I will certainly sit down with you as will Mr. Kildee and anyone else who is interested in it to try and see what we can do to make the language work as the bill moves along. But I don't want to get trapped in a recommital action which may then put language into the bill, the consequences of which I have no idea. Nor, I think, does the gentleman.Your intentions are good. I have complete faith and say so publicly in your intentions and your desire to make this a better bill. So I ask you on the basis of a collegial respect for each other and on the basis of our friendship to let the bill go without a recommital based on section 7 and my promise to you that we will address any and all issues that may still be on the table once you have had a chance to examine the consequences of the language you might otherwise propose.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, this bill before us is the result of years of bipartisan and nonpartisan work, which has been mentioned. I take second to none my regard for Mr. Flake and recitation once again of our personal regard for one another; however, I am afraid that the reason I have to oppose this motion to recommit is for precisely the reasons I mentioned during our previous dialog.I am pleased that he actually read what the motion to recommit says because the part here, and you may recall in my previous commentary where I said we can't be sure what the consequences might be unless we have had a chance to vet them. The bill itself has been vetted again and again by counsel on both sides of the aisle and by groups that have an interest in the bill. This is the consensus that this meets all relevant legal technicalities.Here, look what it says: ``The Native Hawaiian governing entity shall be subject to the United States Constitution's Bill of Rights and other protections in the same manner and to the same extent as a State or local government of the United States.'' That is an invitation to an avalanche of litigation. How are you going to define ``same manner'' and ``same extent'' of a State or local government?The indigenous people, whether they are Native Americans in tribes, whether they are Alaska Natives in corporations, Native Hawaiians trying to put together a government, and they are not a State, they are not a local government, and to say in a motion to recommit that we are going to require them to exactly replicate State and local governments, which is subject to litigation all the time, you would have to have a trust fund set up to handle the litigation, I think, that would result from that.Mr. Speaker, I don't think that that is Mr. Flake's intent. In fact, I would stipulate that that is not his intent. Our problem is we haven't had a chance to sit down and go over this to see whether we can cover any of these contingencies. I wish he had accepted my plea, my offer, and I wish he would stand up now and say, I have seen the light and I am going to withdraw my motion to recommit. Because if you go to number (i), applicability of Federal civil rights laws, it says the same thing with respect to civil rights and antidiscrimination laws in the same manner and to the same extent as a State or local government of the United States.My friends, my colleagues, I agree that Mr. Flake has brought this not for political reasons but because of his sincere belief that this needs to be addressed. I can assure you that if anything is political, this is political by default. Far from saying simply that it is a simple explication of his point of view, it is an absolute wellspring of complication to try and figure out what the same extent of State and local government laws are with regard to civil rights, antidiscrimination or Bill of Rights and other protections. ``Other protections,'' what does that mean? That will be litigated to death.So, Mr. Speaker, I ask Mr. Flake, now that I have analyzed his simple language for him, if he would reconsider withdrawing the motion to recommit. If he does not, I pledge to him now that if we are able to defeat the motion to recommit, which I think should be defeated by anybody who's worked on this bill. I make this final plea in all seriousness, Mr. Speaker. We have worked too hard, come too far on a nonpartisan basis, Republican and Democrat alike, to come to this conclusion and throw ourselves into the briar patch of State and government applicability of laws as recommended in the recommittal. The bill itself deals with all these issues on civil rights.Mr. Speaker, I ask that the motion to recommit be defeated and that we move to a vote, an overwhelming vote on the underlying bill, H.R. 505, which is an exemplary product, a singular stalwart example of what bipartisan work can do in this House of Representatives.Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, inasmuch as this is a discussion on the rule and not necessarily on the bill itself, I would like to confine my remarks, at least in this initial phase of dealing with the issue, on some of the points raised by my good friend and colleague Mr. Hastings. I am appreciative of the points that he raised, because I think they are in need of not so much refutation but perhaps clarification.It is easy to understand why those who are not necessarily familiar, and I am not speaking about Mr. Hastings personally, I am talking about the references that he cited in his commentary, it is easy to understand why people who are not familiar with a little bit of the history of Hawaii could come to some of the conclusions or make some of the observations that they have. Absent the context within which this bill is coming forward, it is understandable. That context then is what I want to establish, so that it becomes clear.I certainly don't want to get in an argument with the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal either, and they are making some quotations there about complete territorial independence.Well, I think what is being referred to there, and what the likelihood of the reference is, is that there was in fact not territorial in the sense of annexation of territory, like the Philippines or Hawaii or Puerto Rico or that kind of thing that occurred during the kind of ``imperial phase'' of the United States, but there was in fact territorial independence, because Hawaii was a kingdom. It is one of the things that kind of gets lost in the shuffle, and that is one of the reasons we are here today, Mr. Speaker.The United States of America has in fact had, over a 175-year period leading up to the overthrow of the kingdom in 1893, a series of treaties and conventions; 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, 1887, dealing with commerce, dealing with trade, dealing with various recognitions. The Kingdom of Hawaii had treaties and conventions with other nations, as well as the United States.So as a result of that history, we have a succession of land claims and assets that have come from the time of the kingdom to the shotgun republic that occurred after the overthrow of the kingdom and the annexation of the United States into the territory, and into finally becoming a State, as was indicated, in 1959. We are in fact the last State to enter the Union, along with Alaska in 1959.I bring this up simply to point out that far from subdividing the American people, as was cited by my good friend, quite the contrary; it incorporates the politics as well as the historical reality of this land secession and the assets associated with it, because this land generates income.Basically what this is about, Mr. Speaker, is land and other assets, including money, and who controls it. When this land came in, it wasn't worth anything. The Wall Street Journal did not comment, I am certain, on the ceded lands. They are called ``ceded lands'' because they were ceded from the kingdom to the succeeding governmental entities. They could care less, the Wall Street Journal, about these lands when they were worth nothing, when they were not seen to be able to be marketed.But let me explain now, and I ask my good friend as I look at him now with a smile on my face, we are talking about land in Hawaii? You are talking big bucks. You are talking money here. That is what this is about is land and money and who controls it. And this land has, from the time of the kingdom, resided with the Native Hawaiians. That is who is to be the beneficiary.That takes me to the point, Mr. Speaker, of the entry into the Union. The Admissions Act requires us, requires us, the Admissions Act of 1959 requires us to utilize those lands and assets for the benefit of Native Hawaiians. That is in the Admissions Act.We are not here on the floor today because we didn't have anything better to do in Hawaii than to try to bring this to the Federal Government. On the contrary, the Admissions Act requires us to make certain that these lands are utilized for the benefit of Native Hawaiians. The reason we have the bill here is that in order to accomplish that, we need to get a governing entity that can come to the Department of the Interior for approval in order to be able to conduct the affairs, similarly to, parallel to what now happens with Native Americans in the so-called lower 48 in the mainland of the United States and with various Alaska Natives and corporations and other entities that have been set up in Alaska.This is a history of indigenous people. They are different from other indigenous people because they were a kingdom, and we would not have the 2 million acres we are talking about had those acres not been associated with an indigenous people. They are not imaginary, they are real.Finally, let me say with Rice v. Cayetano, Governor Cayetano, the first Filipino American to be elected Governor, that issue was settled on a question of voting procedures and had nothing whatsoever to do with programs for Native Hawaiians.",

    "title": "EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR H.R. 760, THE ``FILIPINO VETERANS EQUITY ACT OF 2007''",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my deep support for H.R. 760, the ``Filipino Veterans Equity Act of 2007.''The treatment of Filipinos who fought with the United States Armed Forces in World War II is a dark chapter in American history. The Philippines became a United States possession after Spain ceded it as part of the treaty ending the Spanish-American War in 1898. In 1934, Congress created a 10-year time frame for independence through the ``Philippine Independence Act.'' However, since the Philippines remained a colonial possession until 1946 the United States retained the right to call upon military forces organized by the Philippine Government into the United States Armed Forces.On July 26, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a military order that brought the Philippine Commonwealth Forces under the control of the United States Armed Forces during World War II. These men bravely fought with our own troops during the war, and many perished or suffered severe wounds from the battles in the Western Pacific Theater. After the surrender of Japan, Congress required the Philippine Forces to continue their service. Many helped occupy lands, many oversaw military operations, and many made the ultimate sacrifice to secure our victory in World War II. Yet, when wartime service ended formally in 1946 they did not receive the same benefits and the same treatment as other American soldiers.Yet, for all their heroic and courageous actions, Congress passed the ``Recession Act'' in February 1946, to the objection of many, including General Macarthur. This essentially denied Filipino Veterans any of the benefits that their American comrades in arms received; including full access to veterans' health care, service-connected disability compensation, non-service connected disability compensation, dependent indemnity compensation, death pension, and full burial benefits. No other group of veterans has been systematically denied these benefits.Congress has the opportunity to right this wrong. H.R. 760 restores the benefits these brave warriors were denied. This legislation has been introduced since 1992. However, time is running out. In September 2000, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) estimated that the number of surviving Filipino Veterans is 59,889. However, by 2010, VA estimates that their population will dwindle to just 20,000, because of their advanced age.Many argue that paying for Filipino veterans is not something Congress should undertake, because they are not U.S. citizens, and that the PAYGO offsets takes money away from Americans. However, such a statement fails to recognize that Filipino veterans served not merely as allies, but as U.S. forces. It fails to recognize that the United States made the same promise to provide for these veterans' needs as it does to any other person who serves in uniform; a promise that we have, up to now, failed to uphold.Congress must act now for the sake of justice and to show that we Americans truly appreciate the sacrifice these men made. Let us remember the heroism of these veterans by honoring their service and fulfilling our commitments to them. I urge the House to consider and pass this important measure.",

We have two identical, competing committees by design. Now, I defy anybody in this House to go to your next Rotary Club meeting and try to explain what that is all about.Any referral to the Office of Congressional Ethics will be seen as tantamount to a guilty verdict.

This is about the House, and its membership should decide whether any Member has failed to meet its standards, not appointees who have not served or are not currently Members of the House.An ethics investigation is by definition peer review. Any appointee to the Office of Congressional Ethics who has not served in the House has no credibility in terms of judging Members or the conduct of House standards.And does anybody believe that complaints won't be in the media immediately, regardless of validity? The press irritation with the House Ethics Committee is because it has actually practiced confidentiality.This is an invitation to ideological mischief and character assassination. We say this is about our ability to police ourselves. The effect will be just the opposite. The House Ethics Committee no longer has any discernable function other than to affirm whatever has been referred to it.All this makes me sad, and it makes me angry. I have devoted every bit of energy in my life for nine terms to this House. I revere the opportunity for service in the people's House. With this proposal we are indicting ourselves.

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.H.R. 4933, the Captive Wildlife Safety Technical Amendments Act of 2008, was introduced by my colleague from Guam (Ms. Bordallo). As Mr. Kennedy indicated, unfortunately, she cannot be here in person at the moment because she is on her way here from Guam, but hopefully will arrive before the end of the proceedings. Coming as I do, Madam Speaker, on a 5,000 mile one-way commute, I have a lot of empathy and sympathy for her journey. But the issue before us today is very, very important both to her and to Members of the House and, by extension, the Nation.The Captive Wildlife Safety Act, Public Law 108-191, amended the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981, and that made it unlawful for any person to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any prohibited wildlife species.After the law was enacted, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Justice identified technical drafting problems that made full implementation and enforcement impossible. H.R. 4933 would make those technical changes to the law needed to allow the original intent of the legislation to be achieved.Madam Speaker, on a personal note, I might add that, under Chairman Pombo, I had the privilege of traveling with him to Africa for the CITES, Convention on International Treaty on Endangered Species, so we could see with our own eyes what the consequences are by not having legislation like this correctly in place. The wildlife species are totally dependent upon human beings as the stewards of this planet and, most certainly, as the stewards of their welfare and for the salvation of endangered species, not just in our country, but overseas as well. Therefore, I ask Members on both sides to support passage of this noncontroversial bill.May I say also, Madam Speaker, what a privilege it is to be on the floor with Mr. Bishop of Utah.

    "title": "INTRODUCTION OF NCAA FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP EQUITY RESOLUTION",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, today I have joined with my colleagues Congressman Simpson of Idaho and Congressman Westmoreland of Georgia in introducing a resolution to end disparity in college sports that is an unintended consequence of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). This resolution declares the BCS an illegal restraint on trade, and demands that the US Department of Justice take the proper actions to investigate and end the unfair BCS system. It also encourages the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to establish a true football playoff system to determine the national collegiate football champion in the interest of parity and sportsmanship.The BCS is fundamentally unfair. Non-BCS schools, those in conferences not automatically qualified for the BCS bowls, are at a disadvantage prior to the first kickoff of the season. Non-BCS schools must basically have perfect seasons, and must be the best of over 50 schools to even be considered to play in a BCS bowl, while schools that belong to conferences that are automatically-qualified for BCS bowls (BCS schools) must only be the best of 8-12 schools, depending on the conference they compete in. Six of the ten schools that participate in the BCS bowls qualify by becoming the regular season champion of a BCS automatically-qualifying conference: the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), Big 10, Big 11, Big Fast, Pacific-10. and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The four others are determined based on rankings, conference standings, and in some cases, selected by bowl officials. There is also a rule prohibiting more than one non-BCS school from competing in a single year.These unfair eligibility requirements produce effects that go far beyond restricting access to playing for the national championship. The BCS generates hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue annually, and this money is disproportionately awarded to BCS conferences. Of the more than $217 million generated by the 2006-2007 post-season bowls, $185 million, or 85 percent went to the BCS schools, which represent 66, or 55 percent of Division I schools. Money generated by the post-season games help schools cover costs for their athletic departments, facilities, equipment, recruitment, and other sports programs. Non-BCS schools must use their general funds to cover costs of their athletic departments, which takes funding from academic and administrative needs.The lopsided distribution of BCS revenue results in two tiers within the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division 1), those with access to the BCS, and those without. Those without are unable to change their situation as the money and prestige associated with the BCS makes it highly unlikely that a non-BCS school will be able to compete for the same recruits, coaches, sponsorships, national television exposure, and the revenue it generates. This disparity keeps them in the second-class status and must be changed.Questions about the legality of the BCS have also arisen. Legal scholars have analyzed the anti-trust aspects of the BCS, and some have concluded that the BCS violates the Sherman Anti-Trust Act under the Rule of Reason test. This requires that the competitive benefits of the system outweigh the anti-competitive effects. However, the anti-competitive effects of the financial gain and recruiting advantage of the BCS schools can easily outweigh the pro-competitive benefits of arranging for the top two ranking BCS teams to play for the national championship.Many have called for the end of or change to the BCS, and the current system is only the latest reincarnation. The NCAA has, on multiple occasions, studied and considered moving to a playoff to determine the national champion. Successful BCS school football coaches and presidents have called for a playoff system, as have presidents of non-BCS schools. Congress has held multiple hearings questioning the fairness of the BCS and states have introduced and passed legislation calling for changes to the system.NCAA football is the only college team sport without a playoff determining the national champion. While the NCAA Basketball Championship's format will not transfer perfectly to college football, it is an ideal system. All Division I schools start the season with an equal chance of making it to the playoffs. The championship is decided on the court by the players and their talent, not rankings and their schedule before the tournament. The basketball championship also allows for a nearly annual ``Cinderella story,'' an underrated team that defies expectations, upsets traditionally strong opponents and competes deep into the tournament. This year it was Davidson College, a member of the Southern Conference, which was seeded tenth in its region and made it to the Elite Eight, beating former champion Georgetown University, the University of Wisconsin and Gonzaga University along the way. This scenario is highly unlikely in the BCS system, as there is little chance for a non-BCS school to even be offered an invitation to play. Non-BCS schools, the University of Hawaii in 2008 and Boise State University in 2007 were undefeated going into the BCS and were not even given the opportunity to play for the national championship.Something must be done to ensure that money and opportunity are evenly distributed among all college football programs. Congress should act in the interest of all the athletes, coaches, staff and supporters to guarantee parity and competition in college football. The current system leaves much to be desired and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution calling for the NCAA Division I national champion to be determined by a playoff.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 5613, the ``Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act of 2008,'' a bill that I proudly cosponsored. The bill would place a 1-year moratorium on proposed Medicaid regulations by the Bush administration intended to save money.Unfortunately, these cuts would take Federal funds from States at a time that many are struggling to meet obligations within Medicaid and other programmatic areas. By limiting access to rehabilitation and targeted case management services, the administration cynically attacks the poorest and weakest members of our society. Eliminating the reimbursement for transportation services for certain special needs students would deny them the basic right to an education. The regulations halt important payments to hospitals at a time that many across the Nation and within my home State of Hawaii are actually losing money.Placing the 1-year moratorium would help us better asses the full impact of these disastrous cuts, and come up with a plan that controls the growing costs of Medicaid without harming quality, as these regulations seem to do. The extent of the unpopularity of these cuts is clearly shown by the expedited move by the Committee on Energy and Commerce to report the bill unanimously to the House floor, in contravention of the President's veto threat.Medicaid provides medical coverage for the poorest and neediest of our country. It is the insurer of last resort for many who have either lost jobs or are barely subsisting. To take away these funds at this time is cruel and undermines the intent of the very program. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.",

    "title": "COMMEMORATING ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Asian Pacific American--APA--Heritage Month. I am pleased to celebrate this important event.May 2008 marks 30 years since President Jimmy Carter signed a joint Congressional resolution declaring the first 10 days of May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Week. In 1992, the commemoration was extended to the full month of May.While it's an appropriate time to note the achievements of Asian Pacific Americans, APAs, we cannot overlook the needs of the community, including a fair and sensible immigration policy. I chair the Immigration Task Force of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus's, CAPAC, and I will continue to fight for the needs of family within the immigration debate.The challenge has become much more difficult in the last year because the presidential primary campaigns have poisoned the discussion, focusing all their attention on undocumented immigrants from Mexico and calls for higher fences and tougher enforcement. Completely ignored is the fact that immigration issues facing Asian and Pacific Americans are far different. And those issues have been completely drowned out by the shrill demonization of illegal immigrants.One of the major issues for the Asian Pacific American community is family reunification: allowing relatives of legal permanent residents, other than spouses and minor children, to immigrate legally and join their families. It can take the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) as long as 23 years to even consider an application for a family member from the Philippines.The extended family is a foundation in many of our cultures, and it provides real benefits to the greater society as well. Families often pool resources to educate children or purchase homes and establish roots in their communities. We often see extended family networks starting businesses, providing economic development and jobs.It is important that we move the debate on immigration past the bumper sticker solutions that have dominated the public dialog and work together to advocate for the needs of family. I believe we must find a just, practical and humane response to the 12 million undocumented immigrants living in the shadows of our society. But, we cannot forget that families that are separated tear at the very fabric of what America means. I urge my colleagues to learn more about this issue during APA Heritage Month and throughout the year, and work for comprehensive and human immigration reform for the APA community.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I have the honor to serve as the chairman of the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee of our Armed Services Committee. I would like first to thank my own personal archbishop, Doug Roach, and all the acolytes on the Air and Land subcommittee, the subcommittee staff. They do a terrific job working with Ike Skelton's overall staff, led by Erin. I cannot tell you what a pleasure it is every day to be working with them in the manner in which they conduct themselves; professional, disciplined, focused, something I wish I could say about myself more often than I do.Again, on the personal comment side, I want to thank my good friend, Duncan Hunter. Always, without fail, in all these years, attentive, polite, always welcoming commentary and seeking advice. We may say farewell to you, Duncan, but we will not be saying goodbye.Finally, Mr. Jim Saxton, whom I don't see on the floor today. Jim Saxton may have his position taken, but no one is going to replace him in this Congress. He has been my friend. He has been my mentor. I have served as a ranking member on various committees, not just here, but on other committees, as well as having the opportunity to chair. I never considered myself a ranking member or a chairman where Jim Saxton was concerned. We were colleagues.This bill is about balancing the capabilities and readiness of our current military forces with future required military capabilities. Our military personnel is at risk each and every day. The first priority is to make sure the men and women in uniform are properly supported by ensuring our military programs adequately support current military requirements.We cannot short-change our personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan in their need for adequate equipment and the needs of our National Guard units here at home for what they may require to respond to potential national disasters. Promised future capabilities that have already been delayed because of overly optimistic and unmet schedules cannot subsume meeting today's demonstrated needs.The Air and Land Forces Subcommittee's jurisdiction includes $90 billion in Army and Air Force programs. Our objective, Mr. Chairman, is clear, to ensure that our military personnel get the best available equipment as soon as it has been properly tested, equipment like armored vehicles, body armor, improvised explosive device jammers, unmanned aerial vehicles, small arms, and night vision devices.We address key requirements: An increase in Army procurement and research of $557 million over the budget request, procurement and research where it's needed now, demonstrating the commitment of the Armed Services Committee to meeting these many needs. The Army in particular is carrying the heaviest burden of all the services in the war in which we are now engaged. This bill shifts funding to critical Army priorities now; $2.6 billion to fund sustainments costs for the tactical vehicle referred to as the MRAP, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle, to better protect our personnel against mines and improvised explosive devices; $2.7 billion for counterimprovised explosive device programs, $949 million for Humvees, $783 million for body armor; $800 million for funding for much-needed National Guard and Reserve equipment.Yes, we have reallocated funds in this budget where we have to meet the needs of the serving Army and Air Force today.Fifteen C-17 strategic airlift aircraft added, at a cost of $3.9 billion dollars. It maintains the C-17 production line and sustains the strategic airlift fleet. Joint Strike Fighter competitive engine program has been funded for $526 million to provide necessary competition of two producers of engines for that program; $246 million added for systems to counter rocket and mortar attacks on our forces.To fund these priorities, we had to make reallocation choices to fund the highest priorities. Some programs will have to make adjustments. No program is adversely compromised. On the contrary, increased accountability and increased oversight are the result.In closing, I want to thank the distinguished chairman, all the ranking members of the full committee and the subcommittees, and may I say, Mr. Skelton, as I close, that it is a particular pleasure and an honor to serve with you. As I stand here today, I am thinking of Suzie Skelton. I know how proud she is of you.",

    "title": "RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DRUG COURT MONTH",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the nine drug courts in my State and around the country during National Drug Court Month. Over 2,100 drug courts in the United States provide an alternative to incarceration for non-violent, drug-addicted offenders by combining intense judicial supervision, comprehensive substance abuse and mental health treatment, random and frequent drug testing, incentives and sanctions, clinical case management and ancillary life skills services. The tireless efforts of the judges, prosecutors. defense attorneys, treatment providers, rehabilitation experts, child advocates, researchers, educators, law enforcement representatives, correctional representatives, pre-trial officers and probation officers that are involved in drug courts provide substance abusing offenders with the much-needed chance at long-term recovery and productive lifestyles.I have seen firsthand the impact of the drug courts in my State, where drug court programs have enhanced public safety, saved taxpayer dollars and, most importantly, saved lives. Since opening their doors, Hawaii's drug courts have graduated over 840 adult clients, 180 family clients, and 81 juvenile clients statewide. During fiscal year 2006, the recidivism rate for adult graduates was a mere 8 percent. For juvenile clients the recidivism rate was 13 percent. Family drug court clients experienced no recidivism whatsoever in 2006.As we face a growing population of drug-addicted offenders in the American justice system, we must expand our efforts to bring treatment to a larger number of those in need. According to a recent study by the Urban Research Institute's Justice Policy Center, approximately 1.5 million drug-involved offenders should be diverted to drug court, which would generate $46 billion in savings to American taxpayers. Armed with our existing research that drug courts work, reduce recidivism, and save lives and money, we must work on taking drug courts to scale.If society is truly going to save the lives of the addicted, break the familial cycle of addiction for future generations, have a substantial impact on associated crime, child abuse and neglect, reduce poverty, alleviate the over-reliance on incarceration for the addicted, and reduce many of the public health consequences in the United States, drug courts must be taken to scale. There is no greater opportunity for systemic social change in the American justice system. There is no greater opportunity to heal families and communities.Again, congratulations to the dedicated drug court professionals and graduates from Hawaii and around the country on a job well done.",

    "title": "MEDICARE IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS ACT OF 2008--Continued",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6331, the ``Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act of 2008.'' This bill makes some important changes in the Medicare program that help assure access for our seniors to quality medical care.The bill defers the 10.6% cut in physician reimbursements mandated by the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) that would go into effect on July 1, 2008. Instead, the bill continues the present reimbursement rate for 18 months and then increases it by 1.1%.The bill also provides important improvements for our senior citizens, increasing the allowable income and asset maximums for premium assistance. The co-payments for mental health services are reduced from 50% to 20%, the same as any other doctor visit.The legislation addresses problems within Medicare to pay for these benefits, reforming the system that overpays to Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, private plans that operate within Medicare, which cost the government on average 12% more than traditional services. The bill will also require that any delinquent taxes owed by Medicare providers be deducted from their Medicare reimbursements.In addition to improving Medicare services, the legislation also makes important changes to Medicaid, including a provision that is particularly vital for the people of Hawaii: Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments.Following an oversight in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, only Hawaii and Tennessee have not received DSH payments in Medicaid, which provide additional support to hospitals that treat large numbers of Medicaid and uninsured patients. This bill provides a temporary remedy, which will help keep these hospitals open.I have been working with Senator Daniel Akaka, the Hawaii Delegation and my colleagues on the Committee on Energy and Commerce to ensure that Hawaii and Tennessee receive equal treatment in the matter of DSH payments from the Federal Government. H.R. 6631 extends DSH payments for Hawaii and Tennessee through December 31, 2009, and provides an additional $15 million for Hawaii. This extension authorizes the submission by the State of Hawaii of a State plan amendment covering a DSH payment methodology to hospitals which is consistent with the requirements of existing law. The purpose of providing a DSH allotment for Hawaii is to provide additional funding to the State of Hawaii to permit a greater contribution toward the uncompensated costs of hospitals that are providing indigent care. It is not meant to alter existing arrangements between the State of Hawaii and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) or to reduce in any way the level of Federal funding for Hawaii's QUEST program.I will continue to work toward a permanent solution to the DSH matter, but until then, I urge my colleagues to support this measure. It is not an earmark, but merely provides Hawaii and Tennessee equity with everyone else.Again I want to thank Chairman Rangel, Chairman Dingell, Chairman Pallone, and Chairman Stark on this important piece of legislation that protects our seniors and provides equity for the State of Hawaii. I urge my colleagues to pass this vital bill.",

Res. 1436, a resolution to congratulate the Waipio Little League Team from the State of Hawaii for winning the 2008 Little League World Series.On August 24, 2008, the Waipio Little League baseball team won the Little League World Championship. Waipio defeated the Matamoros Little League team of Tamaulipas, Mexico, 12-3. This is the most runs scored by one team in a World Series title game since 1998. Waipio's victory by nine runs is also the largest winning margin by a US team over an international opponent in the title game,To get to the Little League World Series, Wapio went undefeated through the season. They went 3-0 in pool play, defeating teams from Connecticut, Florida and South Dakota. On August 20, 2008, Waipio won the United States Semifinal by defeating Mill Creek Little League, from Mill Creek, Washington. Then on August 23, 2008, they won the United States Championship by defeating South Lake Charles Little League, of Lake Charles, Louisiana. During this game, the team was down 5-1, but persevered and came back in the sixth and final inning by scoring six runs, to win the game 7-5.I would like to congratulate each member of the team and recognize their spirit and determination that got them so far: Iolana Akau, Jedd Andrade, Christian Donahue, Caleb Duhay, Ulumano Farm, Kainoa Fong, Trevor Ling, Keelen Obedoza, Khade Paris, Tanner Tokunaga, Jordan Ulep, Pikai Winchester, Matthew Yap, Manager Timo Donahue, Coach Kiha Akau, and Coach Gregg Tsukawa.Just as important, this resolution commends the team's families, coaches, and community for their support and dedication to enabling the success of the team on and off the field. Without this support, the team could not have traveled such a tremendously triumphant road.I would like to thank Chairman Henry Waxman and Ranking Member Tom Davis for the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's support in advancing this resolution. I would also like to thank Representative Mazie Hirono, Representative Eni Faleomavaega and Representative Madeleine Bordallo for their unflagging support and also that of Representative John Peterson, whose district hosts the Little League WorId Series.I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Waipio Little League Baseball team and their accomplishments and ask for your support of H.

Dr. Navin, a resident of Honolulu, has made many valuable contributions to the field of medicine not only in Hawaii, but throughout the United States.Dr. Navin began his medical career with the United States Army and has also served in the United States Army Reserve as well as the Hawaii Army Reserve National Guard, serving both Tripler General Hospital and Fort DeRussey. Dr. Navin is a recipient of the Bronze Star, as well as the Army Commendation Medal.He is the current president of the Hawaii Society of Pathologists, and a member of a variety of pathology related specialties, including the Hawaii Medical Association, the Honolulu County Medical Society, the College of American Pathologists and the American Society of Cytopathologists.I came to know Dr. Navin as a passionate healthcare advocate in the 1990s.

    "title": "GUAM WORLD WAR II LOYALTY RECOGNITION ACT",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support legislation that has been introduced by my colleague, Congresswoman Bordallo. H.R. 44, the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act, would honor the residents of Guam for their loyalty and compensate them for the atrocities they suffered during the long and violent Japanese occupation of Guam.During World War II, Guam was invaded, seized and occupied by Imperial Japanese forces for nearly three years. The war destroyed much of Guam, including housing, public buildings, utilities and infrastructure. In addition, the people of Guam suffered many deaths and an untold number of acts of brutality. This ruthless brutality has left a lasting impact on the survivors of the war and the descendants of victims. These sufferers wanted nothing more than survival and liberation under the U.S. flag.In 1947, the Secretary of the Navy commissioned a civilian committee on the Naval Administration of Guam and American Samoa to prepare a report with specific recommendations. The report became known as the Hopkins Report and was submitted to the Secretary of the Navy in 1947. Among other things, the report addressed deficiencies in the war claims process for Guam immediately after the war ended. In the cover letter submitted with the report, the committee stated, ``Only so can justice be done to a valiant group of Americans who at great cost to themselves remained steadfastly loyal during the war . . . in so special a case this government could well be very generous in method of distributing its relief as well as generous in amount awarded. It has been neither.''Many decades later, the 107th Congress authorized the Guam War Claims Review Commission to determine if the people of Guam received parity in claims as compared to other Americans who experienced losses and damages during the war. In 2004, the Commission submitted their final report to Congress and found that Guam's residents were inequitably treated.There has been legislation to address this inequitable treatment in every Congress since 1985. Two hearings have been held, one in the 108th Congress and one on in the 109th Congress. In the 110th Congress, the House passed H.R. 1595 under a suspension of the rules but the Senate was not able to act on the measure before final adjournment. It is time to follow the recommendations made by both the Hopkins report and the Guam War Claims Review Commission by providing adequate reparations for the people of Guam. It is time to honor them for their sacrifices.Congresswoman Bordallo continues to call for a resolution to this open wound and has done a fantastic job over the years to create the most fair and equitable legislation that Congress can pass. I hope the people of Guam know that this issue is being addressed and the people have not been forgotten.I urge my colleagues to support the people of Guam and vote for final passage.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2009, a bill to affirm and formalize the long political relationship between Native Hawaiians and the United States. This measure clarifies that political bond and provides a process for Native Hawaiians to form their own governing body and participate in a government-to-government relationship with the United States. This is a companion measure to legislation being introduced by Senator Daniel Akaka in the Senate this evening.The United States recognized the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hawaii more than 175 years ago, accorded the Kingdom full diplomatic recognition and entered into treaties and conventions in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875 and 1887, all ratified by Congress. The United States has declared in law a special responsibility for the welfare of the Native peoples of the United States, including Native Hawaiians.P.L. 103-150, the Apology Resolution, extended an apology to the Native people of Hawaii on behalf of the United States for our country's role in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893. The Apology Resolution also expressed the commitment of Congress and the President to acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow, and to support reconciliation efforts between the United States and Native Hawaiians.This relationship was explicitly affirmed in the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, which set aside 200,000 acres of land for homesteading by Native Hawaiians. Legislative history clearly shows that Congress based this action and subsequent legislation on the constitutional precedent in programs enacted to benefit Native Americans. In fact, since Hawaii's admission into the Union fifty years ago, Congress has legislated on behalf of Native Hawaiians, including them as Native Americans in numerous statutes.The legislation I am introducing today is important not only to Native Hawaiians, but to everyone in Hawaii. It provides a process to address many longstanding issues facing Hawaii's indigenous peoples and the State of Hawaii. In addressing these matters, we have begun a process of healing, a process of reconciliation not only between the United States and the Native people of Hawaii, but within the State of Hawaii.The essence of Hawaii lies not in the allure of its islands, but in the beauty of its people. The State of Hawaii has recognized the need to preserve the culture, tradition, language and heritage of its indigenous peoples. This measure gives form to the U.S. government's responsibilities in that same effort.",

    "title": "AUTHORIZING USE OF EMANCIPATION HALL FOR KING KAMEHAMEHA CELEBRATION",
    "text": "Mr. Brady, thank you for yielding.Mr. Speaker, Representative Hirono has given an excellent history of Kamehameha and the reasoning behind the celebration of his birthday as a State holiday in Hawaii. For the benefit of the Members and those who may not be familiar with the question of the statue itself and what it represents in the broader context, for those who may not be familiar with it, I would like to perhaps give a little bit of perspective, a little history on it.When people come from all over the world, not just the country itself, the Nation itself, to the Capitol, when they tour the Capitol, the most open capitol of any in the world, perhaps in the history of the world, we take pride, do we not, in the fact that this Capitol is open and available and accessible to all people, and we take some degree of pride, and rightfully so, that we are able to exhibit some of the history of this Nation for all to see and that each State has the opportunity to present for consideration of all of us two statues.One, of course, for us is Father Damien, who has just been named as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church. He came from Belgium to the United States to then, of course, the territory of Hawaii and ministered to those who had Hansen's disease, leprosy, on the Island of Molokai on the peninsula of Kalaupapa. His ministrations to those who had been abandoned, those who literally had been exiled to Kalaupapa resulted in the consideration by the Roman Catholic Church of miracles having been taken place in his name as a result of his dedication.The other statue representative of what we feel Hawaii is all about, of course, is Kamehameha. He's a legendary figure. The things that Representative Hirono cited, of course, are part of history. But when we use the word ``legendary'' to describe someone, it genuinely fits Kamehameha the Great.In his youth as part of this legendary history, he was known as a courageous warrior. He was said to have overturned the Naha Stone in Hilo, Hawaii, which indicated his almost superhuman strength and foreshadowed his inevitable conquest of all of Hawaii. I suppose it is the equivalent or a parallel could be drawn to the seizure of the Excalibur sword from the ground by the legendary King Arthur. This is the stature of Kamehameha. He did, in fact, unify the islands. And when he passed away in 1819, the phrase that was used with his passing is that ``only the stars know his final resting place.'' So the legend became even more of a tale to be told not only throughout the islands but throughout the world.So when people see that statue, when they observe that statue, they're somewhat shocked. It's monumental. I recall very, very clearly that in the rather obscure corner in Statuary Hall where Kamehameha originally resided here in the Capitol, it was somewhat difficult to find. People were not quite sure why it was there. It was said that because of the great weight of the statue itself it had to go there in order to be supported by the flooring of the Capitol. So in that position, Mr. Speaker, the really triumphant power and grace of the statue was not necessarily fully available to those who came to Statuary Hall. As a result, the Architect of the Capitol said to me, when we were first discussing the question of the visitor center and what is now Emancipation Hall, that he wanted very much to have the statue of Kamehameha in a very prominent position when the new visitor center was opened. He was certain that it would occupy an enormous presence there. It does that today. And we are very, very grateful for the opportunity for all to come and to view it.LUNGREN of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.",

    "title": "NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010",
    "text": "Mr. Chair, I have the honor of serving as the Chairman of the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee of our Armed Services Committee. I would like to thank our Chairman, Ike Skelton, for his great leadership in bringing this outstanding bill to this point. I also welcome the new Ranking Member, Buck McKeon, and am confident that he and Chairman Skelton will make a great team.I would also like to thank Roscoe Bartlett, our subcommittee's ranking member, for all his support and advice in putting our bill together.This bill is about balancing the capabilities and readiness of our current military forces with desired future required military capabilities.Our military personnel are at risk each and every day. Our first priority is to make sure those men and women are properly supported by ensuring our military programs adequately support current military requirements.We are doing everything possible to provide our personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan the equipment they need as well as provide for the equipment needs of our National Guard units here at home, to meet crisis response and potential natural disaster requirements. The subcommittee's jurisdiction includes $82 billion in Department of Defense procurement and research and development in Titles I and II and another $20 billion in Title XV, for overseas contingency operations.We have made nearly $3 billion in reallocations within the Subcommittee, funding higher priority current requirements, using funds from programs with excessive unexpended balances, delayed execution, and excessive cost growth.Our Subcommittee increased the unfunded requirements of the Army and Air Force by over $1 billion by reallocating funding from these lower priority projects. The mark also provides an additional $603 million for procurement and research and development of the F136 competitive engine for the F-35 aircraft program. This is largely offset by rebalancing within the F-35 program, by reducing procurement from 32 to 30 aircraft.Nearly $2.7 billion is authorized for 176 Apache, Kiowa, Black Hawk, and Chinook helicopters and an additional $1.2 billion is provided for helicopter modifications. Our bill:Fully funds elements of the Future Combat Systems program that will continue in some form, at $2.55 billion;Provides $2.5 billion for new and upgraded Army ground combat vehicles;Provides $263 million for research and development of future Army ground combat vehicle upgrades and improvements; andProvides $600 million for National Guard and Reserve Equipment, above and beyond what is in the budget request.The change by the National Guard to an operational reserve status, coincident with a reorganization of the Army, has greatly increased the amount of equipment Guard and Reserve units are required to have. While the Department is making improvements and progress in providing improved funding to equip the National Guard and Reserve to enhance its role as an operational reserve, there are a significant number of units that do not have their required equipment.Given the operational reserve equipage model, a large percentage of nondeployed Army National Guard units are far below Army standards for equipment on hand. Without the right type and amounts of equipment, even the most dedicated and experienced soldier or airman cannot train for combat, or provide adequate assistance when there is a domestic emergency.The committee continues to work on improving intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, known as ISR capabilities, as well as improving counter improvised explosive device technology, vehicle armor, body armor, and helmet protection. Like many other mission areas in the Department of Defense, there is no apparent nexus for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance joint strategy, requirements coordination, acquisition or deployment focus, where a single lead organization is responsible.An example that can be cited is the unplanned and expensive proliferation of dissimilar ISR platforms all seeking to provide the same capability.Coalition forces control the skies in both theaters and has the world's best ISR technology, but does not use this advantage to full advantage.The Department still fails to provide joint ISR employment plans for both Iraq and Afghanistan. This bill directs the Department to assess the current use of ISR systems in Iraq and Afghanistan and make recommendations on how to more effectively coordinate and use all the systems we have deployed and plan to deploy.The committee has in the past directed the Department to define joint ISR requirements and develop a long-term strategic plan to make informed acquisition decisions to meet ISR goals. That continues to be a work in progress.It is widely reported that our soldiers in Afghanistan routinely carry loads of 130 to 150 lbs for a 3-day mission. Personnel can only wear so much armor, beyond which their operational effectiveness is inhibited, which in turn increases their risk of being injured. Two provisions in our bill require the Secretary of Defense, beginning with the fiscal year 2011 budget request, to establish research and development program elements and procurement budget line items for the development and acquisition of body armor and personnel protection enhancements.The language also strongly encourages the Secretary of Defense to consider establishing a DOD-wide Task Force on par with the MRAP Vehicle Task Force to promote weight reduction initiatives for body armor.The bill fully funds the President's request of approximately $700 million for body armor.With regard to the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle program, over 16,000 vehicles have been produced in just over two years. Approximately 15,000 vehicles have been fielded and these vehicles continue to save lives daily. Almost $26.0 billion has been provided by Congress for this program.This bill fully funds the President's request of $5.45 billion for MRAP category vehicles. The request procures approximately 1,000 MRAP All-Terrain Vehicles, a lighter weight version of the current MRAP Vehicle, to be used in Afghanistan. The request also provides operation, maintenance, and sustainment funding as well as necessary funds to address home-station training requirements.The bill provides $5.25 billion for light, medium, and heavy tactical wheeled vehicles or ``Humvees'' and ``trucks.'' This funding keeps the industrial base operating at high levels of production and will help address shortfalls in the Guard and Reserve components. In closing, I again want to thank my distinguished chairman and ranking member of the full committee and our subcommittee.H.R. 2647 is deserving of a ``yes'' vote from every Member of this body.",

    "title": "DISABLED MILITARY RETIREE RELIEF ACT OF 2009",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2990, the Disabled Military Retiree Relief Act of 2009. This important legislation will finally address the issue of concurrent receipt, as well as other significant issues that plague public employees. One key issue affecting federal employees in Hawaii is the long-awaited transition from a Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) to locality pay, as is currently used on the mainland United States.Equitable retirement pay for federal employees outside the contiguous 48 states is a concern shared by the approximately 50,000 civil servants living in Alaska, Hawaii and the U.S. territories. The current cost of living adjustment (COLA) provided to federal employees outside the continental United States has created a retirement inequity between them and their mainland counterparts. If federal service in non-contiguous areas is seen as a detriment to future financial security, our government will have an increasingly difficult time attracting and retaining the very best personnel. Further, federal workers should not have to resort to completing their final years of service on the mainland just to earn adequate retirement pay.I think this bill is an important step in addressing the inequality between those serving in the continental United States and those in more remote locations, such as Alaska, Hawaii and the territories. Federal employees throughout the nation are making an equal contribution to the health, well-being and security of our nation. Regardless of where they live, they deserve equal treatment and should not be penalized in their retirement for choosing to contribute to the local communities outside the 48 contiguous states.I believe that all federal employees will be better off under this bill than under the COLA system because their entire pay will now be counted toward their retirement benefits. Moreover, with COLA rates scheduled to decrease for many locations this year, and territories such as American Samoa receiving none, now is the time to act.Please join me in supporting H.R. 2990 and ensuring retirement equity for all federal employees regardless of their location.",

    "title": "CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2009",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to address an issue raised by my colleagues regarding Hawaii's Keiki Care program as a reason not to expand SCHIP. It was suggested earlier today that the Keiki (meaning ``child'') Care program was cancelled due to perceived crowd-out, a situation where parents drop their children's private insurance in order to enroll into a free government program.I have supported the State Legislature's efforts to expand health care coverage for children and followed the implementation of Keiki Care closely. The statements made about a crowd-out problem leading to the program's demise were baseless. The Keiki Care program had no problems with crowd-out. First of all, it was intentionally designed to prevent such behavior in requiring that children who wish to enroll must be uninsured continuously for 6 months. Secondly, if parents were indeed hoping to drop their insurance and wait 6 months to enroll, then Keiki Care would have seen a spike in enrollment. Blue Cross Blue Shield Hawaii, the health insurance provider for Keiki Care, did not see any spikes in enrollment and have no evidence to believe crowd-out occurred.Furthermore, there was little incentive for parents to switch to the Keiki Care program from any private health plan. The health insurance plan offered under Keiki Care was basic preventative care. This means that parents would have had to pay for expanded care costs out of pocket. In looking closer at the Keiki Care program, it is evident that a parent with a full coverage plan for their child would have no incentive to drop a private insurance for this basic, prevention-centered plan.The State Administration has given various explanations regarding the decision to end Keiki Care, including a growing budget deficit. However, the facts about the program are clear. There was never a problem regarding crowd-out and if continued, the program would have helped to cover more of Hawaii's uninsured children. Therefore, Madam Speaker, it is my hope that by clarifying the details regarding Keiki Care, it will no longer be used as a rationale that has no basis in fact against SCHIP or other efforts to expand health insurance to children and the uninsured.",

However, the federal government currently does not provide any financial assistance to states to pay for the care of these individuals through such programs as Medicaid or SCHIP.

    "text": "Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Doc. My regard for you and for all of the Members is, of course, something that, I trust, is understood by all. I see my good friend Don Young there as well.Mr. Speaker, this bill is an enabling bill. It establishes a process. The core of this bill assures that a Native Hawaiian Government has the same powers and sovereign immunity as other native governments, and this is consistent with the history of the legal discussions and court cases that have taken place over such a long period of time. Since the passage of the bill in the Resources Committee, we have had 2 months of discussions with the Hawaii State Attorney General. As a result, we have made numerous changes in the substitute amendment, and have added several pages of new text to make the State more comfortable with how a native government interacts with the State government.This is, in fact, my amendment, and I wanted to assure the minority on the floor--I don't think there is a minority here. Doc is quite right. It's not a question of Republican versus Democrat or majority versus minority. It is a question of perspective as to what is appropriate with regard to Native Hawaiians and other native people and how they establish relationships both with local governments and State governments in the United States of America.So this has not been something behind closed doors. Quite the opposite. It has been a full and complete discussion with the Governor and with the Attorney General, and I think that is reflected in the Governor's statement.In conversation with Governor Lingle today, we concluded that we would agree to disagree. As Representative Hastings has indicated, she continues to support the legislative object of the bill, and I want to assure the House that her administration will not be disadvantaged in any way in any negotiations undertaken upon the passage and signing of this bill.As a candidate for Governor myself, I am completely comfortable with the language of the substitute, and believe that no Governor, regardless of who it may be, will be disadvantaged. The substitute amendment treats a Native Hawaiian entity as any other native government, and it follows literally centuries of existing Native American law.Native Hawaiians are not a race. They are a native indigenous people of the United States. The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that legislation enacted to address the special concerns and conditions of native people of the United States does not constitute discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity. The sovereign status of Indian tribes, recognized by the Constitution, was later extended to Alaska natives as indigenous people, and Representative Young can attest to that in his remarks. On this same basis then, Congress has enacted legislation on multiple occasions for the aboriginal, indigenous people of Hawaii.Absent the substitute, H.R. 2314 would unduly limit the power of the Native Hawaiian governing entity, upon recognition, to accomplish the ordinary and customary activities of any other native organization, such as providing for the welfare of their children or for the health care of its members. The substitute amendment then will ensure that the Native Hawaiian governing entity will have the same powers and authorities that other tribal governments exercise today.The Native Hawaiian Government will have sovereign immunity, as I indicated, the same as other native governments--no more, no less. This is not a new provision. Under the bill passed by the House in the last Congress, the Native Hawaiian governing entity would also have had sovereign immunity once it had been federally recognized.In support of this bill are the Congressional Delegation of Hawaii, the National Congress of American Indians, the Alaska Federation of Natives, et cetera, et cetera. The Native American Caucus, under Representatives Kildee and Cole, as caucus Chairs, are supportive as are the Native Hawaiian organizations, such as the Sovereign Council of Hawaiian Homestead Organizations, the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. Local political leaders in both houses of the legislature and numerous resolutions from both of those bodies are in support.",

National Congress ofDear Honorable Members: The National Congress of American Indians fully supports the Native Hawaiian people in their quest for self-determination and self-governance, and has for many years. (See NCAI Resolution PHX-03-004.) This week, the Native Hawaiian Reorganization Act of 2009 (H.R. 2314) is expected to be amended on the floor of the House of Representatives and subsequently passed through Congress. NCAI supports the amendment as a way to ensure that Congress has a strong basis for treating Native Hawaiians as a distinct native community, and that the Act is constitutionally sound. Through the deliberative process with the Department of Justice, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and with legal scholars with expertise in federal Indian policy, Representative Abercrombie's amendment has addressed these concerns. NCAI has demonstrated repeated commitment to Native Hawaiian self-governance and sovereignty. Over the past ten years, we have passed resolutions and steadfastly supported legislation encouraging the formation of a Native Hawaiian governing entity. NCAI supports Representative Abercrombie's proposed amendment to grant Native Hawaiians the self- determination and self-government they justly deserve.

Known as an astute businessman in the world of finance, Mr. Miller is president and CEO the Delta Funding Corp., a company dealing primarily with the origination, purchase, and servicing of nonconforming residential mortgage loans. Indeed, the industry has looked to Mr. Miller for leadership, and he has served in that capacity as a representative of the National Home Equity Mortgage Association, National Mortgage Brokers Association, Executive Enterprises, American Community Bankers, Information Management Network, and Mortgage Bankers Association of America.Yet despite the ongoing demands on his time and talents, Hugh Miller has vigorously and effectively undertaken a myriad of social responsibilities. Many diverse organizations including the National Kidney Foundation, Police Conference of New York and Nassau County, DARE, the American Cancer Society, the Leukemia Society of America, Hofstra University Scholarship Funds, and the Huntington's Disease Society of America have greatly benefited from his service. His experience in this regard has emerged as a yardstick by which all such future dedication is measured. Furthermore, in conjunction with the Interfaith Nutritional Network, Delta Funding has created the Delta Funding Inn, which caters to the needs of disadvantaged youths.Mr. Speaker, in a time when we search for heroes and leaders, it is most reassuring to know that people such as Hugh Miller are tirelessly striving for the betterment of society.

    "title": "CONDEMN BOMBINGS IN ISRAEL",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in stong support of House Concurrent Resolution 149, which condemns the bombings in Israel, and in solidarity with the people and Government of Israel. This recent spate of bombings was a series of heinous and cowardly acts, perpetrated by elements of the Palestinian society that have been rejected by the majority of Palestinians, and completely reviled by the international community.During this period of grief and mourning by Israelis and Jews the world over, I am pleased to see that we can all come together like this, in bipartisan fashion, to speak against these acts of evil, and support the Israeli people in their efforts to combat terrorism. However, we are faced with a complex question: How can we best combat the evil of terrorism, as it continues to indiscriminately victimize the people of Israel? I think the appropriate follow-up to that would be: How do we then fight this evil effectively, without completely derailing the peace process? That to me is a quandary, but it's one that I think is not completely unsolvable.In fact, I think we've seen some recent steps that would lead us to believe that we're in the best position, since the beginning of the process, to resolve this human tragedy of gigantic proportions. It has finally become apparent to the international community that we are all linked in a common struggle; a struggle to eradicate terror from the face of this planet. Without a doubt, we all have a vested interest in fighting the spread of terrorism, and that is why I welcomed last week's Summit of Peacemakers in Cairo as a positive step in that direction.The importance of forging as broad a coalition as possible to repel these enemies of peace can not be emphasized enough. It no longer suffices to have world condemnation, we must have world action as well. We have avoided this issue long enough; and in our interdependent and inextricably linked international community, we can no longer afford to do so. However, we must also take careful note: we are not attacking Islam, or the Moslem community--we are attacking terrorism, and terrorism has no religion. We are, in sum, fighting against the enemies of peace, and that fight transcends all ethnic and national borders.We have all, in effect, partaken in a momentous and irreversible process. We can not be deterred from continuing on. As Hasan Abd Al-Rahman, chief representative of the Palestinian Authority in Washington, said in a statement to a recent International Relations Committee hearing on the commitments made by the Palestinians to the peace process: ``It's the struggle between those who have placed their lot with peace and those who seek its death.'' Therefore, I urge all my colleagues to continue to work together, to be vigilant, and to have faith that we can overcome these recent tragedies. Otherwise, the dark forces poised against us can claim their greatest victory.",

    "title": "INDIAN AMERICANS DOMINATE U.S. HOTEL INDUSTRY",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I call to the attention of my colleagues an article entitled ``Hospitality is Their Business, Indian-Americans' Rooms-to-Riches Success Story.'' This article appeared in the business section of today's New York Times.Mr. Speaker, as this article correctly points out, Indian Americans are now the dominant force in the domestic hotel industry. Today, Indian Americans own 12,000 hotel and motel properties. This translates into 46 percent of America's economy hotels and 26 percent of the United States total lodging. This is truly an amazing and impressive accomplishment.Mr. Speaker, Congress is in the midst of a long and protracted debate on how to reform our Nation's immigration laws. Many of my colleagues have endorsed the idea of sharply reducing the number of legal immigrants to this country as part of this overhaul of our immigration policies. I believe that any Member who reads this article will have to seriously question and ultimately reject that proposal. We are a nation of immigrants. Immigrants have built this country into the economic powerhouse of the Western World. Indian Americans are one of our country's most visible success stories. As Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at Pepperdine University, stated in the article, ``These Indians are modern Horatio Algers.''Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to closely review this important article. I know my colleagues join me in saluting the Indian American community on its speculator success in the hotel industry. We need more entrepreneurs such as the Indian Americans described in this article who are willing to become self-sufficient, productive, and profitable members of our society.In the quarter-century that people of Indian ancestry have been emigrating to the United States in sizable numbers, they have carved out a steadily bigger share of the nation's hotel industry. Starting with no-name motels, they soon graduated to Days Inn, Econo Lodge, Rodeway and other economy franchises. Today, with more than 12,000 properties, Indian-Americans own 46 percent of America's economy hotels and 26 percent of the nation's total 45,000 lodgings. ``We used to be isolated in a few states in the South,'' said Ravi Patel, whose Charlotte, N.C., company, Sree Inc., owns 20 hotels. ``Now we're almost everywhere.'' They are also moving up. A new generation is buying properties like Sheratons, Radissons and Hiltons, adding an upscale chapter to an immigrant success story. The first wave of motel ownership was propelled by the Indian-Americans' strong family ties, close-knit communities and a willingness to invest years of sweat. This latest wave represents a break with tradition and a willingness to tackle bigger, more complex challenges. But the original community still provides the backing, as today's entrepreneurs pool the resources of extended families and borrow from fellow Indian- Americans, for whom a handshake is often sufficient collateral. ``These Indians are modern Horatio Algers,'' said Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at the Pepperdine University Institute for Public Policy in Malibu, Calif. ``They're willing to start in marginal and sometimes risky areas that native-born Americans are not interested in going into, and working incredibly long hours.'' Ramesh Gokal, who bought a 26-room hotel in North Carolina soon after coming to the United States in 1976, is now president of Knights Inn, a chain of about 180 franchised economy hotels. Children of the industry pioneers are establishing their own companies and using newly acquired knowledge of capital markets to build budding empires. ``My parents' generation did business by having x dollars, buying y goods and selling for z,'' said Karim Alibhai, the kinetic 32-year-old president and chief executive of Gencom American Hospitality, a family-owned hotel group in Houston. ``At the roadside hotels they ran, the management philosophy was get guests in and out, and have the maids clean the rooms.'' But these days, ``you have to know administration, management and how to use Wall Street to invest and to grow,'' added Mr. Alibhai, who was born in Kenya and majored in economics at Rice University. (Many Indian-American hotelkeepers came to America by way of Africa, where their families had lived for several generations in many cases.) In Mr. Alibhai's case, the big plans are not just talk. In September, he co-sponsored a $350 million initial public offering of a real estate investment trust, one of the largest in United States history. Paine Webber was the lead investment banker and Mr. Alibhai was initially the biggest individual shareholder. Today Gencom affiliates, which began with a single Best Western that Mr. Alibhai's parents bought in 1979 after emigrating from Kenya, own all or part of 47 hotels in 13 states. Properties include the 759-room Radisson New Orleans, the 650-room Sheraton Astrodome in Houston as well as Marriotts, Hiltons and boutique hotels in Boston and San Antonio. Revenues are expected to exceed $200 million this year. Like his parents, Mr. Alibhai said, he ``worked the desk, drove the shuttle van to the airport and learned to fix the sewer plant.'' In the three years after finishing college in 1984, years in which the Houston hotel industry bled red ink, he still did odd jobs at the hotel, but spent most of his time learning the business. ``Operating during that recession was my M.B.A.,'' said Mr. Alibhai, a trim, tennis-playing executive whose office is in a sleek Houston high-rise. In 1987, with the economy looking up but hotel values still down, Mr. Alibhai began buying distressed properties, often jointly with other Indian- Americans. ``That's when the real learning process began,'' he said, ``not just acquiring the properties but convincing lenders who had tightened their purse strings to finance me. I had to change their perception of Indians as being identified with low-end hotels.'' In many ways, Mr. Alibhai's world of revenue streams, variable inflation rates for assessing potential purchases and structuring deals with investment bankers is alien to the generation of his 60-year-old father, Akber, who is in charge of purchasing for Gencom. ``The older generation is still very cautious about sharing information, like the cost of hotels,'' said Jay Patel of Colorado Springs, a 43-year-old native of Zimbabwe who is part owner of seven hotels in Colorado and California. ``The younger generation is much more forthcoming.'' There are other differences. ``When you come from India and Africa, your view of labor is very different,'' Mr. Alibhai said. ``People are thankful just to have a job. That's their bonus. Here, employees also want to feel appreciated. I prefer this system.'' Most of Gencom's corporate employees are given stock or bonuses, he said. In the early years, Indian-Americans had problems typical of many newcomers in trying to get financing and insurance. By their account, insurers in the early 1980's suddenly canceled property insurance to all Indian hotel owners, believing them to be part of an Indian conspiracy to buy properties and burn them down to collect insurance money. ``We were turned down by about 200 insurance companies, until we convinced underwriters that these immigrants were outstanding risks,'' said Ron Thomas, a vice president of United Insurance Agencies in Muncie, Ind., who is widely admired by Indian hotel owners for his early efforts on their behalf. Discrimination also took other forms, including boasts by rivals that their properties were ``American owned.'' Much of the more blatant bias began to wane with the formation of an Indian hotel owners' association in 1989, vigorously supported by Henry R. Silverman, the chairman of HFS Inc., and Michael A. Leven, then president of Days Inn. Starting with about 100 members, the group now numbers more than 4,000 hotel-keepers. ``Indian franchisees have been the engine of growth for the entire economy-hotel sector,'' said Mr. Silverman, whose company's franchises include Days Inn, Knights Inn and Super 8. ``They were willing to build with their own capital when no one else was willing to.'' For all their success, though, Indian-Americans have stayed away from luxury hotels and five-star resorts, and often from full-service hotels, mainly because of their cost but also for cultural and religious reasons. ``Most Indian hotel owners here are Hindus from Gujarat state and don't do well with anything involving alcohol and meat,'' said Mr. Patel of Colorado Springs. (Most Hindus from the western state of Gujarat are vegetarians, according to the Indian Embassy in Washington, and most Gujarati women do not drink.) But younger Indians feel differently. ``They realize you can offer meat and alcohol to your guests, because it's all part of the hotel business,'' Mr. Patel added. ``Within the next five years you'll see a lot of us owning luxury properties, like Ritz-Carltons,'' said Tushar Patel, the 31-year-old president of Tarsadia Hotels in Costa Mesa, Calif. About half of Tarsadia's 13 properties--including the 440-room Clarion Hotel at the San Francisco airport--are full-service hotels, with restaurants and bars. Tushar Patel, by the way, is not related to Jay Patel of Colorado Springs, unless distantly, or to most of the thousands of other Patels who own hotels in the United States. Almost all Patels, even those from Africa, trace their ancestry to Gujarat, where hospitality is highly regarded. In the United States, many Indian immigrants turned to lodging because they could buy cheap motels, they could live rent free and the family could work the front desk, clean rooms, do laundry and make repairs. When they stepped up to franchised properties, for as little as $20,000 plus 8 percent of revenues, the Indians acquired not only toll-free reservation systems and the benefit of bulk purchases, but an education about prices, payrolls and bookkeeping. ``We'll soon have eight hotels and we're looking to open a 200-room one soon, and it's no big deal,'' said S. Jay (you guessed it) Patel of Alpharetta, GA. ``Now we're experienced enough to know we can handle it.'' His father, J.K. Patel, left a 10-year career with Barclays Bank in Kenya to come to America in 1978, spending six months looking for a business before buying a hotel in South Carolina. The elder Mr. Patel attributes the Indians' success in this country to ``the way we were brought up.'' Parents instilled the need for education and trust between families and among their own ethnic group. ``In January I did a deal with an Indian partner in Dallas for two hotels,'' said Mr. Alibhai of Gencom. ``We shook hands, and before the contracts were signed I wired him several million dollars.'' Arvind Patel, who with his wife, Bhavna, owns a 39-room Days Inn in West Point, Miss., cites another factor--the willingness of extended families and acquaintances to provide financial help. ``We work together as a team,'' said Arvind Patel, a native of Tanzania. ``A lot of families give you $10,000, even $30,000, without charging you interest and without any collateral. They figure one day you may help them.'' But like many Indians, these Patels are branching out and moving up, building an 81-room Wingate Inn and a 58-room Hampton Inn elsewhere in Mississippi. Meantime, both continue working a full shift each day behind the desk of their Days Inn, with their 12-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter pitching in on weekends. ``And if our help doesn't show up,'' Mrs. Patel said, ``my husband and I still clean the rooms.'' Many of the older Indian-Owned motels were long ago refurbished, if only to measure up as franchises--a method the Indians quickly saw as a route to financial independence. Some properties have been kept for the next generation, but most have been sold to a newer wave of Indian immigrants. When Indian-Americans graduate from college, many have chosen to become doctors, engineers, lawyers and accountants. ``But in most families at least one son or daughter will become hoteliers, because they realize it isn't the hard work it was for us,'' said J.K. Patel, the former Barclays banker. ``The difference is, we used to man the desk ourselves. The new generation likes sitting in the office and delegating the work.''",

I find that difficult to believe.Mr. Speaker, when President Bush banned the importation of assault weapons in 1989, the number of such rifles traced to crime dropped by 45 percent.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with my colleagues and the members of Temple Emanuel of Great Neck, as they gather on May 5, 1996, in Temple Emanual to celebrate Emanuel Day, the end of a 10-year effort that has served to beautify the synagogue, and enhance it as an ongoing source of inspiration to its congregants and the Great Neck community. Conceived by Rabbi Robert Widom, spiritual leader of Temple Israel, the project evolved into the design of six stained glass windows for the synagogue's sanctuary, a new ark and eternal light. The initial project, under the direction of Rabbi Widom, undertook a search that would last for 10 years until the appropriate artist was selected and the creative plans were developed.An extensive search by the rabbi and the congregation's refurbishing committee yielded Paul Winthrop Wood, a Canadian born artist, who comes from a family of renowned architects and builders. Mr. Wood brought to Temple Emanuel an innate understanding of the Old Testament and the many creative and imaginative themes that flow from it. It was his early upbringing by his mother that endowed him with a rich blend of talent and insight that would be brought to fruition by the many religious building challenges he undertook.A native of Port Washington, Mr. Wood continues the family tradition of building and design. He began his early studies in the Art Studies League and the National Academy of Design. Soon thereafter, he founded his own school, and began a career that would include the design and construction of more than 100 churches and synagogues throughout the United States and 30 houses of worship on Long Island.In rising to the challenge of bringing to the synagogue and sense of love, understanding, and compassion, Mr. Wood succeeded grandly. It is with great pride and love that the trustees of Temple Emanuel of Great Neck have declared Sunday, May 5, as Emanuel Day. As the hundreds of congregants of Temple Emanuel gather on this day, it is most exciting and reaffirming that in the truest tradition of the American spirit, this beautiful congregation continues to so willingly give of itself, to its members and the community.",

Recognizing the importance of technological development in Israel's future, Ros and Joe have been long time supporters of Technion, Israel's only comprehensive scientific university and center for applied research. In this vein, they have provided funding for Technion's Gurwin-I Tech-Sat satellite, a project stimulating telecommunications, meteorology and x-ray telescope technology, as well as serving as a key link in an Israeli-based computer network.However, Mr. Speaker, Ros and Joe's philanthropic efforts extend far beyond Technion to encompass the entire New York metropolitan community. The Long Island Jewish Medical Center and UJA-Federation have benefitted greatly due to their continuing support. Furthermore, Ros and Joe's commitment to the elderly has led to the construction of the Gurwin Jewish Geriatric Center in Commack, Long Island.Mr. Speaker, the Gurwins have come to symbolize the American spirit of volunteerism and generosity.

The Memorial Association recognizes individuals who pay tribute to educational and social projects that express the lifelong philosophy and personal commitments of Harry Van Arsdale, Jr., the long time, and much beloved labor leader.Throughout his life, Joe Jacobson has strived to help others. In 1921, Mr. Jacobson was initiated into the Local 3, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. From there he held a position on the Board of Directors of the Electrical Workers Benefit Society. He has served as president to the Electrical Welfare Club, and the Bronx Acorn Social Club. Mr. Jacobson was also a representative of Local 3, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and an employee representative of the Joint Industry Board of the Electrical Industry, and of the vacation committee.While becoming active in the community, he still remained a loving husband to his late wife Rose, and a father to his son Stanley, who has blessed the Jacobsons with three grandchildren and one great-grandson.This is not the first time Mr. Jacobson has been honored with such prestigious recognition. Mr. Jacobson's accomplishments were also acknowledged by the Electrical Industry Division of the State of Israel Bonds, the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of the Electrical Sign Division, and the United Jewish Appeal and the Bronx Council of Scouting.The dedication of this man to better his community continued even after his retirement on March 1, 1967. He was instrumental in organizing the thirteen chapters of the Retirees Association of Local 3, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. He served as their first treasurer in 1969, and has served as president since 1975, while continuing to remain a board member on the National Council of Senior Citizens. He still remains active in his community, always putting others before himself. There is no doubt in my mind that this country would benefit by having more people like Joseph Jacobson.Mr. Speaker, it is with the utmost sincerity and gratitude, that I pay tribute to this man, and thank him for the generosity he has proffered on others throughout his life. He is an outstanding citizen and an inspiration to us all. Therefore, I ask my colleagues to rise with me, and the people of the Fifth Congressional District, as we extend to Joseph Jacobson our sincere appreciation for his life's work and dedication to others.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today so that this body may take note of a very special organization in my district--the Queens Borough Public Library. This organization celebrates the anniversary of its founding this year. I wish to congratulate them and offer my voice in support of their tireless efforts to educate and serve the residents of Queens Borough.As I have told many of you before, Queens is a very special place to me and to those who live there. Its nearly two million residents make up the most ethnically diverse community in the United States. For years, the face of Queens has been the face of the many cultures of the world.In that vein, the Queens Library system reaches out to this microcosm of the American mosaic and provides not just books, but citizenship education classes, English as a second language [ESL] classes, job training, and access to the information superhighway. In fact, the Queens Library offers over 18,000 programs to the community at large. Sixty-three facilities scattered throughout the borough are wellsprings of learning from which the community benefits.On top of all this, the Queens Library is adding an international resource center [IRC] to the redesigned Flushing Branch, which will enable it to showcase many of the cultures reflected in the borough population. Using the latest technology, this unique facility will provide cultural background, business information, and educational materials on the varied peoples of the world.With its expanded facilities, the Queens Library will be able to host even more high quality exhibitions. For example, last year, it presented an excellent exhibit with support from the National Endowment for the Humanities [NEH] on Lewis Latimer, a 19th-century inventor, and on Korean-style printing with movable metal type--a technique perfected in Asia well before Gutenberg and his printing press. Many of my colleagues know that I have had a longstanding interest in the Asian region, and therefore, I am delighted Queens is becoming an increasingly recognized center of Asian commerce in the United States. I wholeheartedly applaud the Queens Library for its diligent efforts and foresight in this regard.For a hundred years, the Queens Library has nurtured the community, supplying its needs for information and community services. As it heads into its next hundred years, I wish them the best, and look forward to the new developments it will surely bring.",

    "title": "HONORING AMERICAN WORKING MEN AND WOMEN",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today, to commemorate our Nation's Labor Day holiday, and to honor New York's vibrant and diverse work force. Appropriately enough, before Congress adjourns, we will have passed a bill to raise the minimum wage and sent it to the President for his signature. This marks a tremendous victory for those people who have been working tirelessly to ensure that this vital, and long overdue, action be taken. Many people deserve praise for their work on this and other issues, but I would especially like to recognize the New York State AFL-CIO, the Long Island Central Labor Council, the New York Central Labor Council, and the Building and Construction Trades Union of the AFL-CIO, as well as all of you in the labor community who have united to work together against the antilabor sentiment that has pervaded Congress in the last 18 months. Your immeasurable support in this effort has assisted Congress in finally, after 7 years, passing a much-needed raise in our Nation's minimum wage, as well as staving off several vitriolic attacks on our Nation's workers.In a short time, those workers who have been scraping by on $4.25 an hour will get some relief for their families by earning a little bit more. Right now, the minimum wage is at 40-year low in terms of purchasing power. The simple fact is that people can no longer raise a family on this kind of wage. Yes, it's a small step, but it's no secret that it's a step that most Americans have desired for a long time. In fact, 80 percent of the American public supports this raise. Additionally, this legislation is the essence of family values--in other words, by enacting this measure, we are truly valuing our families. In my view, it is a simple matter. If we don't assist, nurture, and encourage our families to attain a higher standard of living, how do we expect America as a whole to succeed?Howeer, this labor-unfriendly majority has, for some time now, been a virtual roadblock in the way of achieving meaningful legislation such as this, as well as other important labor and family related matters. We need to continue to be in the business of improving, not undercutting, the well being, and survival, of our families. Nonetheless, whether its been in the form of striker-replacement legislation, allowing companies to raid the pensions of its workers, crafting a bill to mandate employer-led organizations to address labor issues, or cutting funding for important agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA] and the National Labor Relations Board [NLRB], the Republican leadership has strived to make it more difficult for American workers to have access to safety and security in their jobs. These actions do not send the right message to hardworking Americans, and I intend to ensure that trend is reversed.Lastly, through the persistent efforts of those such as my colleague Senator Ted Kennedy, we are also able to pass a serious first step toward meaningful health insurance reform. This bill will affect at least 25 million Americans who either change or lose their jobs, or have preexisting conditions in their family that has, up until now, given insurance companies an excuse not to offer comprehensive health insurance. That is patently unfair and just plain wrong, and I have consistently made sure that these concerns are addressed properly.Working men and women have been the glue of this country ever since its inception, and I heartily salute them on Labor Day 1996. I strongly urge my colleagues to commemorate with me the workers of New York and their families on this day, and I look forward to a time when all Americans can feel safe in their jobs and financially secure in their lives.",

In both of these areas, he was enormously successful.Ambassador Ray and his embassy effectively publicized the importance of the Indian market to American business. It was during Ambassador Ray's tenure that the United States Secretary of Commerce led a high level business delegation to India.Ambassador Ray was equally effective in helping to curtail the South Asian arms race by effectively arguing against the administration's plan to transfer advanced fighter aircraft to Pakistan.Siddhartha and his delightful wife Maya were an extraordinary team in Washington. They came to this post after distinguished careers in law and government. Siddhartha came to understand the workings of the U.S. Congress as only a former Member of Parliament could.I join my colleagues in wishing Siddhartha and Maya Ray the very best of luck in their future endeavors, and we hope to see them back in Washington often.",

He, like many other courageous young soldiers, landed on Omaha Beach in Normandy, France on D-day, June 6, 1944. Five campaigns later, the war ended for him just outside of Berlin, Germany and 1 year later was discharged from military service.After the war, he settled in Suffolk County, and began working at the Kings Park State Hospital in charge of 85 patients during the evening shift. It was here that he began his efforts to improve the quality of life of the patients and the employees. He effected such changes as improved patient-staff ratio, upward mobility through career ladders, and a higher level of training opportunities. In 1975, Greg founded the Kings Park Employees Federal Credit Union and served as the union's president until 1996.Throughout his career, he formed many civic groups and became extremely active in local civic affairs. His involvement with the union as an advocate and organizer led him to many positions on the local, regional, and statewide levels where he could continue to work for the good of all.Since his retirement in 1988, Greg has continued to stay fully involved in civic affairs. He serves as the facilitator for the Northwest Civic Coalition and the Suffolk Community Alliance, whose membership includes all the major civic coalitions in Suffolk County.Greg is truly one of Kings Park's treasures and has been a driving force in ensuring that Kings Park is a better place to live in.I ask my colleagues to join with me in saluting Gregory Szurnicki who has provided a lifetime of service to his country and his community, and in congratulating him on being named the 1996 Man of the Year by the Kings Park Chamber of Commerce.",

    "title": "NAZI SS MEMBERS IN THE UNITED STATES",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring a very serious and troubling affair to the attention of my colleagues. Several news reports, over the last couple of days, have uncovered an incredible story: The German Government is giving pensions to over 3,000 former members of the Nazi Waffen SS Corps, living in the United States. Not extraordinary in and of itself, because these men receive their pensions as a result of their military service during World War II, yet the question that begs answering is: How many of these individuals might be war criminals? The outrage in this matter, is that the German Government may never have bothered to check.At this same time, there are many Holocaust survivors--Catholics, Jews, and others living in the United States and elsewhere in the world--who have received very little in the way of compensation, and even scores of surviving victims who do not receive anything from the German Government. After the horrors and suffering they were forced to endure during the war, how can we allow this additional measure of indignation?Apparently, many of these former SS members were able to enter the United States, and eventually gain citizenship, by falsifying their identities and lying about their wartime activities. Many of them, however, have been living in the United States for years now, some boldly with the same names, the same identities, the same blood on their hands.Mr. Speaker, there is no excuse for that, and it is simply unacceptable. Yesterday, I sent letters to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President Clinton, and Attorney General Janet Reno, asking that they obtain the names of these Nazi pensioners, and release them to the proper American Government agencies, in order to fully investigate the possibility of war criminals in our midst. There must be a full accounting. Yes, many of them are old, frail men, who have lived peacefully in their respective neighborhoods for decades. Did they show the same respect for the millions in Europe who also were old, frail, and living their lives peacefully? I think we all know the answer to that question.Thanks to the hard work of the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations, as well as some other prominent organizations, we are beginning to uncover a trail of Nazi war criminals among us. In fact, the OSI is finding and prosecuting Nazis at the rate of one per month. It is imperative therefore, that we have all the necessary information at our disposal, so that we can continue to bring these murderers to justice. They have eluded the authorities, and the moral outrage of their deeds, for over 50 years now, but we will no longer allow that to continue. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in this endeavor, so that we may finally honor the memories of the Nazis' victims. Everyday, more and more Holocaust survivors leave this Earth, while their former tormentors continue to live on, having never been held accountable for the horrible deeds of the past. It's simply time to act now. Therefore, I call on the Government of Germany to work with us in addressing and resolving this issue once and for all--for the survivors, for the victims, and for the future. They need to do the right thing.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against religious intolerance in Pakistan. Earlier this month, tens of thousands of Muslims angered by the alleged desecration of a Koran, and incited by local Muslim leaders, burned thousands of homes of Christian villagers, along with a hospital, a school, a Catholic church, and a dormitory. While this event by itself is despicable, the conduct of the local police in this affair is unforgivable. According to reports, local police actually told residents to leave their homes because they could not protect them from the mobs. Yet it took only a small army unit to halt the rampage, which destroyed shops and homes, and restore order to the village.This is only the latest incident in what the Christian Voice of Pakistan reports is ongoing persecution of Christians by Muslims in Pakistan. The State Department's ``Human Rights Report on Pakistan'' points out that ``Discriminatory religious legislation has encouraged an atmosphere of religious intolerance.'' In fact, section 295(c) of the Penal Code stipulates the death penalty for blaspheming the Prophet Mohammed. This provision has been used by Muslims to intimidate religious minorities in Pakistan.I met yesterday with the Pakistani Charge d'Affaires to ask the Pakistani Government to launch an immediate investigation of the incident with particular emphasis on the role of the local police, and to repeal those portions of the Penal Code which give license to Muslims to persecute Christians and other religious minorities.Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in calling on Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to speak out against religious discrimination and to work to create a climate of tolerance and religious harmony in Pakistan.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that, despite the hectic and trend-setting legislative pace, we have found the time today to take up House Concurrent Resolution 17 to congratulate the people of Guatemala on the establishment of the peace process for that nation.After 36 years of civil war, Guatemala has finally had a chance for a lasting peace. The URNG has agreed to demobilize and in fact the first URNG combatants are entering demobilization camps this week. The Guatemalan military has agreed to reduce its size by one-third, and the United States has pledged $265 million over 4 years for reconstruction.Even before the signing of the peace accords, the human rights situation in Guatemala had improved dramatically as a result of the cessation of hostilities last March. The government of President Arzu has moved aggressively to restructure the military command by reducing the number of general officers from 23 to 8 and removing those officers alleged to be involved in corruption or other abuses. But there is still a long way to go.Guatemala continues to suffer from a marked disparity in income distribution, and poverty is pervasive. According to AID, 75 percent of Guatemala's population live in poverty. Only 48 percent of its adults are literate, and its infant mortality rate is among the highest in Latin America.Yet despite of all this, or perhaps because of it, Guatemalans have chosen peace and democracy. They are to be congratulated for that choice.Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my colleague and chairman [Mr. Gallegly] for his great leadership in this area and for introducing this resolution, to our chairman [Mr. Gilman] for his stewardship, and for our ranking member [Mr. Hamilton] for his hard work on this resolution.

With 3 years of economic growth, peace, and stability, the people of Nicaragua chose a candidate who emphasized economic reform and private sector-led growth as key planks in his platform. Nevertheless, President Aleman has his work cut out for him.Nicaragua continues to have a precarious balance-of-payment position and is heavily dependent upon foreign assistance. Although the economy has grown recently, the country remains very poor, with a per capita income of $470 per year.Strengthening the rule of law was a campaign theme of the President, and he inherits a court system that has become a bottleneck as problems of crime and property disputes have proliferated. It is imperative for Nicaragua to address this question if foreign investors are to have any confidence in Nicaragua's future.The United States and other donors have provided $4 billion to Nicaragua since 1990, and for the coming fiscal year USAID has requested an additional $22 million to deepen and expand the economic reforms and enhance the legitimacy of civil institutions.The international community must continue to work with the Nicaraguans to help them along the path to prosperity. I believe, Mr. Speaker, that this resolution will provide a measure of moral support to Nicaraguans and encourage them to continue on the road that they have chosen.Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate my colleague from New York [Mr. Houghton] for sponsoring this resolution and his hard work and diligence in this area of the world; and also the gentleman from California [Mr. Gallegly], our chairman on the subcommittee, for putting this legislation through our body; as well as the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman], the chairman of the full committee; and the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Hamilton], who serves as our leader on this side.I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.",

Born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, Julia and Buddy Farrell were married at the church they had both grown up attending, Nativity Church, on June 7, 1947. On this Saturday, April 12, over 125 of their friends and family will honor them at a surprise party to celebrate their anniversary.Before marrying Julia, Buddy proudly served his country in the U.S. Marines. Shortly after their marriage, they moved to Queens, NY, where they raised their five children, Terri, Joan, Kathy, John, and Timmy. In 1964, their niece, Noreen, from County Kerry, Ireland, joined their family here in America.Julia and Buddy were very active in St. Nicholas of Tolentine parish. Julia headed the ``milk mothers,'' organized the majorettes, helped with the sports association, and volunteered in the gym. Buddy, who worked as a police officer with the New York City Police Department, also was involved in the Holy Name Society and the homeless shelter. Julia and Buddy are known to everyone for their giving natures and always reaching out to help their friends and family.After working very hard and raising a wonderful family, they are living the good life in retirement in the condo in Leisure Village in Ridge, NY. Julia and Buddy are very proud of their children and adore their 12 grandchildren, Tricia, Maryellen, Danny, Kevin, John, Bridget, Casey, Erin, Matthew, Colin, Elizabeth, and Christopher, who range in age from 4 months to 25 years old. Julia and Buddy enjoy the company of many friends, playing golf, and swimming. In the winter, they go south to Florida, and in the summer, they spend time in Brant Lake, NY.Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to rise with me today in honoring Julia and Buddy Farrell on 50 years of marriage, and in wishing them many more years of happiness together.",

I raise the question, who is being protected by this law, convicted felons, or law abiding citizens?Each year since fiscal year 1993 we in Congress have stopped funding this guns for convicted felons program. However, this is insufficient, because as the law is still on the books, even unfunded, felons can go to court and regain their firearm privileges.To stop this from happening, we should eliminate the guns for convicted felons program outright.Today, along with the gentlewoman from Maryland [Mrs. Morella] and the gentlewoman from New York [Mrs. McCarthy], I am introducing the Stop Arming Felons Act, or the SAFE Act. The Ackerman-Morella-McCarthy legislation will eliminate guns for convicted felons altogether. It sends a clear message that we should make it harder, not easier, for criminals to have access to weapons.The Stop Arming Felons Act is bipartisan and has 32 original cosponsors, and I urge all of my colleagues to act in the interest of this country and let us stop arming convicted felons.",

    "title": "PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 54, PROHIBITING THE PHYSICAL DESECRATION OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, our Founding Fathers must be very puzzled looking down on us today; and instead of seeing us dealing with the very real challenges that face our Nation, they see us laboring under this great compulsion to amend the document that underpins our democracy and trying to give this Congress a great new power at the expense of the people, the power for the first time to stifle dissent. The threat must be great, they must be saying, to justify changing the Bill of Rights for the first time and decreasing, rather than increasing, the rights of the people.And what is the threat? Is our democracy at risk? What is the crisis in the Republic? What is the challenge to our way of life? Where is our belief system threatened? Are people jumping from behind parked cars waving burning flags at us trying to prevent us from going to work? Trying to grind America to a halt? Do we really believe that we are under such a siege because of a few loose cannons? Need we change the Constitution to save our democracy?The real threat is not the occasional burning of a flag but the permanent banning of the burners. The real threat is that some of us have now mistaken the flag for a religious icon to be worshipped rather than the symbol of our freedom that is to be cherished. Rather than allowing someone to insult them by demeaning the flag, they would diminish our Constitution.These rare but vile acts of desecration that have been cited by those who propose changing our founding document do not threaten anybody. If a jerk burns a flag, America is not threatened, democracy is not under siege, freedom is not at risk and we are not threatened, my colleagues; we are offended. And to change the Constitution because someone offends us is in itself unconscionable.The Nazis, Mr. Speaker, the Nazis and fascists and the imperial Japanese army combined, could not diminish the rights of even one single American; and yet in an act of cowardice, Mr. Speaker, we are about to do what they could not.Where are the patriots? What ever happened to fighting to the death for somebody's right to disagree? We now choose instead to react by taking away the right to protest. Even a despicable low-life social malcontent has a right to disagree, and he has a right to disagree in an obnoxious fashion if he wishes. That is the test of free expression, and we are about to fail that test.Real patriots choose freedom over symbolism. That is the ultimate contest between substance and form. Why does the flag need protecting? Burning one flag or burning a thousand flags does not destroy it. It is a symbol. But change one word of our living Constitution of this great Nation, and it and we will never be the same. We cannot destroy a symbol. Yes, people burn the flag, but, Mr. Speaker, there it is again, right in back. It goes on. It cannot be destroyed. It represents our beliefs.Now, poets and patriots will tell us that men have died for the flag. But that language itself is symbolic. People do not die for symbols. They fight and they die for freedom. They fight and they die for democracy. They fight and they die for values. To fight and die for the flag means to fight and die for the cause.Let us remind ourselves we did not enter World War II because the Japanese sunk a bunch of our flags. There happened to have been ships filled with men tied to the other end of those flagpoles, and our way of life was threatened.We love and we honor and we respect our flag for what it represents. It is different from all other flags. And I notice we do not make it illegal to burn some other country's flags, and that is because our flag is different. No, it is not different because of its shape; they are all basically the same. And it is not different because of its design; they are all similar. And no, not because of the colors. Many have the same colors. Our flag is unique only because it represents our unique values, it represents tolerance for dissent. This country was founded by dissenters that others found obnoxious.And what is a dissenter? In this case it is a social protestor who feels so strongly about an issue that one would stoop so low as to try to get under our skin and to try to rile us up to prove his point, and have us react by making this great Nation less than it was. And how are we going to react?Dictatorships crack down on people who burn their nation's flags, not democracies. We tolerate dissent and dissenters, even despicable dissenters.What is the flag, the American flag? Yes, it is a piece of cloth. It is red, white, and blue with 50 stars and 13 stripes. But what if we pass this amendment and desecrators make flags with 55 stars and burn them? Will we rush to amend our law again? And if they add a stripe or two and set it ablaze, and it surely looks like our flag, but is it? Do we rush in and count the stripes before determining whether or not we have been constitutionally insulted? And what if the stripes are orange instead of red? What mischief are we doing? If it is a full-size color picture of the flag they burn, is it a crime to desecrate a symbol of a symbol? What are we doing?Our beloved flag represents a great nation, Mr. Speaker. We love our flag because there is a great republic for which it stands made great by a Constitution that we want to protect, a Constitution given to our care by giants and about to be nibbled to death by dwarfs.Mr. Speaker, I call upon the patriots of the House to rise and defend the Constitution, resist the temptation to drape ourselves in the flag and hold sacred the Bill of Rights. Defend our Constitution and defeat this amendment.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with my constituents and the students and faculty of SUNY College at Old Westbury, NY, as they honor Mina Barrett for outstanding professional and public service. Dr. Barrett was born in New York City in 1948 and at a very early age established her academic credentials. She was an honor student at Oceanside High School and received her graduate and undergraduate degrees at the State University of New York at Stony Brook in the field of psychology.In 1975, Dr. Barrett came to SUNY College at Old Westbury and became one of the founders of the Psychology Department. Rising to the position of associate professor, Dr. Barrett immediately became active on a variety of academic committees. Yet to the great benefit of both the academic and general communities of the greater New York metropolitan area, Dr. Barrett embarked upon a course of community service that would serve as a model for effective community activism.Recognized for her deep understanding of the human mind, Dr. Barrett was appointed as a Red Cross Disaster mental health psychologist and became codirector of the Nassau County Chapter of the Red Cross for mental health. It was in 1994 that she was called upon by the city of Los Angeles to serve in an assisting office in the city's tragic earthquake. For her service rendered to the city of Los Angeles she received the Henri Dunant Humanitarian Award. Her services were again utilized by the residents of Long Island in 1994 during the east end fires for which she received a service citation. During the tragic crash of TWA flight 800, she served as coordinator of mental health, rescue and relief working 18 hours a day training and directing health teams.Mr. Speaker, Dr. Barrett's activities in human relations and women's issues have given her an international reputation. I ask my colleagues to join with me and rise to salute Dr. Mina Barrett for her devotion and for all she has done to enhance our world.",

    "title": "COMMENDING ROGER TILLES' LEADERSHIP ON THE NEA",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to commend Mr. Roger Tilles on his insightful and provocative op-ed piece on the National Endowment for the Arts, which was recently published in the New York Times. Mr. Tilles, who is the former President of Temple Beth-el of Great Neck, has worked from the private sector to further the cultural enrichment of the Long Island community. With generous support from the Tilles family, Long Island University created the Tilles Center which has been vital in educating students about the arts, and bringing world class cultural exhibits and performances to Long Island. His following op-ed piece recognizes the unique partnership that exists between the private sector and the NEA. When voting on the NEA, we should look to Mr. Tilles' example, and recognize that public funding for the arts, and private sector philanthropy go hand in hand.As efforts are mounted to scrap the National Endowment for the Arts, there is no small irony that among the reasons why Long Island is now among the top 20 places to live in the nation is its quality of life, best reflected in the broad scope of cultural and performing arts programs that are now at serious risk. In the global battle for economic investment, local corporations seeking to entice new industries, jobs and capital to our region offset our high taxes and congested highways by using the arts as an attractive inducement. And with the bicounty region now deeply dependent on tourism, some 25 million people who visit Long Island annually now seek out our 12 dance companies, 40 arts organizations, 46 museums, 80 music companies, 30 theater companies and countless art galleries. Far more than the loss of artistic outlets, shutting down the N.E.A. would have a direct, profound and negative impact on Long Island's economy. Without the small stipend many of these artistic programs receive from the National Endowment for the Arts, the vast majority of these cultural attractions would whither and disappear. The battle over the N.E.A. has its roots in the fierce partisan battles that have erupted in Congress over the last several years. Whether it is dollars earmarked for Ernie the Muppet or Ernie the Artist, N.E.A. support is now considered a political litmus by the Congressional leadership. It is as if a performance of Mozart, an exhibit of de Kooning or a performance of ``Swan Lake'' are now battlegrounds for the hearts and minds of the electorate. This is treacherous ground because, for those with a sense of history, there is a faint echo from a not so distant past when a fascist government used the arts to sanitize their murderous regime. To prevent plans from moving ahead to dismantle the National Endowment of the Arts, Long Island, with its population of nearly three million people, is going to have to become far more millitant on behalf of the arts. It should not be unfamiliar territory. As we shifted public policy on issues relating to breast cancer and the environment, we need to take those lessons and apply them to this equally crucial task. Our first step should be the mobilization of those individuals who have served in the past as potent financial and ideological supporters of either major political parties. It will be a powerful message indeed if both Republican and Democratic standard-bearers discover that their core constituencies are united behind a common theme--protection of the arts. We need to condition our support based on where public officials stand as it relates to the arts and their support for the National Endowment. In addition, because of Long Island's financial depth, many of us are targeted by political action committees and campaigns far outside Long Island. We need to include the arts as part of our personal platform for contributions. Elected officials from Maine to California need to know that their support of N.E.A. programs is a critical factor in our determination of whether they are worthy of our dollars. We also need to network with those cultural and performing arts organizations working in Congressional districts where opponents of the arts endowment are located so that our message is carried far beyond the Long Island Expressway. That can be accomplished by becoming more involved with the artistic organizations that currently exist in the bicounty region. As the Long Island Congressional delegation once led the charge to fund locally built weapons systems that defeated our Cold War opponents, let them now use their debating skills to protect the performances, programs and exhibits that now nurture the human spirit and enhance our region's economic and social quality of life. We need only demonstrate our personal leadership to insure that our elected officials pretend that Chopin is a weapons system and vote accordingly.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.Mr. Chairman, the previous speaker, the gentleman from Indiana, asked the question, who will speak for the people who are the victims of violence in Punjab and Kashmir and other places. Let me assure the gentleman that I do and we all do because we decry violence and we decry the abuses of human beings anywhere for any reason. But what the gentleman seeks to do is to punish an entire nation, the largest democracy in the world collectively, for random acts of a few that take place. He brings us one picture and cites hundreds of thousands. How do we condemn a whole nation because of that? That is nothing but India bashing, Mr. Chairman. Do we condemn our own Government because people put a bounty on people's heads in Arizona and people moved in and murdered them? Is that the fault of the whole American Government and the American people?I would like to cite an article that appeared in the Hill newspaper. It is a quote by a gentleman of the House who shows an unbelievable amount of understanding when talking about the Government of Turkey and he says, ``When you have military conflicts,'' and the gentleman here is talking about insurgencies taking place against existing governments, he says, ``When you have military conflicts, you're bound to have unfortunate things happen,'' he said. Continuing the quote, ``People get killed, they're bombed and shot. These things happen,'' he said understandingly and justified, ``incidental and anecdotal things that happen during these times of conflict.'' Who was the gentleman who said that, so understanding of the Government of Turkey? It is the very same gentleman from Indiana who just took the well and offered this amendment. How can he justify it in the case of one country and oppose it when it comes to another country?The gentleman offers up four amendments. Dr. Alukh mysteriously appears in the Halls of the House, in the gallery, it happens each and every time, and the India bashing begins. This, Mr. Chairman, is totally unacceptable. This is not the way two great democracies view each other or treat each other. The gentleman complains of human rights abuses, but he ignores the genuine progress that India has made on this question. According to the State Department report which he only quotes in part, it says ``India made further progress in resolving human rights problems.'' The same report notes that newspapers and magazines ``regularly publish investigative reports and allegations of government wrongdoing, and the press as a whole champions human rights and criticizes'' whenever there is a government lapse. Beyond this, the Indian Government has appointed a National Human Rights Commission with powers to investigate and to recommend policy changes and punishment and compensation in cases of incidental police abuse wherever it might happen to take place. Again in the State Department report that the gentleman quoted only in part, ``The NHRC continued to enlarge its useful role in addressing the patterns of abuse, as well as specific abuses.''In particular, the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Burton] is concerned about human rights in the states of Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. Last year there was an election in Punjab where 65 percent of the eligible voters turned out in a Sikh-dominated government. This is the very minority that the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Burton] claims the Indian Government oppresses. There were also elections in Kashmir which restored elected government there for the first time in 6 years.I think, Mr. Chairman, what we have discovered, with the unwitting help of the gentleman from Indiana, is that India is a fully functioning, mature democracy with a free press, with civilian control of the military, with an independent judiciary, and very active political parties and civic associations. It seems to me that the oldest democracy in the world should not be sanctioning the largest. That is not the way democracies treat each other.In addition to India's thriving democratic institutions, the current united front government led by Prime Minister Gudjaral has pledged, as has the finance minister with whom the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman] and myself met with only a week ago, has pledged to continue the economic reforms of the past 6 years. These reforms have provided enormous opportunities for United States business and, in fact, the United States is now India's largest overseas investor, its biggest trading partner and its preferred source of high-technology.Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a deliberate and specific attempt to stigmatize India at a point where the relationship between the world's two great democracies has flowered. I urge all of my colleagues to stand and to defeat this amendment.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, many of our colleagues may already know the deeply troubling situation that exists in the United States with regard to the veterans of the Nazi war machine.About 8 months ago I discovered that thousands of former soldiers from Hitler's elite Waffen-S.S. corps, now living all around the world, some of whom may have participated in crimes against humanity, have been receiving monthly pensions from the German Government. These fairly generous pensions called, ironically enough, war victims' pensions, are given to Nazi SS officers who sustained injuries during World War II.However, my concern lies with the fact that neither the German Government nor any other government has ever bothered to cross-check the list of applicants and recipients with the international list of known Nazi war criminals. This is unacceptable, particularly since we have learned that at least 3,300 recipients of these Nazi pensions live right here in the United States.The situation becomes ironically intolerable when we realize that according to the American Jewish Committee, which has done a tremendous job in working on this issue, that well over 15,000 Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, and probably at least as many non-Jewish survivors living in Eastern Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union, have never received any compensation from that government for the horrors they were forced to endure in Nazi ghettos and concentration camps.These survivors have been dubbed the ``double victims,'' as they were first victimized by the Nazi nightmare and then again by the Communist governments that took over after the war. Perhaps we need to call them ``triple victims'' at this point since they are once again being victimized by a government who continuously refuses to offer them any compensation. Many of these survivors are also in desperate financial straits as well as in poor health.Based on the information we received regarding the issue of pensions to former Nazi Waffen-SS officers, I wrote to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl requesting that he send us the list of those living in the United States so that the Office of Special Investigations in our State Department and in our Department of Justice could do the necessary cross-checking before the trail to Nazi war criminals grows cold.To the credit of Chancellor Kohl and the German people, he quickly acceded to the request, and our Office of Special Investigations, OSI, under the superb leadership of its Director, Eli Rosenbaum, is currently poring over these lists.Let me also stress that the work that they are doing now is extremely slow and a very tedious and laborious process. OSI continues to be undermanned and underresourced, and this additional major surprise project further strains those capabilities.Therefore, this amendment would simply add $300,000 to the Justice Department appropriation for the specific purposes of investigating the names on the lists that the German Government has provided us. I think this is a prudent and reasonable amendment, and I have been informed by the Director of OSI that this additional appropriation would allow them to hire the needed attorneys and historians in order to complete this list project effectively and efficiently and in a timely manner.",

Few policy decisions will have a more significant impact on our environment and the safety of our communities than this bill before us today. High-level waste is a daunting responsibility which must be afforded the most stringent and thorough deliberation. The determination to transport nuclear waste through 43 States, affecting 52 million people, should not be mandated by political motivations. The potential cost, in terms of the loss of life and the impact on our environment is too great to dictate arbitrary deadlines. If the scientific community is not yet prepared to support the political rhetoric coming from this floor, how can we feel qualified to preempt their authority and expertise?When we in Congress fail to meet our deadlines on appropriations bills, we pass a continuing resolution, and extend the time afforded us to pass informed legislation. With the passage of H.R. 1270, we will be directing the Department of Energy to abide by a deadline which they are not adequately prepared to implement. By doing so, we will endanger our environment and the constituents of almost every Member in this House. As conscientious legislators, we must grant the Department of Energy the same latitude to make informed decisions that we allow ourselves. To do anything less would be the ultimate form of hypocrisy.The scientific feasibility of the Yucca Mountain site has not yet been determined, and when every significant environmental and citizen organization is in opposition to this bill, we must at least acknowledge that there are serious concerns which have not been adequately addressed. In good conscience there is simply no way we can place this deadly material in untested canisters and ship it on poorly maintained railways, through ill prepared and unaware communities, until every issue is resolved and every precaution is taken.

    "title": "ANNETTE LANTOS PAYS TRIBUTE TO RAOUL WALLENBERG",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, Annette Lantos, the wife of our colleague Congressman Tom Lantos of California has been a leading advocate for the Hungarian Holocaust hero, Raoul Wallenberg. Well before her husband was elected to Congress, Annette had established the International Free Wallenberg Committee to press Soviet authorities to release the Swedish humanitarian from prison. Much of the credit for bringing the tragic plight of Wallenberg to international and particularly to American consciousness has been the result of her work.On February 8, Mr. Speaker, Annette Lantos delivered a Tribute to Raoul Wallenberg at a special meeting of the Sydney Australia, chapter of WIZO (Women's International Zionist Organization), the non-party voluntary charitable women's organization which is similar to the organization Hadassah here in the United States. I have received reports of her exceptional presentation, and I ask that her recent address be placed in the Record.Fifty-four years ago, on March 19, 1944, as the Nazi's campaign of terror and genocide finally overtook our native land of Hungary, a young idealistic Swede made his way to Budapest to interpose his own frail body between the Nazi war machine and the persecuted, unarmed thousands facing deportation and annihilation in Auschwitz. By the time Raoul Wallenberg arrived to Budapest, 500,000 Jews from the Hungarian countryside had already been taken to Auschwitz where most perished. But Raoul Wallenberg's arrival to Budapest delayed the execution of the death sentence upon the remaining 300,000 Jews of the cities long enough to enable some 100,000 of them--including my husband Tom and myself--to survive. It is on their behalf, and behalf of their children and their grandchildren that my husband, Tom, and I have dedicated many years of our lives to make Wallenberg's story known, and to honor this great man. When I began my work for Wallenberg in 1975, I had two goals in mind. First and foremost, I wanted to free him from the horrors of the Gulag where he was languishing--by that time for over 30 years. The second goal was to make Raoul Wallenberg's life and accomplishments penetrate the consciousness of mankind and to inspire all those who are touched by his story to become better, more unselfish, more caring human beings, willing to transcend the barriers of race, religion, or nationality in their concern for others. Raoul Wallenberg taught us two major things. First, he taught us that a single individual committed to a noble goal can achieve miracles. Second, he taught us that human rights are indivisible, that it is not enough just to be concerned simply with our own human rights. As Jews or Catholics, Australians of Hungarians or Americans, the only relevant concern for human rights that deserves respect is a concern that transcends religion and race and color and national origin. Raoul Wallenberg did not go to Budapest in 1944 to save Lutheran Swedes. He went there to save Hungarian Jews, with whom he had nothing in common except his common humanity. Raoul Wallenberg not only fought evil, but he also fought indifference, and indifference is the twin of evil. Those who kill are murderers, but those who stand by and do nothing in the face of murder share a complicity in crime. Wallenberg's message was loud and clear. We must fight evil, but just as hard we must fight indifference. Most of you have heard the story of Wallenberg. He started out issuing Swedish passports to all who managed to reach him at the Swedish legation in Budapest. He brilliantly negotiated with the Nazis and later the Arrow Cross gangsters (Hungarian Fascists) who ran Hungary in the final few months of the German occupation, until they recognized the validity of these fictional documents and exempted their owners from deportation and having to wear the yellow star. He bought or leased 32 large apartment houses and succeeded in declaring them Swedish territory in Hungary. Thousands of people were crowded into these protected houses, many of whom he brought back personally from the forced marches heading toward the death camps. He rushed the saved persons to the protected Swedish houses in Budapest. He even brought people back from the railroad cars, pulling them out of deportation trains, and from the banks of the Danube river. He interposed his own body between the fallen victims and the machine guns that were leveled at them by the Arrow Cross guards. When the Russians finally liberated Budapest in January 1945, he believed he was finally safe, and went to their headquarters to report and ask for food and medicine for the surviving victims. The Soviets didn't believe his story. They were convinced that he was an American spy. They kidnaped him on January 17, 1945, and he languished in the Soviet Gulag until 1981, when I personally believe that he finally died still in a Soviet prison. Even today, people ask me whether I think Raoul Wallenberg still lives. I personally do not believe that he is physically alive anymore, but I do believe that in the spiritual sense Wallenberg is more alive than most of us who are still around living our ordinary, day-to-day lives. He is more alive than most of us, because of what he has done. He not only saved lives, but he saved our faith in humanity. He continues every day to touch the lives of thousands of young people the world over, who, hearing or reading his story, testify that they have been inspired to become better human beings and to dedicate themselves to fight for the right of others who are still persecuted and oppressed all over the world. I would like to share with you tonight the writing of one of these young people who has been inspired by Wallenberg. The letter I am about to read to you was written by my granddaughter Chelsea Swett at age 10, on the occasion of the dedication of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC. This truly magnificent museum, a considerable portion of which was paid for by successful Holocaust survivors in America, is not only a memorial to honor those who were consumed in the flames of the Holocaust, but it is intended as a warning to future generations of Americans of the consequences of unbridled racism, religious intolerance and national hatreds. The exhibits at the Holocaust Museum not only highlight the brutality and callous disregard for human life, but they also reflect the occasional heroic willingness of non-Jews to risk their lives in order to save another fellow human being. I am also very grateful that we succeeded in passing an Act of Congress to rename the street upon which the U.S. Holocaust Museum is located as Raoul Wallenberg Place. It is most significant that in addition to the permanent exhibition at the museum there is a special exhibit entitled ``Remember the Children,'' which commemorates the more than one million children who died in the Holocaust. This special exhibit also provides a presentation aimed at children so that they can understand the experience of children who suffered in the Holocaust. It is in connection with the special exhibit ``Remember the Children'' on the occasion of the dedication of the U.S. Holocaust Museum that my granddaughter Chelsea read the following letter:",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, House Concurrent Resolution 222 commends the Organization of American States for its role in successfully aiding the transition of Nicaragua from Civil War to democracy.Mr. Speaker, the OAS role in Nicaragua has proven to be invaluable. The international support and verification commission has resettled former combatants; distributed food and humanitarian assistance; and investigated and documented human rights abuses. In addition, the OAS-CIAV brokered negotiations between the Government of Nicaragua and the rearmed groups; provided critically needed infrastructure; and established local peace commissions to provide an avenue for alternative dispute resolution.Clearly, Santiago Murray and Sergio Caramagna are to be commended for their work as are all the members of the OAS-CIAV team and the follow-on OAS technical cooperation mission. These dedicated professionals have labored long and hard to ease the journey as Nicaragua consolidates its democracy.I want to thank and commend the chairman for introducing the resolution and I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my strong support for the Watts, Moran, Thornberry Amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill. For too long, our nation's military retirees have been denied access to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP) even though they have devoted their entire lives to the defense and security of our nation. Most of these individuals entered the military on the premise that they would be entitled to comprehensive, quality health care for the rest of their lives. Unfortunately, our nation has not lived up to this important commitment.This amendment would create a demonstration program that would enroll 70,000 Medicare eligible members or former members of the armed forces into the FEHBP. The program would be available in six sites around the country. At the end of the project, the Secretary of Defense, and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management will analyze whether or not the demonstration yielded its intended results.Throughout my tenure is Congress, I have often spoken out in behalf of using the FEHBP to cover the underinsured and the uninsured. The FEHBP is financially sound and in most states, the program provides at least three quality benefit plans for its members. This the least we can do for our armed forces who have stood up to protect the rights and freedoms that we all cherish today. After a long fight, we have taken the first step toward providing comprehensive coverage for such brave and selfless individuals. It is my hope that this provision will remain in the conference report and will be signed into law by the President in the most timely manner possible. Our armed forces deserve nothing less.",

She is a dynamic and energetic individual, who will work tirelessly on behalf of the thousands of students in the New York City Public School System. Terri bagan working as a staff assistant in my Queens office when I served in the New York State Senate. I quickly became impressed with her work ethic, and her political savvy. Shortly after being elected to Congress in 1983, I promoted her to be my district administrator where she served with the utmost integrity and compassion until 1990. In this capacity, she made a difference in the lives of thousands of my constituents. Aside from being an invaluable political ally, she became the dearest of friends both to me and to my family.After leaving my office, she was hired by Citibank as the Director of Community Relations and was eventually promoted to be the Vice President of City and State Governmental Relations. At Citibank she helped school principals with professional training and worked to integrate new technology into the public school system. Moreover, she was able to introduce students to the Internet and demonstrated its application to commercial banking.Throughout her career, Terri has been deeply involved in the community. She also serves as the Vice Chair of the Brooklyn Sports Foundation, which seeks to create an indoor sports facility for the New York City Public School System. Terri has also been involved with the Queens Chamber of Commerce and the Queens Public Library where she sought to improve both economic and educational opportunities for the entire community.Terri's commitment to the community, her understanding of the issues, and her public and private sector experience make her uniquely qualified for a position on the New York City Board of Education. I am fully confident that she will be thoroughly equipped to grapple with the enormous complexities of the New York City Public School System. Thus, I ask all of my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in honoring this extraordinary individual whose dedication to the community will continue to make a significant difference in the lives of thousands of New Yorkers.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor RADM Thomas T. Matteson, USMS, who, on July 21, 1998, will retire from the position of Superintendent of the Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) after a total of 41 years of federal service to our nation.While others might have sought permanent retirement after 36 years of active duty in the Coast Guard, RADM Matteson chose to continue to serve America at the United States Merchant Marine Academy. RADM Matteson was on the bridge for five years navigating through perilous and uncharted waters. As he quickly became familiar with the dynamics of the vast maritime and intermodal transportation industry, he strove to ensure that the USMMA's program produced graduates that would serve America's global economic and defense needs.His time as Superintendent has not been easy. Early in his command he faced the possible closure of the Academy. Congressional action resolved this issue at the same time that RADM Matteson ensured the Academy received its ten-year accreditation. In addition, tight federal fiscal policy required good and sometimes creative stewardship to ensure the effects of level funding did not adversely impact the Academy's academic program.During his tenure at the Merchant Marine Academy, Admiral Matterson strove to create a better learning and personal environment for the midshipmen. His guiding hand enhanced the curriculum by creating the new Shipyard and Engineering Management, and Intermodal Transportation majors, and by planning the evolution of a trimester system. Along with his wife Dottie, RADM Matteson strengthened the bond between the Academy's leadership and the regiment by personally cooking hundreds of meals in his home for the future leaders of America, the academy's midshipmen.By traveling around the country to meet with the Academy's alumni body, RADM Matteson discussed the needs of the Academy and supported the need for the Alumni Associations Superintendents Campaign for Excellence, an endowment campaign to fund academic excellence, curriculum development, new technology and learning systems, and leadership training at the United States Merchant Marine Academy.Today, thanks to the devotion of RADM Matteson, the United States Merchant Marine Academy continues to be the most cost-effective federal academy, whose graduates serve our nation for many years beyond their required commitment. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to rise and join with me today in wishing RADM Matteson and his wife fair winds, following seas, a joyous retirement.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, let me thank the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Charlie Rangel), Dean of the New York delegation, ``Mr. New York,'' for bringing us together today. We share today, I think in the waning hours of the 105th Congress, another chapter in the American dream.A generation ago, Madam Speaker, Irish immigrants came here to these shores looking for a better way of life as young people seeking opportunity, as troubles brewed in their homeland of Ireland. One person was Peggy and the other one, Tom Manton. Tom came here, became a skilled laborer, married Peggy, got a job, and worked here in the capital of the free world. He was a tradesman, a plasterer, and he worked on the very buildings that we work and make our speeches in today.Little did Tom Manton from Ireland know at that time as he was applying his trade in these hallowed halls that one day his son would grow up to be a Member of the United States House of Representatives and work in the very building that he helped to build, in the land that with his hands he helped to build as well.Young Tom, when he was born, went to school in Queens, after being born in Manhattan. That was a wise choice, he came to Queens. He went to St. Joseph's Prep Elementary School. He went to St. John's Prep after that, and then he put himself through St. John's University and got a college degree. At the tender age of 19, still a teenager, he joined the Marine Corps and put in 3 years in the service, serving this Nation in Korea.After that, he became a New York City policeman, a tough job. We call them ``New York's Finest,'' and Tom epitomizes that. He certainly is one of New York's finest in every way and every aspect. As the Dean mentioned, he served a tour of duty while on the force on the job, as they say, on the beat in central Harlem, working with the people there.While he worked as a policeman in the City of New York, he put themselves through law school getting a degree from St. John's University during the night, a difficult thing to do while holding down a full-time job in the day.It was shortly after that that he ran for public office and was elected to the New York City Council and became the chairman of the powerful Housing Committee and served the citizens of our great city in that capacity for some 15 years with great distinction.Tom has always been a team player, but when it came time to being able to stand up for what he believed in, he was willing to step forward and rock the boat. He took on the establishment when it was necessary. He ran for the United States Congress and the rest, as we say, is history.He has been our good colleague now for 14 years. How time flies. For 14 years, he served with us in the House of Representatives, serving originally on the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, serving on what was then House Administration, Merchant Marine Committee, and the Committee on Commerce, handling such matters as trade and telecommunications and securities and consumer protection, working hard.Here in a place, Madam Speaker, known as a stable for show horses, Tom proved to be a workhorse. Recognized by all of us as a Member's Member, doing the day-to-day work that was necessary to make this place run, to make it easier for other Members to be able to do their jobs. Doing many jobs that many other Members of Congress would ordinarily shun.In addition to that, he quickly assumed responsibilities as the cochair of the Congressional Ad Hoc Committee on Irish Affairs, a cause, very, very dear to his heart, trying to argue the cause and work for peace with justice in the land of his ancestors. His work, along with that of many others, with his leadership, has begun to finally bear fruit. For that, I know that his dad, Tom, and mom, Peggy, who I know are looking down upon him today, would be very, very proud. It is hard for some of our Members to understand, because of his always friendly smile and congenial personality and attitude, working to build bridges with Members of both parties across both sides of the aisle, is that kind of a person. Yet at the same time, back home, I have to assure my colleagues he is a very partisan political player within the Democratic Party, fighting for the values that we all believe in on our side.A great leader, becoming the county leader of our Democratic Party for at least 12 years, taking the helm of our party in Queens County at a time when it previously had been racked with scandal and had many problems. He straightened out that county organization making it one of the proudest, cleanest, preeminent county parties in the State of New York. Always a person who is fair. Always a person we could count on. Always a person to step up to the plate and exert great leadership.Madam Speaker, I say this with a great deal of reverence and respect: We are losing in this Congress somebody who is one of the last of the old school Irish politicians from New York. He is a guy who will look you in the eye, give you his word, shake your hand and, you could count on the fact that he has been true and faithful to his word. His word is his bond, and we do not see a lot of that in politics too often these days.These are the days of ``blown-dry hair'' politicians, elbowing each other for time in front of the cameras, seeking publicity. Tom represents none of that. He is from the old school. He does the work quietly, behind the scenes, not looking to advance himself in other's eyes, but knowing that he is going to be doing the right thing.We are going to miss him down here in the Congress of the United States. It is going to be my privilege and pleasure, when I return back for weekends to my district which includes the County of Queens, to know that Tom is the county leader. After putting in all of these years, 14 in the Congress and 15 on the City Council, and a term in the Marines and all of that, he returns to private life after giving of himself, returning to his family that so graciously has shared him with us. To his wife Diane, to his children Catherine and Tom Junior and John and Jeanne, and all the grandchildren here and yet to come.We have been privileged to serve with the likes of Tom Manton in this Congress, Madam Speaker. He is a breed hard to find, a breath of fresh air reflecting the best of politics and the best that this system has to offer. I am happy to consider him my dear friend.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my congratulations to Amartya Sen who has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Science for his work on human rights, poverty and inequality.The Indian-born Professor Sen found an academically rigorous way to examine the impact that social policy choices have on rich and poor alike. His ground-breaking work on the 1943 Bengal famine has spawned extensive academic work on social choice and it's economic consequences. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences noted that Professor Sen's research had ``restored an ethnical dimension to the discussion of vital economic problems.'' Professor Sen himself said ``I believe that economic analysis has something to contribute to substantive ethics in the world in which we live.''Professor Sen was also influential in how international organizations deal with food crises. His 1981 book ``Poverty and Famine'' demonstrated that famine was an avoidable economic and political catastrophe and not just a consequence of nature. The United Nations drew heavily on Professor Sen's work in creating the U.N. Development Index which quantifies the quality of life in different countries by looking at such factors as longevity and school enrollment rather than simply examining per capita income.Professor Sen has restored a much needed discussion of values to the study of economics. His work can help us all understand the social consequences of economic choices and reminds us all that ultimately the quality of life is measured by more acquisitions.Mr. Speaker, as the new co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian-Americans, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Professor Sen for a lifetime of significant contributions to the study of economics and for being awarded the Nobel Prize.",

Through her extensive years as a volunteer, she served the PTA as its President, gave her time as Pink Lady at St. John's Hospital, and was appointed to the Small Business Advisory Council. Marcy is an alumna of the Citizens Police Academy, and a member of the Suffolk County Police Reserves. In addition, she has received the Distinguished Business Leaders Award from the March of Dimes.Since 1989, she embraced the challenge of Executive Director for the Hauppauge Industrial Association. Under her tenacious, caring and committed leadership, the membership has more than doubled.She has led this organization and its members into partnerships with outside agencies to establish programs that not only have proven beneficial to the HIA membership and their families, but also have enabled them to expand their companies nationally and globally. She is very proud of her membership involvement in HIA's 17 active committees and partnerships with schools, police departments, ambulance corps, and charitable organizations. Under her watchful eye, the HIA planted the seed for the nation's first intergenerational day care in an industrial park. She embarked on this venture in 1989, and with a handful of volunteers developed and realized her dream. Today, that day-care program has more than 100 participants.Concentrating on providing the best she could for the membership, she encouraged and convinced the Suffolk County Police Department to place a defibrillator in the Park's police sector car, and to establish a medical emergency police vehicle to provide immediate assistance to the victims of emergency situations in the Industrial Park.Marcy is a life-long resident of Long Island, where she lives today with Mark, her husband of 35 years. Her pride and joy are her two daughters: Ilyse, a Physical Therapist at South Side Hospital, and Beth, a health-care consultant for Price Waterhouse.A person is truly judged successful if she is able to bring about positive change that enhances and broadens the lives of others. Clearly, Marcy fulfills this notable standard.Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me now in saluting Marcy Tublisky for her outstanding leadership, creativity and commitment, and to extend our best wishes and congratulations as she is honored by the members of the Hauppauge Industrial Association.",

Through prudent economic policies that have kept foreign debt low and foreign exchange reserves high, Taiwan managed to post a 4.8% GDP growth rate last year.Mr. Speaker, the Taiwan Relations Act also speaks to the commitment of the United States to support Taiwan's Legitimate self-defense needs and recognizes that Taiwan's future must be decided by peaceful means only. The resolution before us today notes that cross-strait discussions are ongoing and urges the People's Republic of China to renounce the use of force as a means.Mr. Speaker, the Taiwan Relations Act has served the United States and Taiwan well as the policy framework that guides our relationship.

Quinn, joined the Suffolk County Democratic Committee and began his sojourn into local politics. At the same time, this Iona College graduate began his career as a teacher in the Middle Country School District, where he went on to become the principal of the unique school without walls, New Lane Elementary School. Joe retired from the Middle Country School District in 1988 after 28 years of outstanding career in education.Joe Quinn's dedication and loyalty to the Democratic Party is unsurpassed. Joe often boasts of the 22 officials that were elected under his leadership, ``one for every year as leader.'' He should take pride in that accomplishment, as those victories symbolized his commitment to the ideals of the Democratic Party and of our Nation.Mr. Speaker, on May 20, the Suffolk County Democratic Committee will honor and pay tribute to Joseph Quinn at a gala dinner.

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1000, the Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century.Th New York metropolitan area air space is the busiest in the nation. While many people enjoy the benefits of frequent flights into and out of New York, my constituents are forced to endure the noise of a plane landing or taking off every 30 seconds at LaGuardia Airport, as well as the pollution and traffic congestion. During the one minute that I will be speaking on the Floor, one plane will take off, and another plane will land at LaGuardia. If the High Density rule is lifted, the sky is literally the limit for the number of take-offs and landings that can be added to an already overcrowded LaGuardia and JFK airports.There is also a legitimate need for more flights and lower prices for airline travel to underserved markets. I am pleased that the Manager's Amendment strikes a reasonable compromise for both positions. In order to provide better service from underserved markets, regional jets will be exempt from the High Density Rule for service from LaGuardia or JFK Airports to nonhub or small hub airports, effective January 1, 2000. And, to protect those people who live, work and go to school in the areas near these airports, the High Density Rule will remain in place until January 1, 2000. And, to protect those people who live, work and go to school in the areas near these airports the high Density Rule will remain in place until January 1, 2007 for all other jet service.I am particularly proud to have worked with other Members of the New York, New Jersey, Connecticut tri-state area, particularly, Mr. Crowley, Mr. Meeks, Mr. Weiner, and Mrs. Maloney, in addition to the diligent work of the Transportation Committee, Chairman Shuster, Ranking Member Oberstar, Chairman Duncan, and Ranking Member Lipinski. Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to join us in supporting this amendment which is a win-win situation for all parties, and a major victory for the people of Queens and all of New York.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for H. Res. 211, which underscores our nation's support for prostate cancer research and testing. All too often, men and their families remain silent about this deadly disease, which will claim the lies of an estimated 37,000 individuals this year alone.It is critical that our nation starts to talk about prostate cancer in order to increase our awareness about early testing and treatment options. We in the Congress took an important step in fighting this condition by providing Medicare coverage for the prostate specific antigen blood test (PSA) and the digital rectal exam (DRE). I, along with a bipartisan group of House members recently urged HCFA to implement coverage for these procedures in the most timely manner possible. By providing this critical coverage, we can save the lives of thousands of men, while saving Medicare a substantial amount of funding.We can also provide real hope for the 180,000 men who are estimated to be diagnosed with prostate cancer by investing in research. We still have a long way to go before we really understand the risk factors associated with the disease. It is my hope that the National Institutes of Health and other Federal agencies will continue their groundbreaking research into this disease.I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this important resolution, which clearly states our commitment to treating and eventually curing this terrible disease.",

Kings Point's mission is to train young men and women to serve and to lead in our Merchant Marine, our Armed Forces, and in the transportation field.In times of peace, these Merchant Mariners contribute to our international trading prosperity. In times of war, it is the Merchant Mariners who enable our country to move troops and materiel anywhere, anytime.Despite rising costs over the years, the funding has remained nearly static for each of the last 5 years. The result of this level of funding is a real dollar budget cut for Kings Point. The 55-year-old infrastructure is in need of millions of dollars of capital maintenance repair projects.Included in these projects are barracks renovation, Y2K compliance requirements, maintenance of the 220-foot training vessel, the King's Pointer, instructional technology and training requirements, and improvements in waterfront renovation.Congress has already recognized the need for additional funds for the Merchant Marine Academy. In their report for the Defense Authorization Bill for fiscal year 1999, the House Committee on Armed Services said that they are ``concerned about the deteriorating material condition of the physical plant of the midshipmen barracks at the Merchant Marine Academy.''They go on to say, ``The plant is antiquated and in need of replacement before it becomes a health and safety concern to the midshipmen and the staff.''It is to this facility, Mr. Chairman, that, as Members of Congress, we nominate some of the finest young men and women so that they might study and become graduates of the academy. We must work to ensure that the academy is safe and conducive to this training.This funding for fiscal year 2000 will help it achieve this goal so that the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy can achieve their mission of providing our country with the highest quality Merchant Marine officers.I ask all of our colleagues to join with us in supporting this critical amendment.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 900, the Financial Services Modernization Bill. This is indeed a momentous day as we prepare to pass this historic legislation.S. 900 achieves many goals in financial modernization to better serve consumers and businesses. The measure creates one-step shopping for bank accounts, insurance policies and securities transactions, requires banks to disclose bank surcharges on ATM machines and on the screens of ATM machines before a transaction is made, and ensures that banks lend to all segments of their communities with the continued applicability of the Community Reinvestment Act.I was particularly proud to be a conferee on the financial privacy section of this bill. After months of negotiations, we have crafted, what I believe, is a strong provision which will enhance the privacy that consumers want and deserve. Four provisions in particular evidence the achievements in the bill.The first provision addresses disclosure requirements. Currently, financial institutions do not have to disclose their financial privacy provisions to their customers. Consumers have a right to know what the policy is, and S. 900 will require these institutions to inform all new customers of their policy and to update existing customers at least once a year.Second, the bill allows in most instances for consumers to ``opt-out'' of their financial institution's information sharing agreements with unaffiliated third parties. This arrangement strikes a balance between protecting consumer privacy and facilitating regular financial activities.Third, the measure expressly prohibits financial institutions including banks, savings and loans, credit unions, securities firms and insurance companies, from disclosing a customer's bank account or credit card numbers to unaffiliated third parties for telemarketing, direct mail marketing or electronic mail purposes.And finally, this legislation bans, with minor safety exceptions, the despicable practice known as pretext calling. This blatantly criminal activity in which an individual impersonates another in order to trick an institution into providing confidential information, would be punishable by both imprisonment and fines.I applaud the hard work and dedication of the Conferees from the House and the Senate, as well as the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the White House. Without this cooperation, we would not be here today voting on S. 900. I encourage my colleagues to join with me and vote for the Financial Services Modernization bill, S. 900.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise today to indicate my strong support on behalf of H.R. 1776, The American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act. This important bill opens the prospect of homeownership to many deserving American families, particularly in my area of Northeast Queens, northern Nassau County and Northwestern Suffolk County, New York where homeownership opportunities have lagged because of affordability concerns.Despite a strong economy and record percentages of Americans who own their own homes, in my district we continue to experience gaps in homeownership especially among our middle-income professionals--teachers, police officers, firefighters, and corrections officers. These deserving individuals have the necessary income to make their monthly mortgage payments but not enough cash for the downpayments necessary to purchase the home in the communities where they work.H.R. 1776 appropriately addresses this problem. The legislation contains important provisions that will now permit deserving Queens and Long Island teachers and public employees to obtain mortgages with just one percent downpayment requirement through the Federal Housing Administration. Plus, H.R. 1776 allows qualifying homebuyers to defer the payment of the upfront mortgage insurance premium--customarily two percent of the mortgage amount. As a result of these beneficial provisions, qualified borrowers can expect to save thousands of dollars in upfront costs when they purchase a home. I cannot begin to imagine how valuable the savings will mean for ownership in the Queens and Long Island areas as a result of H.R. 1776.Mr. Chairman, housing is the foundation on which everything else is built. In Queens and Long Island, homeownership holds many tangible benefits that range from increased educational attainment for children residing in an owned home to homeowners maintaining a more active interest and involvement in the communities in which they reside. H.R. 1776 certainly contributes to these important positive outcomes and I wholeheartedly urge my colleagues to vote in support of this important legislation.",

The Sound is one of our Nation's natural treasures with important environmental, recreational and commercial benefits. Its value as an essential habitat for one of the most diverse ecosystems in the Northeast cannot be understated. Residents and vacationers alike enjoy the Sound for swimming and boating, and the approximately $5 billion in revenue generated by commerce relating to the Sound is vital to the region as well as to individuals who base their livelihood on the benefits of the Long Island Sound.Unfortunately, the effects of millions of people on the shore and in the Sound are evidenced by the deteriorated water quality. Over the last several years, the Long Island Sound has suffered from numerous forms of pollution which has caused a dramatic drop in the Sound's fish population. As a result of the pollution, the Sound's multibillion dollar a year fishing industry is in jeopardy. The most recent devastating example that we have heard about is the unexplained and widespread lobster die-off. We must supply adequate resources to address this crisis and to examine possible problems in the water that could have caused the crisis.Preservation of the Long Island Sound is not a parochial issue but a national one. Its inclusion as a charter member in the National Estuaries Program, the Sound has been designated as one of only 28 estuaries of national significance. The time to act is now. When I first introduced this legislation by this name in 1992, and again in every subsequent Congress, the price tag was $50 million. Now it is $80 million. It will not get cheaper if we wait any longer.I am pleased to say and to note that both the States of New York and Connecticut are prepared to match the $80 million authorization with State funds, and I am confident that these funds will have a significant impact on the ongoing efforts to improve the quality of the Sound. We must do everything possible to ensure the continued funding of these efforts, and this legislation is the appropriate means for achieving the desired end. I urge all of our colleagues to join with us in supporting this legislation.",

It is with great pride that I pay tribute to two people who I have known closely, and with whom I have worked with on numerous issues critical to the Jewish community and beyond. Joseph and Chana Simckes have made the Jewish sage Hillel's ancient dictum, ``Do not separate yourself from the community,'' a living guide for their lives and the basis for their continuing efforts to promote social justice and human dignity from within and beyond the walls of the synagogue.Rabbi Simckes has been an exemplary spiritual leader, teaching Jewish values and providing moral guidance by his personal example, and I confidently expect that he will continue to be a source of leadership, learning and compassion for his congregation. Rabbi Simckes came to the Hollis Hills Jewish Center from a pulpit in Massachusetts and has been an energetic community leader in Jewish philanthropy, Jewish education and pro-Israel advocacy. Holding a doctorate in Pastoral Counseling, with experience in psycho-therapy, Rabbi Simckes has been a source of counsel and comfort for hundreds of my constituents, sharing his great wisdom and boundless compassion.Equally, Chana Simckes has won the hearts and respect of the Hollis Hills Jewish Center, and the larger Jewish community beyond, through her commitment and involvement in sustaining Jewish continuity and values. A refugee from Nazi Germany, Chana Simckes has embodied the American dream: graduating from Columbia University, succeeding as a professional in Jewish education, and rising to the leadership of numerous Jewish community organizations, all while raising a growing family.Joseph and Chana Simckes have elevated and improved the lives of their community, providing those around them with guidance, education, support and leadership. Stalwart advocates of social action, tireless champions of the Jewish people and the values of the Torah, I am honored to share with this House their marvelous example, and to hold them up for the recognition they both so richly deserve.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to rise in support of the Bonior-Campbell amendment, which is an absolutely necessary measure to root out an on-going government practice which should be offensive to all of us as sworn defenders of the Constitution.The very idea of ``secret evidence'' should alarm us as a nation that cherishes the rule of law. That our government, a government built on transparency and due process, should incarcerate people indefinitely and by executive fiat, and deprive them of the basis to defend themselves, is an affront to the Constitution.Our nation's justice system is a source of pride, not because of the efficiency of its operations, or its effectiveness in convicting the guilty, important as these things are. We are appropriately proud of our justice system because of its unyielding insistence on due process for the individual against the state; because of its strict adherence to Constitutional requirements necessary for government action and limitations on state authority. In criminal matters, before the federal government deprives anyone, citizen or non-citizen, of their right to life, liberty or property, the Constitution demands--demands, not requests, not suggests, not proposes--demands, that the government detail the charges to be prosecuted; produce its witnesses for cross-examination; provide compulsory means for the defense to obtain its own witnesses; and settle the matter of guilt or innocence by decision of a jury of ordinary citizens. This is the American standard of justice.Some will argue that detention and treatment of aliens is a category of government action apart from Constitutional mandates. I disagree. The Constitution is not to be considered mute as a matter of convenience. The actions of the executive branch are always bound by the strictures of the Constitution; there is no free-play zone for non-citizens.A decision by the Federal Government to deport, to grant asylum or residency, or to detain a non-citizen does not exist in some extra-Constitutional universe. The Executive Branch is not compelled by law to hold people on secret evidence. There is no legal obligation for the government to detain aliens indefinitely. If the state is concerned that judicial proceedings would require the disclosure of classified information to the detriment of the nation, the government always has the flexibility not to act. Prosecution is a political decision and is done at the discretion of the government's attorneys. Hard choices are part of life.It may be that precluding the use of secret evidence will lead to the release of some dangerous individuals. This is a regrettable but necessary price we must pay for a free society bound by the rule of law. Sometimes releasing the guilty or the dangerous is the unfortunate result of limited government. The threat of terrorism is real, and our government should do all it can to preempt and punish those who would do violence to our people and interests. But in doing so, we must not do harm to the Constitution, which is exactly what the use of secret evidence does.I urge my colleagues to support the Bonior-Campbell amendment.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to bring to the House's attention the 40th anniversary of the Korean-American Association of Greater New York, a community institution representing the interests, hopes and dreams of thousands of Korean-Americans. Mr. Speaker, the Korean-American community in New York epitomizes the American dream.Decades ago, thousands of immigrants, fleeing from war, poverty and desolation came to our nation's gateway of opportunity: New York City. Without knowing the language, without great wealth, but with strong family ties, robust community support and countless hours of hard work, Korean-Americans, like waves of immigrants before them have taken root and thrived in America.Critical to their success was their ability to organize themselves for mutual support and assistance. At the heart of the Korean-American community's efforts were organizations like the Korean-American Association of Greater New York. Beginning in 1960, the Korean-American Association of Greater New York has helped Korean immigrants in learning English, organizing themselves within the blue-collar industries where they were able to find work, registering to vote, and developing youth and government outreach programs.Now, as is obvious to anyone who travels in the New York metropolitan area, second generation Korean-Americans have moved into every branch and comer of American life and have succeeded beyond the wildest expectations of their ancestors, who came to this country with so little in tangible goods, but with a wealth of determination and perseverance.As we recalled so recently, on the anniversary of the Korean War, Korea and the United States are joined inseparably by a bond of allegiance formed in war and bound in the blood of the fallen soldiers of both nations. Similarly, Korean-Americans, whose presence here in the United States is tied with the great tragedy of that war, remember the great sorrow of the war for Korea together with an immeasurable appreciation for their adopted homeland. The courage and loyalty of the American soldier in answering the Republic of Korea in its hour of need is now matched by the devotion of Korean-Americans to this nation.Just as the Republic of Korea and its relations with the United States have flourished and grown stronger in the years since the war, so too the Korean-American community has prospered and given back to this nation double what they have received. Nowhere is this fact more obvious than in New York.I am honored, therefore, to pay tribute in this House to the Korean-American Association of Greater New York and its president, Sie Jong Lee, for their critical role in the success of the Korean-American community. I would also like to recognize all the current officers of the Association, Yong Sang Yoon, Jeong Ho Kim, Bok Ja Chang, Heon Gae Lee, Jay Joonseok Oh, Piljae Im, Hyun Woo Han, Myung Sook Chun, Daehong Kim, Mi Kyung Choi, Young-Joo Rhee, and Bo Young Jung, and to wish them all the best of success in the decades to come.",

This measure authorizes $1.6 billion over five years for various estuary conservation and restoration activities, including the Long Island Sound.Preservation of the Long Island Sound is not a parochial issue, but a national one. By its inclusion as a charter member in the National Estuaries Program, the Sound has been designated as one of only 28 estuaries of national significance. Congress recognized the national importance of the Sound by creating the Long Island Sound Study (LISS), which involved Federal, state, and local entities as well as private groups. The result of this study was the Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP). This report has detailed the many challenges which Long Island Sound faces including floating garbage, biological contamination, and industrial waste--in short, all the things which plague our modern society.The time to act is now. The $200 million over 5 years which is authorized under this agreement, will be used to provide grants to implement remedial efforts to clean up the Long Island Sound as part of the CCMP.I am proud to represent an area that borders the Long Island Sound. The Sound is one of our nation's natural treasures with important environmental, recreational, and commercial benefits.

I would like to thank Mr. Shuster and Mr. Oberstar for their leadership on this legislation and their commitment to preserving our national estuaries. I would also like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of my colleagues who represent areas along Long Island Sound.

I think some of us read it in a different way that choosing a level that reflects a requirement, and the key word is a ``requirement,'' on the Medicare+Choice organizations to offer plans that are no less than 3 years old. We think that that means that they can expend no funds other than to write a contract that would last 3 years. Anything else would be unacceptable under the language that we are offering.Our senior citizens are in trouble in this country. They are not doing as well as so many other segments of society. There is so much uncertainty and insecurity in their lives that the instability that the current system offers them is totally unacceptable.We approach things a little bit differently on Long Island, our congressional delegation that is, and we try to do things in more of a nonpartisan way when it affects our constituents. So we worked together, each and every one of us, Democrats and Republicans alike. And in the County of Suffolk, which is on the eastern end of Long Island, which I proudly share with our colleague, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lazio), we have a situation which is critical that is highlighted by this legislation.Every single Medicare+Choice plan, with the exception of one, has announced that they are leaving Suffolk County because they are not being reimbursed quickly enough or adequately enough; and our senior citizens, those of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lazio) and mine, are absolutely traumatized. They do not know what is going to happen.The one remaining plan has already announced they are going to have an additional $75 premium each month. Somebody has to come down here to the floor and stick up for those senior citizens who are living in abject fear, whether they be in the district of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lazio) or my district on Long Island.And those are not the only places. All of these, these are single-space lists of counties throughout the country where this problem is imminent right now. But in our county, that of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lazio) and mine, the announcement has already been made that they are packing up and leaving. They have given their 6-month notice.These people have nowhere to go. There is but one plan left. What happens to my colleague's seniors? What happens to my seniors with the remaining plan if they are only limited to one more year? Where will these people go? They will have no coverage. And if that is the case, shame on each and every one of us for not providing to our constituents the protection that they need.The constituents of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lazio) need it. My constituents need it. And the constituents of so many Members whose districts appear on these lists need it, as well.",

All of us who love liberty are justified in noting this important day. Greece is the birthplace of the democratic ideal, the principle upon which all our work here depends. The genius of the American republic and the concept of liberty, which sustained our fight for independence, cannot be separated from the great works of the philosophers of ancient Greece.Every ethnic group in the United States can claim a special bond to our nation's essence. But Greek-Americans can take special pride in knowing that our constitution's organizing principle, ``a government of the people, by the people and for the people'' came to our shores from the heart of the Aegean.Madam Speaker, Greece has been a friend and ally to the United States longer than many countries have been in existence. And, through immigration, our nation has been the great beneficiary of the strength, wisdom and creativity of Greece's sons and daughters. Millions of Americans who can trace their family roots back to Greece have contributed in countless ways, large and small, to the greatness, prosperity and harmony of the United States.I believe the influence of Greece on our nation is underappreciated because it is so ubiquitous. We see it in our nation's architecture, it surrounds us in our theater and humanities, it is instilled in our national intellect at all of our great universities. We need only look around this chamber to sense how critical Greece's legacy to our country has been.Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, Representative Michael Bilirakis and Representative Carolyn Maloney, for helping to organize this salute to Greek Independence Day.

In particular Bangladesh has made major strides to meet the needs of its growing population and is now largely self-sufficient in rice production. Bangladesh is also a leader in microenterprise lending. The world famous Grameen Bank has provided small business loans to more than 2.4 million customers in 39,000 villages. The bank has a 98 percent loan recovery rate from its customers, 94 percent of whom are women. In a recent and promising development, 40-50 trillion cubic feet of natural gas have been discovered giving Bangladesh a long term source of energy and enough to become a natural gas exporter.U.S.-Bangladesh relations have also grown in recent years. The United States is Bangladesh's number one trading partner. U.S. investment in Bangladesh has grown from $25 million to over $750 million in the last four years. But economic interests are not the only ties that bind the U.S. and Bangladesh.Bangladesh has played a significant role in international peacekeeping activities. Several thousand Bangladeshi military personnel are deployed overseas on peacekeeping operations. Under U.N. auspices, Bangladeshi troops have served or are serving in Somalia, Rwanda, Mozambique, Kuwait, Bosnia, Haiti, and East Timor. Regionally, Bangladesh is a nation at peace with its neighbors and focused on regional integration through the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.In addition, Bangladesh has demonstrated its commitment to environmental preservation by becoming the first country to participate in a debt for nature swap under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998. This program allowed Bangladesh to exchange a portion of its concessional debt to the United States in return for the preservation of more than 3 million acres of tropical forest home to the world's last genetically viable population of Bengal tigers.Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in commending the nation of Bangladesh for 30 years of independence.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer my amendment to prevent the marketing of downed animals.As I stand here before you, the most horrific problem of animal abuse in the meat industry continues unchecked. A sick cow, unable to stand, is pulled off a truck by a tractor with a chain, then falls 4 feet to the ground at a stockyard. A frail day-old calf is dragged through an auction ring by a rope tied to its back leg while another calf, nearly comatose, is left in a corner dying. These are downed animals. The transport and marketing of these incapacitated animals creates tremendous human health concerns as well as humane concerns.These animals, known as downers, suffer beyond belief as they are kicked, dragged, and prodded with electric shocks in an effort to move them at auctions and intermediate markets en route to slaughter. They make up nearly one-tenth of 1 percent of the market. And not to euthanize them just because they are of no value when they are dead at marketplace is indeed a sin.It is practically impossible to move these animals humanely, so they are commonly dragged with chains and pushed around with tractors and fork lifts. In addition to brutal handling, downed animals routinely suffer for days without food, water, or veterinary attention. Livestock markets are not equipped nor can they be expected to provide these incapacitated animals with the intensive care they require, nor do we wish to saddle them with these costs. The only humane option for nonambulatory livestock at intermediate markets is euthanasia.My amendment to protect both the public health and the downed animals prohibits marketing of all nonambulatory livestock at intermediate markets, and it requires that incapacitated animals be humanely euthanized at these facilities. This amendment does not apply to activities on farms, and it does not preclude veterinary care. It provides an appropriate remedy to an unnecessary and inexcusable practice.The problem of downed animals has been addressed by many conscientious livestock organizations who have voluntarily adopted a no-downer policy in an effort to end this inhumane and cruel practice which can also pose a serious threat to our public health. Meat from downed animals has an increased risk for bacterial contamination and other diseases, including neurological afflictions such as mad cow disease. The veterinary services department at the USDA itself, Mr. Chairman, has said that downed animals are the number two risk for mad cow disease. This is not a fringe idea.Last year, the USDA itself instituted a policy precluding the purchase of beef from downed animals for the national school lunch program because of these safety concerns.How on God's Earth can they justify marketing this to the rest of the country, when they say it is unsafe to put in our school lunch program?In addition to this, the fast food chains are doing the appropriate thing. Chains such as McDonald's and Burger King and Wendy's have all banned the use of meat from downed animals in their products. And who else? California, the largest cattle producer in the country, Colorado and Illinois, have already prohibited the entry of downed animals into the food supply. Why just them? All Americans must be protected from this risk.And who else is in support? This measure is endorsed by the Central Livestock Association, which is composed of 25,000 producers in five Midwestern States alone. It is endorsed by Empire Livestock Marketing, the Georgia Cattlemen's Association, and the National Pork Producers Council; and the National Cattlemen's Beef Producer Association have put in their code of ethics that they will not use downers.And yet, and yet, there are some who kowtow to the few irresponsible folks within the industry in order to protect only one-tenth of 1 percent of the market.Earlier this year a Zogby America Poll of 1,000 people in our country found that four out of every five opposed the use of downed animals for human food. Yet despite a strong consensus within the livestock industry, the animal welfare movement and 80 percent of consumers that downed animals should not be sent to the stockyards, this practice continues, causing unnecessary animal suffering and an erosion of the public confidence in their food. We need to remedy this atrocity.I urge all who are concerned about public health, all who are concerned about the humane treatment of animals to support the amendment.The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Hastings of Washington). The time of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Ackerman) has expired.(By unanimous consent, Mr. Ackerman was allowed to proceed for 30 additional seconds.)",

The FHA multifamily loan programs support the new construction and substantial rehabilitation of much needed affordable rental housing.Our Nation faces a growing affordable housing crisis for low- and moderate-income families. Yet the FHA multifamily loan limits have not been raised in 9 years. How can we expect the private sector to produce affordable rental housing, when they cannot receive affordable financing?Construction costs have risen more than 25 percent since the last increase. One simple way to stimulate the development of affordable housing in our communities is to increase the multifamily loan limits. In my home State of New York, the current limit is $87,226 per two-bedroom unit. In the last 4 years not one unit has been produced under the FHA multifamily loan program, due to that low number. The 25-percent increase established in this conference agreement would raise the limit in New York to $106,952.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this necessary and important increase that will benefit so many working families throughout our Nation.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, one of the newest members Raja Sabha, the Upper House of India's national parliament is Murli Deora, who has been one of the United States' strongest advocates and closest friends for many years. Murli's election to the Raja Sabha is a well deserved honor which some might say is long overdue.Murli has enjoyed a distinguished career as a public servant in India and throughout the world. A former mayor of Mumbai, India's largest city, Murli served for many years in India's Lower House, the Lok Sabha, where he rose to prominence in a number of areas, including India-U.S. relations. Murli worked tirelessly to bring the world's oldest democracy closer to the world's largest democracy. Murli carried on this effort even when relations between our two countries grew distant during the Cold War. Because of Murli's foresight, countless politicians and business leaders in the United States have long sought his counsel and advice on matters in India.Mr. Speaker, as a former Chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, as well as a former Co-Chairman of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian-Americans, I can attest to the generous time and energy Murli has given to fostering ties between our two countries. I have also had the privilege of working with Murli when he served as International President of Parliamentarians for Global Action, a worldwide inter-parliamentary organization focusing on many critical issues facing the world today. I also have watched with great interest and much pride as Murli built a series of computer training centers in many Indian cities to provide underprivileged children with free computer education.Mr. Speaker, for the last several years Murli has immersed himself in the activities of the Red Cross in India, where he has served as Vice-Chairman. A legendary fund raiser, Murli secured critical funds to bring much needed relief for the victims of the devastating earthquake which rocked Gujurat last year. His important work in India earned Murli the second highest position at the Red Cross's international headquarters in Geneva.Mr. Speaker, Murli Deora's uncontested election to the Raja Sabha is a crowning achievement for a long and distinguished career in Indian politics. I am certain that all of our colleagues who are active in promoting stronger ties between the United States and India join me in extending congratulations and best wishes to Murli and his family. I am confident that, as Murli ascends to this important legislative body, that the citizens of India will once again benefit from his longstanding advocacy for democracy, economic development, social welfare and secularism.",

    "text": "Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3994, the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act.At the outset, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman Hyde) and the ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), for their tremendous efforts to craft a bipartisan bill supporting rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance in Afghanistan.It is important for the Congress to speak loudly and clearly regarding a long-term commitment to Afghanistan, and I think the bill before us today does just that. In addition, the bill answers the President's call last October for the Congress to support reconstruction assistance for Afghanistan.As has been noted, the bill provides over $1 billion for humanitarian relief, refugee assistance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction in Afghanistan. This assistance is linked to adherence to the Bonn process and to progress on eradicating poverty, but in neither case is the aid so closely linked that it deprives the President of the flexibility necessary to pursue U.S. objectives in that country.Throughout the bill, the importance of the role of women is emphasized, from the structure of the future government to health care and education programs specifically for women and girls. In addition, the assistance has a particular focus on the agricultural economy in Afghanistan. I think this is especially important given that the vast majority of Afghans live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for their livelihood.The emphasis also dovetails nicely with our efforts to eradicate poppy by giving farmers a viable alternative to the narcotics trade.Madam Chairman, the bill also authorizes military assistance to support the formation of an Afghan police force and a national army. In addition, this assistance is available to foreign countries or international organizations who are directly supporting our military activities in Afghanistan, or are participating in peacekeeping or policing operations there. I believe that the military assistance provisions are appropriate and are focused on the needs of U.S. policy.Madam Chairman, this bill is an excellent example of what can be accomplished through bipartisan efforts. I commend the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) for their leadership on this issue, and I urge all of our colleagues to support the bill.",

    "text": "Madam Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words, and I rise in support of the Lantos amendment.Madam Chairman, I congratulate the gentleman from California for offering his amendment, because it highlights a particularly important aspect of our current efforts in Afghanistan. Everything we have achieved to the present time is dependent on the security situation in Afghanistan. No level of assistance will be effective if aid workers cannot reach those in need.Indeed, the Committee on International Relations received testimony from AID administrator Andrew Natsios that the current security situation on the ground is unsuitable for rapid or sustainable change. The Secretary of Defense has also said that before anything else can happen in Afghanistan, there must be security.Yet, humanitarian aid organizations have reported threats to their workers and attempts at extortion by local commanders. These conditions will not only threaten the delivery of humanitarian assistance, but they will make it impossible to establish an effective program of reconstruction.Recent events such as the assassination attempt on Defense Minister Fahim, the foiled plot to kill Afghanistan's King Zahir Shah, which delayed his return to his country, and the tragic killing of a United Nations aid worker are all part of a disturbing pattern of rising violence, a pattern that threatens to undermine the Loya Jirga process. In fact, Human Rights Watch reports that insecurity in certain provinces has caused the cancellation of Loya Jirga elections in portions of those provinces.Madam Chairman, there are immediate security needs that as of now are going unmet. If we do not address the situation now, U.S. troops who are on the ground will have to stay in Afghanistan even longer. Such insecurity aspects put our troops at greater risk and threaten our ability to meet our military objectives in Afghanistan.I know that the administration is opposed to expanding the International Security Force beyond the boundaries of Kabul, and I know the President supports the training of an Afghan police force and a national army. I support the President in the rebuilding of these institutions. Afghanistan should ultimately be responsible for their own security. But these are long-term solutions. Even the Department of Defense acknowledges that it will be at least 18 months before a national army is ready. What are the citizens of Afghanistan to do in the meantime?We need a strategy to bridge the gap between now and the time when the Afghans can truly provide their own security across the country and that, Madam Chairman, that is what the amendment asks for.Since the President has already foreclosed the option of expanding the International Security Assistance Force, I believe that it is incumbent upon him and the administration to provide an alternative solution. Without U.S. leadership on this question, nothing will be done to address it. The President has said, and I agree, that Afghanistan's persistent poverty, war, and chaos laid the groundwork for the Taliban to seize power. If nothing is done now to address the security situation in Afghanistan, we risk plunging that nation back into the conflict from which it has so recently emerged.Madam Chairman, the Lantos amendment can help us to avoid that fate, and I urge all of our colleagues to support it.",

On June 15th, 2002, at the 53rd National Civic League Convention in Kansas City, Missouri. Huntington was selected out of 30 finalists to be proclaimed an All-American City, and thus became the first Long Island community to receive this impressive designation.The All-American City Award is one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious distinctions, given to those communities, which demonstrate outstanding leadership and collaboration in addressing community-wide challenges and achieving exceptional results.This spring, the Town of Huntington's Chamber of Commerce, a business partnership that represents more than 1,300 members, was officially notified by the National Civic League that Huntington had been selected as a finalist for the 2002 All-American City Award. For the next month and a half, the Chamber of Commerce prepared extensively for a final 10-minute formal presentation to be given before the All-American City Jury Panel. It was the success of this final presentation, which highlighted three community-based projects, that clinched the award for Huntington.Mr. Speaker, this distinction is a glowing reflection on all members of the Huntington community. Specifically, I would like to call attention to the tireless work of Dennis Sneden, the CEO of the Huntington Township Chamber of Commerce; Frank Petrone, the Town Supervisor; Board members Marlene Budd, Mark Cuthbertson, Susan Berland, and Mark Capadonno and all the individuals and businesses, citizens and entrepreneurs, of the Huntington community.Commenting on Huntington's success, Town Supervisor Petrone summed up the reason for Huntington's smashing success. ``This designation speaks to the commitment of a community which works together for the betterment of all its residents,'' he said. ``The partnership between Huntington Township Chamber of Commerce and the Town of Huntington's government sets an example for the region.''I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me now in honoring this historic achievement, and in congratulating all the members of the Huntington community for the inspirational example they have provided for cities, towns and villages throughout New York State and our entire nation.",

Bom in a rural village in Gujurat, he rose from a small trader of textiles and spices to head the largest and most profitable industrial concern in India, the Reliance Group. Through a series of shrewd. business moves and decades of hard work, Dhirubhai Ambani transformed Reliance from a minor retail concern into an entity which included the largest and most modem refinery in Asia, a petrochemical business of unparalleled quality, a five billion dollar satellite and broadband subsidiary, and petroleum and refining businesses which set the standard throughout South Asia. At the time of his death, Dhirubhai Ambani oversaw an economic juggernauht which accounted in almost 3 percent of India's GDP and 16 percent of the value of the Bombay Stock Exchange. He was one of the wealthiest men in the world, a recognized billionaire by Forbes Magazine, and in 2000 he was rightly acknowledged by Business India magazine as India's Businessman of the Century.Mr. Speaker, although Dhirubhai Ambani became very rich, his wealth was never closely held. Unlike many old line Indian companies, Dhirubhai Ambani shunned debt financing from banks and instead offered shares in Reliance to India's growing middle class. Shares in Reliance were eagerly purchased whenever offered. Today there are more than three million shareholders, almost all of whom are financially far better off as a result of their investment.For anyone who may wonder about the ability of capitalism to flourish in the Indian economy, despite that country's long dance with government intervention and control, one need look no further than the story of The Reliance Group and its departed Chairman, Dhirubhai Ambani.Mr. Speaker, as the Former Chairman of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans and a frequent visitor to India, I had the distinct privilege of spending time with Dhirubhai Ambani both at his office in South Bombay and his lovely residence. He was a gentleman of immediate warmth. A modest man who did not discuss his achievements or his generosity towards his employees, his community and his country, Dhirubhai Ambani immediately made me feel as through we had been friends for a long time.Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues join me in expressing condolences to Dhirubhai Ambani's two sons, Mukesh and Anil, who have taken over the management of Reliance, as well as his widow, Kokilaben, and his two daughters. Although they have suffered a great loss, their loss is shared, not only by India's citizens, but by many friends of India in the Congress and throughout the United States.",

Unfortunately, many of us are painfully aware. Many, if not all of us have known someone who has fought against this devastating disease. I would like to express my deep appreciation to the many soldiers in the battle against breast cancer. There are too many to name right now, but their dedication and tireless efforts are critical and so deeply appreciated by us all.A recent study found that the presence of mutated BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 genes made cancer risk soar. This information proves that passage of legislation such as the Genetic Non-Discrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act is imperative. Mr. Speaker, I am a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation, which has 230 cosponsors. By not acting on this legislation, we are placing women's health in jeopardy on a daily basis. Women are not being tested because they fear they will be discriminated against by their insurer should they test positive. This is unconscionable.This body has begun the job of funding the National Institutes of Health and cancer research over the past five years. However, our work is not done. It is imperative that we are able to fund new research and continue existing research. In order to ensure that progress is not lost and valuable information left uncovered, we must continue to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health. One of the things I am most proud to have motivated and enacted was the establishment of the Long Island Breast Cancer Study, a comprehensive effort to investigate whether environmental factors are responsible for breast cancer. The historic investigation began in 1993, and was coordinated by the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. When the study was released late last year, I was disappointed to find the study could not identify specific environmental factors from among the three compounds studied as a cause for breast cancer. Many of the other compounds remain to be ruled out; more funding and research are necessary. However, the lessons learned proved very important. Many of the results provided clues for future research. We must build on this information, we must try until we succeed because the alternative is much more costly.We need to work together to turn ``A-wareness'' into ``A-cure.''",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution and I thank the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on the Middle East and Central Asia for her leadership in bringing H. Res. 615 to the floor. As an original cosponsor of this resolution I am very pleased that the House will, I hope, pass the resolution by an overwhelming, if not unanimous vote.Israel's isolation at the United Nations puts the lie to claims that Israel is not held to a double standard and demonstrates clearly that many of those urbane diplomats who like to talk about peace and reconciliation cannot even stomach the thought of Israel taking its rightful place at the U.N. While space is reserved and rights are held for such pariah states as junta-led Myanmar, dictator-ruled North Korea, the tyranny of the mullahs in Iran and the Palestinians' own thugocracy, democratic Israel is uniquely isolated at what is supposed to be the forum for all nations to deal with each other on equal terms.Ironically, every day, because of the hostility and prejudice that precludes Iraeli participation in the Asia regional group, the credibility and mission of the United Nations is undermined by exactly those states that call most vigorously for the Arab-Israeli conflict to be resolved in accordance with the will of the United Nations. The stench of this hypocrisy easily reaches Washington all the way from U.N. headquarters in New York City.The resolution before the House calls for renewed efforts by this Nation to secure for Israel full membership in the Western Europe and Others Group at the U.N. the membership bloc our own country belongs to. Such a step is entirely appropriate given the close ties between Israel and the other nations in the bloc, as well as shared values and belief in democracy that characterizes this group's membership at the Thanks in large measure to the United States, Israel has, for a short time, been able to enjoy at least partial membership in the WEOG regional group. It is time for this half-measure to be replaced with a lasting and definite full membership. Israel is a country of far greater economic, political and scientific achievement than many of those nations that have obstructed full Israeli participation in the UN. It is more than past time that this grotesque form of discrimination be ended.I urge Members to show their strong support for Israel and the true ideals of the UN by voting in favor of the resolution.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Rotary International, the world's first service club, and to mark the 52nd year of the Rotary Club of Great Neck.Since their establishment on February 23, 1905, by Paul P. Harris, the members of Rotary International have been completely dedicated to fulfilling the goal of their motto: service above self. Over the past 100 years, Rotarians have been providing humanitarian services in communities, workplaces, and throughout the world. In doing so, Rotarians have developed numerous community service projects that assist communities in responding to the critical issues they face, including hunger, poverty, illiteracy, vocational and career development, the environment, and protecting at risk children.The popularity of Rotary International has quickly spread throughout the world, with clubs forming across the United States and on six continents. Currently, there are approximately 1.2 million Rotarians who belong to more than 31,000 Rotary clubs in 166 different countries.The Rotary Club of Great Neck was chartered in 1953, and since then their members have been very active in local and international humanitarian projects. Each November, the Rotary Club of Great Neck holds a Thanksgiving Turkey Drive, where volunteers pack more than 26 tons of food into complete Thanksgiving dinners and distribute them to needy families in the New York metropolitan area. The Great Neck club is also very active in the Gift of Life Program, which provides life saving open-heart surgery to needy children across the world, at no cost to them or their families. Great Neck Rotarians also work with and mentor local students on a weekly basis, teaching them about the joys of giving back to the community and assisting the students with their own service projects.Mr. Speaker, I commend Rotary International, the Rotary Club of Great Neck, and Rotarians across the world for their continued and dedicated service. These fine men and women selflessly volunteer their time to help make our world a better place, and their contributions are immeasurable. I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to please join me in honoring Rotary International as they celebrate their 100th anniversary.",

Andre, the Psychiatric Services Coordinator at the Margaret Tietz Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Jamaica, New York, was inspired by his experiences working with aging individuals suffering from serious health problems.On his way from San Francisco to Jamaica, Andre, who himself is nearing retirement age, stopped at various American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging facilities to meet with and inspire staff members and patients alike. Accompanied by family members along the way, Andre has dedicated the ``Ride for the Ages'' to his daughter, Michele, who survived leukemia as a result of a bone marrow transplant from her brother Jean-Daniel.Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I commend Andre Louis for his altruism and dedication to the health of our seniors. He is truly a determined individual and an inspiration to us all.

She joins over 200 Museum Teacher Fellows in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's program, all of whom continue to serve as community leaders in Holocaust education.As a Museum Teacher Fellow, Meryl will create an outreach project to bring Holocaust education to groups outside the walls of the traditional school environment. This may include distance learning, working with adult groups, or conducting programs in schools, the community, or other professional organizations. Mr. Speaker, I cannot stress enough the importance of Holocaust education. We must never forget. We must teach and remember the Holocaust because genocide is real. It is not history, it is reality.Meryl will be returning to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum throughout the year for further training and to report on her outreach project. Once the 2005-06 academic year is over, she will continue to advance American Holocaust education by supporting future fellows, and, of course, continuing to lead the effort in our community.Mr. Speaker, it is with a great pride that I rise to commend Meryl Menashe. Her dedication to Holocaust education, a sad but necessary task, is extraordinary and she is well deserving of her appointment as a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Teacher Fellow.

Madam Speaker, this resolution purports to protect the symbols of Christmas, but what really needs to be protected are not the symbols of Christmas, but rather the spirit of Christmas. The spirit of Christmas demands generosity and goodwill towards others.Instead of legislation that respects the spirit of Christmas, Congress in just these past few weeks has passed a budget that includes mean-spirited attacks on the least of us. For those who are hungry, we are cutting food stamps. For those who are sick, we are cutting Medicaid. For those who are in prison, we are imposing senseless mandatory minimums. For others we are ignoring increases in heating costs and cutting student loans. At the same time we are cutting those programs to help the least of us, we are cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.Madam Speaker, we ought to express our passion for Christmas through deeds, not words; and we should not be distracted from our responsibility to uphold the spirit of Christmas as we consider the effects our actions on the Federal budget will have on the least of us during this holiday season.For these reasons I oppose this resolution.",

Less than a week later, realizing what a great asset Barbara was, the Board of Elections offered her a permanent position. Seven years later, in 1988, the Board once again recognized her outstanding work and promoted Barbara to Administrative Assistant, where she performed masterfully. In June of 1991, she was appointed as Chief Clerk of the Queens Board of Elections. Over the past fourteen years, Barbara has held this post with remarkable poise, leadership and distinction.Despite her hectic career, Barbara has voluntarily served our community through a number of organizations. She is a Past-President of the Knights of Columbus--General Father Sherman Shine Columbiettes, a member of the Queens Historical Society, and Secretary of the Board of Directors of the Mitchell Gardens Co-op.While Barbara has had a distinguished and praiseworthy career at the Board of Elections, and is celebrated as a community leader, her family--her husband of 30 years, Ronald, along with her two daughters, Amanda and Lisa, and two granddaughters, Brianna and Tiffani--remains the source of her greatest pride and inspiration.Mr. Speaker, it is with great satisfaction that I rise to commend Barbara Conacchio.

    "title": "CONGRATULATING ISRAEL'S MAGEN DAVID ADOM SOCIETY",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their assistance in getting this resolution through the committee, and especially note the hard work and determination of my colleague, the chairperson of the subcommittee, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen of Florida. Their support is deeply appreciated.Mr. Speaker, there are very, very few issues that are really just black and white, where there are good guys and there are bad guys. This struggle, the 60-year effort to win membership for Israel's humanitarian society, the Magen David Adom, Israel's Blue Shield of David, into the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, has been such an enterprise.Like all of my colleagues speaking in support of this resolution, I am honored to have been part of that struggle, and am deeply gratified by the clear, indeed overwhelming victory MDA won last month in Geneva. It is a triumph where humanitarian principles overranked politics and bigotry. It is a triumph for the State of Israel and the Jewish people. It is a triumph for patient, cooperative, multilateral diplomacy and especially American leadership. The victory of MDA really illustrates how important American leadership is, and what this Nation can accomplish with determination, tenacity, and a commitment to holding and protecting the moral high ground in international debate.There never was a good argument against MDA. And with that fact came the moral strength and clarity. And with that strength and clarity came this hard-won victory.As Dr. Martin Luther King liked to say, the arc of the universe is long, but it bends towards justice. A lot of people earned a share of the success that occurred in Geneva. Many of us in the House wrote letters, spoke directly with the Red Cross officials in Europe and with officials within the administration to let them know that Congress backed them 100 percent.All we asked in return was, What more we could do to help? Credit is also due to America's diplomats and to America's humanitarians. Secretary Rice's State Department showed again what a force American diplomacy can be in a righteous cause.And the American Red Cross, the American Red Cross alone in the entire world drew a line in the sand, withholding $45 million in dues to the Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies until the MDA won equal treatment. Only the American Red Cross was willing to put its money where its mouth was and to insist that international humanitarian law should not, could not, and now thankfully cannot be used as a tool of discrimination against Israel.This resolution congratulates Israel on the Magen David Adom Society, which is facing a terrible trial right now, with terrorist rockets falling both in northern and southern Israel. Our thoughts and prayers are with them both. The Magen David Adom stands for everything Hezbollah and Hamas reject, the independence of Israel as a sovereign Jewish state, equal treatment and protection for all people, regardless of their faith, and the belief that there are standards of behavior beyond the realm of political convenience, and above all, the value of life over death.Mr. Speaker, in the business of international politics and diplomacy, clear-cut triumphs are few and far between. I am thrilled to be able to celebrate with you today what a bipartisan, bicameral, cross-branch, multinational, public-private effort can do.But what we are here to celebrate principally is a high moral triumph. I want to thank all of those who helped bring us to this great day and to the Magen David Adom, I say yasher koach, and congratulations on this well-deserved and long-overdue victory.I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution.Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/4\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Berkley) and thank her for her leadership in this effort as well.",

    "title": "HONORING FORMER MEMBER OF CONGRESS THOMAS J. MANTON",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the legacy and the record of our distinguished former colleague, Thomas J. Manton, a superb public servant who passed away on July 22nd.Tom Manton was born on November 3, 1932. In many ways, his birth date was symbolic of the man Tom would become. Just as Franklin Delano Roosevelt, elected President a few days later, would usher in a new era of optimism and faith in the American system, Tom Manton lived a life that served as an inspiration to all who believed, and continue to believe, in the American Dream.A young child during the Depression, Tom Manton was a typical son of Irish immigrants, people who came to this country in search of work and a better life for their children. In fact, Tom's father, Tom, Sr., was a laborer here at the United States Capitol. Surely, as he worked to help build the Cannon House Office Building, he must have looked around now and then, seen the grandeur of the place, and dreamed that one day, his son would work there, not as a laborer, but as an elected representative with an office suite in the building. This most American of dreams, in fact, came true.Tom attended St. Joseph's School in Astoria, Queens, and St. John's Prep in Brooklyn; he earned an undergraduate degree and, by going to school at night, a law degree from St. John's University. When his country needed him, Tom Manton served as a Flight Navigator in the U.S. Marine Corps. He then continued to serve his Nation and community by becoming a New York City Police Officer.In 1970, Tom was elected to the New York City Council, where he continued his work to safeguard the welfare of his fellow citizens. He would continue in this position for fourteen years. In 1984, Tom seized the opportunity to represent his community in the U.S. House of Representatives when he won the election to succeed Democratic vice-presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro.Two years later, Tom became the Chairman of the Queens County Democratic organization and immediately began the revitalization of the local party. Tom took the reins at a time when the party was racked with front-page problems and a loss of public trust. Not only did he turn the party organization around and bring it back to full health, but in doing so, he insisted on making its membership more diverse and more reflective of the diversity of our beloved borough of Queens.Tom's passion for equality took form in his commitment to helping new political leaders of varying ethnic backgrounds achieve impressive firsts. He helped elect the first Latino from Queens to the New York State Assembly; the first Chinese-American to the City Council; the first woman to serve as Borough President; and then the first African-American woman to Borough Presidency; he supported the first Indian-American and Korean-American District Leaders. These are just a few of these achievements.As a direct result of the discipline and commitment he brought to every task, and the tireless work he put into the party, the Queens Democratic Committee is now one of the strongest party organizations in the country. Every Democratic candidate for President, going back to Michael Dukakis, sought Tom out, knowing that without his support, the votes of Queens Democrats would be few and far between.As a congressman, Tom was a bull-dog-like advocate for New York's interests. He won a seat on the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and used his influence to bring jobs and opportunity to his constituents. He fought for critical improvements in the Superfund program to accelerate the cleanup of toxic waste sites. He also took the lead in improving the conservation of our Nation's fisheries and ocean resources as chairman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries Management. He used his experience as a former member of the NYPD to ensure that police officers across the Nation--and their families--would receive fitting lifetime compensation in the event of permanent job-related injuries. He was a Member's Member, constantly working behind the scenes to assist his colleagues, helping to rescue stuck legislation, or cutting deals that made everyone feel like a winner.Having lived the American Dream himself, Tom worked ceaselessly to safeguard the opportunity for everyone, native born and immigrant alike, to live the American Dream as well. Tom was tough, but Tom was fair. And respect for Tom was universal, and went beyond ideology or partisan boundaries.Tom never forgot his roots. He played a tireless and crucial role in helping to bring peace to Northern Ireland. He served as co-chair of the bipartisan Irish Caucus. He was selected to be the Grand Marshal of the New York City Saint Patrick's Day Parade, something of which I know he was proud.With Tom Manton's passing, we have lost one of the classic old school Irish politicians that New York has sent to Washington to look after the interests of ordinary Americans. Tom was a guy who was decent and honest. His word and handshake were his bond. Tom worked quietly behind the curtain, rather than grandstanding in front of the cameras. Tom was a stand-up guy, the real deal.When Tom Manton entered Congress in 1985, I had been serving in Congress for little more than a year. All of us in the New York delegation turned to Tom for advice and guidance. Tom made a difference in the lives of everyone who knew him, and his efforts improved this country for every one of its citizens.My heartfelt condolences go out to Tom's widow, Diane, his children, and grandchildren. He loved them dearly and they love him still. Like many of my colleagues, I will miss Tom. I will miss his wise counsel and his unquenchable passion for our community and its people. America and New York have lost a truly good man and a great public servant.",

In 1997, Mayor Giuliani appointed him to a six-year term as a member of The Trust for Cultural Resources of the City of New York. He was also a member of the Mayor's Advisory Council for Theatre.Mr. Richards served on the President's Council for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, and is on the Board of Directors of Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. In 1994, in memory of his wife, he established the Mary Lea Johnson Richards Institute at New York University Medical Center for organ transplantation and research, and in 1995, also in memory of his wife, he co-founded the Children's Advocacy Center of Manhattan, New York City's only non-profit center for abused children. For the past eight years he has produced the annual Red Ball, one of New York's premiere charitable events, which benefits both the Institute and the Advocacy Center.Martin Richards' life is a living example of the expression that one man can truly make a difference.

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, and yield myself such time as I may consume.Let me first thank the distinguished ranking member of the Africa and Global Health Subcommittee, my very good friend, Chris Smith, for his long-standing leadership in the fight against torture. I am very proud to be a cosponsor of this very important piece of legislation before us today.The Torture Victims Relief Act of 1998 is a landmark piece of legislation that enshrines the fundamental commitment of this Nation to assist all survivors of torture, wherever and whoever they might be.The programs supported by the TVRA combat the effects of the most despicable of all human rights violations: The increasing use of torture around the world.Although exact figures are difficult to ascertain, according to Amnesty International, a well-respected defender of human rights, more than 150 countries worldwide still engage in torture.An estimated 400,000 to 500,000 foreign torture victims reside in the United States, and over 100 million may exist worldwide. More than 250 treatment centers operate internationally with the sole purpose of providing medical, psychological and social services to torture survivors. These crucial facilities provide a distinctive type of treatment to those victims.In the U.S., the Center for Victims of Torture, located in Minnesota, was the first of its kind in the United States and the third torture victims treatment center in the world.The personal ramifications of torture are beyond the comprehension of those who have not gone through it. Torture leaves no victim unscarred. It shapes the remainder of their lives. While physical wounds may ultimately heal, torture survivors need ongoing psychological services and therapy to cope with post-traumatic stress that afflicts them daily. Recovering from torture is a long-term process. It can take years before torture survivors can once again feel emotionally stable and comfortable in society.The bill before the House today funds our very important fight against torture, both nationally and internationally. For international programs, this legislation authorizes $12 million per year for centers and programs administered through USAID's Victims of Torture Fund. It also authorizes an additional $12 million a year for centers and programs administered through the U.N. Voluntary Fund for the Victims of Torture.Domestically, our legislation authorizes $25 million annually for the Department of Health and Human Services so that HHS can assist domestic treatment centers fully and sufficiently.The sad truth is that torture is not waning; if anything, it is on the rise. As a moral force and a Nation that exhibits empathy to those in most need, it is our firm responsibility to help the victims of torture with these comprehensive programs. The funds authorized are urgently needed to achieve this goal. I strongly support this legislation, and encourage every Member of the House to do so as well.Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

The Rabbi and Elaine will be the Guests of Honor at the Seudas Shabbos of Congregation Ohr Moshe in Hillcrest, New York, on May 12, 2007, where they will be honored for their lifelong community service. They will celebrate this joyous occasion surrounded by family and friends.The Strasbergs have been leaders in their community for more than three decades. Rabbi Michael led the Israel Center of Hillcrest Manor for 30 memorable years, during which he performed the B'nai Mitzvah services for my own children. More recently, he joined Congregation Ohr Moshe, which will be honoring the couple at a gala dinner on May 12.The Rabbi Strasberg now works at Sinai Chapels as Director of Pastoral Counseling. In this setting, he provides comfort and strength to families who are going through the trying and painful time of the loss of a loved one. The Rabbi also educates the community with his moving shiurim or lectures on the substance and meaning of the Torah. Michael and Elaine actively participate in community events and organizations on behalf of Sinai Chapels, and work to preserve halacha (Jewish law) and Jewish tradition.Elaine Strasberg is well-known for her superb cooking and enthusiastic leadership of Israeli dance classes for the women in the community. Elaine is also frequently at the top of my mind, as the creator of crocheted yarmulke, which I wear most often. The Strasbergs have always been great supporters of Israel and active in many causes to this end. The Strasbergs take great pride and joy in their family, especially their children and grandchildren. They have five children; daughters Chaya, who is married to Dani; Zahavi, Malka, Rehana, and son Amichai, who is married to Adina. They have four grandchildren and are eagerly anticipating the arrival of the fifth.Madam Speaker, I want to commend Rabbi Michael and Elaine Strasberg for their years of dedicated commitment to the Flushing and Jamaica communities and their residents.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, from time to time, I've heard some of our colleagues wondering why there are so many resolutions about Israel, and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Why, they may wonder, do we have to take up these issues? Doesn't everyone already know that the Congress supports Israel? And it's true, American support for Israel is overwhelming, it is bi-partisan, and it is nearly universal in Congress. But sadly, we are the exception in the world.Around the globe, there have been protests going on about the situation in Gaza. What may not be known is that these demonstrations are not about the rockets that have been falling on Israeli civilians. These protests are not against Hamas. These protests are not about the absurdity of expecting Israel to provide electricity and fuel to the people attacking them.These protests are against Israel and its right of self-defense. They are against demanding that Hamas stop the terror. They are against putting responsibility on the shoulders of Hamas for the welfare of the people in Gaza.To us, in the United States, such protests seem perverse. People who intentionally fire artillery rockets at civilians are properly called ``war criminals.'' People who deliberately seek the death of the innocent are not called ``militants,'' or ``activists,'' or ``guerillas.'' They are properly called ``terrorists,'' and it is hard for us to imagine that these are not universal beliefs.But they're not. What we have seen in the past, and are seeing again is an offensive and deplorable double standard: Every nation is obliged to protect its citizens--except the Israelis; they should be patient and exercise restraint. Every nation is entitled to fight terrorism--except the Israelis; they should have a dialogue with the people who call for their extermination. Every nation is entitled to use force defend itself--except the Israelis; they should only use force if there won't be civilian casualties.Mr. Speaker, we all mourn the loss of innocent life, and the sympathy of decent people is not limited by nationality. The American people are concerned about both Israeli and Palestinian lives. But that concern is not a excuse to dispense with judgement. There is guilt and there is innocence; and there is aggression and there is self-defense. Refusal to acknowledge, or to insist on these distinctions is not only immoral, but dangerous.And that is why the business in Gaza is the business of this House. America, as a leader among the community of nations, has an obligation to stand up in defense of certain values. And it is never so essential to do so than when those values are under attack, and that is what is happening right now.That is why we have to condemn Hamas. That is why we have to condemn the rockets that are still falling on Israeli towns and cities. That is why we have to stand with a democratic ally. That is why we have to declare again and again from this house that the people of Israel--no less than any other people--are entitled to live in peace and security. Certainly we Americans would accept nothing less for ourselves.",

Brumidi's awesome, inspiring murals and frescos are remarkable as they are ubiquitous. Constantino Brumidi's works can be found in three Senate Appropriations Committee rooms, the House Appropriations Committee room, the Senate Democratic Policy Committee room, the Brumidi corridors, the Senate reception area, the Office of the Vice President and, of course, the Rotunda. Like his masterful works throughout the Capitol, Constantino Brumidi's story is uniquely American.Brumidi was born in Rome in 1805 to an Italian mother and a Greek father. His artistic ability was cultivated at an early age. In his early years, he was commissioned to paint frescos and murals in various Roman palaces. And then in 1849, as did so many of our ancestors, Brumidi, who was already an established artist in Italy and who spent 3 years working for Pope Gregory XVI in the Vatican, migrated to the United States and began a new life in New York City. There he proudly became a naturalized American citizen in 1852.It was on a return trip from Mexico that Constantino Brumidi first saw the U.S. Capitol. It was a fortuitous twist of fate: at a time when Congress and President Franklin Pierce were preparing to expand the Capitol, a word-class Italian American artist, who just happened to be passing through Washington, inspired by both the freedoms and liberties represented by the seat of Congress and the vast open spaces in the Capitol that seemed to invite frescos and murals, offered his services to Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs. Wisely, Meigs commissioned Brumidi to become the artist of the Capitol.Brumidi's first work was in the Agricultural Committee room. This masterpiece received such favorable attention that he was given a raise and tasked with painting other larger works culminating with the works in the Capitol Rotunda.There is no work in the Capitol more impressive or more renowned than ``The Apotheosis of Washington.'' Brumidi completed the fresco in 11 months at the end of the Civil War, soon after the new dome was completed. This absolutely stunning work soars 180 feet above the Rotunda floor. To compensate for the distance from the floor to the ceiling, Brumidi, who spent years mastering depth and scale, painted 15-foot tall figures so that the work could be appreciated from the Rotunda floor.Another Brumidi masterpiece, ``The Frieze of American History,'' appears just underneath the dome and spans the entire 360 degrees of the Capitol Rotunda. The frieze, which initially looks to be carved or sculpted, as all who view it believe it to be three dimensional, was, in actuality, meticulously painted with the use of scaffolding. While Brumidi first sketched a design of the frieze in 1859, Congress did not authorize work to begin on this piece until 18 years later, in 1877.The work masterfully displays America's history, beginning with the landing of Christopher Columbus and continuing to the discovery of gold in California. While many visitors to the Capitol have seen Brumidi's genius in the frieze over the years, they may not realize that he nearly lost his life while painting it. While working on a figure of William Penn, 76-year-old Brumidi fell from the scaffolding, but saved himself by clinging to the rung of a ladder for 15 long minutes before he was rescued. While he subsequently ascended the scaffolding once more to continue his work, he died a few months later in 1880. It took two additional artists and 73 years to finish the masterpiece that Constantino Brumidi first began.Mr. Speaker, Constantino Brumidi's service to the Capitol, and our country, span the administration of six, six Presidents: Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes. On and on, Brumidi worked. All of us here in the Capitol that have the privilege of working in this living museum, as well as the millions of visitors that tour our building each year, who admire and relish Brumidi's works, but precious few know the story of the artist of the Capitol.In addition to awarding Constantino Brumidi with the Congressional Gold Medal, S. 254 directs the Architect of the Capitol to display the gold medal as an exhibition in the new visitor's center dedicated to Brumidi's life and work. I believe such an exhibit is long past due and would be to the benefit of future generations of Americans who come to see the Capitol and admire the brilliant works of Constantino Brumidi, reminding us yet again that we are a Nation built by immigrants.Mr. Speaker, Constantino Brumidi was a great son of Italy and a great American. His achievements are a great source of pride for Italian Americans, and S. 254 would bestow Brumidi, and the Italian American community, with the recognition the artist's great contributions so rightly deserve.Special thanks are due to Representative Bill Pascrell from New Jersey, the main sponsor of this bill that we have before us in the House today.And I'd like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of somebody who visits us here in the gallery today, Mr. Speaker, Joseph Grano, who's the president of the Constantino Brumidi Society, for his long and tireless efforts on this behalf.Mr. Speaker, this is a great day for those who love fine art, creativity, American history, and who appreciate the contributions of Italian American immigrants and all immigrants for the culture and history of our country.I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Dale Leon Vincent, Jr., an outstanding father, brother, husband, and a friend to many. Regrettably, Dale passed away earlier this year and left us too soon.Dale's life was devoted to his family, his country, and his community. These values were instilled in him at an early age. His father, Dale L. Vincent, Sr., was a career officer in the Chemical Corps of the U.S. Army, serving in the European theater during World War II, and assisting U.S. humanitarian efforts after the liberation of Nazi concentration camps. Despite constantly moving from school to school each time his father's orders changed, Dale was a model student who devoted himself to his studies and to serving others. Dale reached the highest level of the Boy Scouts, becoming an Eagle Scout and earning the God and Country award. After graduating with honors from Washington-Lee High School in Arlington, Virginia, where he was a highly ranked member of the wrestling team, Dale attended Duke University and became a member of the Delta Sigma Phi fraternity. At Duke, Dale would meet the love of his life, Kathy Sarah Farmer.Following his father's example of service, Dale volunteered for service in the U.S. Army and served honorably in Vietnam. Although, like many veterans, Dale did not like to discuss his experiences in Vietnam, he was greatly admired by his family and friends for volunteering to serve his country despite the great risks. Dale was a first lieutenant in the Signal Corps, received an Army Commendation Medal for service as an instructor at Fort Benning, and, later, a Bronze Star for service in Vietnam. Upon returning home, Dale earned an MBA at American University in Washington, DC, and married his college sweetheart, Kathy.Dale became a successful businessman and entrepreneur in New York City, where he formed a number of companies and displayed a talent for innovation. Over the years, Dale created and ran two successful retail chains, Clubmart and Dress to the Nines. He owned a restaurant in New Hope, Pennsylvania, called ``The Raven,'' managed technology investing at Associated Capital, and was CEO of Mangosoft, a leading software company.Despite Dale's tremendous success as a businessman, his family was his greatest pride. Dale and Kathy raised and were devoted parents to three children, James, Paul, and David. Dale's younger brothers both so looked up to him that they each became Eagle Scouts, went to Duke University, joined Delta Sigma Phi, and served in the U.S. Armed Forces, as well.Dale Vincent's impact on those he shared his life with is truly immeasurable, but is apparent in the family and friends that love him so dearly. For his outstanding devotion to family, friends, and country, I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to please join me in honoring Dale Leon Vincent, Jr.",

    "text": "Madam Chair, I rise today in support of the Murphy Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act to repeal ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell.''The time to end this absurd policy is long past due. Since it was implemented in 1994, ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' has resulted in more than 13,000 gay and lesbian servicemembers being discharged for no reason other than their sexual orientation. As the United States has fought wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq, hundreds of mission-critical troops, including crucial Arabic and Farsi linguists, have been discharged because the Department of Defense believed they were gay. Such blatant discrimination is both morally wrong and, from a practical perspective, self-defeating.Last year, I received a letter from a gay soldier from Long Island who has bravely served our nation for more than twenty years in two branches of our military. Throughout his numerous tours of duty in Afghanistan and in Iraq, he has earned multiple bronze stars. Although he could retire, he did not want to leave the military when our nation needed him most. So, he volunteered for another combat zone deployment.In his letter, this soldier told me that he has served side-by-side with gay soldiers from the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia and has seen no evidence to suggest that these nations, which have no discriminatory policies against gay and lesbian servicemembers, have a problem with unit cohesion. In fact, an openly gay officer from Australia with whom he served was decorated with a U.S. medal at the end of his tour.This soldier concluded by asking if, after looking at his service record, I thought the military and our nation would be better off without his service. My answer is absolutely not. I thank him for his service and proudly cast my vote to allow him and all other gay and lesbian servicemembers to continue their service to our nation without living in fear of being discharged for simply being who they are. Our service men and women deserve a policy that honors the principles they protect. I stand with our nation's principles. I support the Murphy amendment.",

    "title": "NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011",
    "text": "Madam Chair, several months ago I received a letter from a solider who lives in New York. The letter was very similar to those that many members of Congress receive from brave servicemen and women who reside in their districts. The letter spoke of multiple tours through Iraq and Afghanistan, of volunteering for more service even after completing enough tours to retire, and of the pride of a soldier who loves his country and is willing to sacrifice so much to defend it.But this letter was not quite the same as those that many of us here in the Capitol receive from time to time. You see, despite serving his country for more than 20 years, despite volunteering to serve in a combat zone to defend America's principles of freedom from tyranny and from persecution, and despite receiving two bronze stars for meritorious service to his country, the gay soldier who wrote this letter is required by United States law to lie about who he is or face being discharged from the military.For 16 years, ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' has placed an unthinkable and immoral burden on gay and lesbian servicemen and women, who, under United States law and unlike their heterosexual counterparts, must hide their sexual orientation and their partners from the military. Their partners are not eligible for the military spousal benefits to which the partners of heterosexual servicemen and women are entitled, including health care and better housing. Madame Speaker, ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' is, by definition, a discriminatory policy.In the course of tonight's debate, several members have characterized the House of Representatives' impending vote to repeal ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' as a step forward for morality and equality. And it is. But, before we collectively pat ourselves on the back for a job well done, I would remind my colleagues that tonight's step forward is only a result of the giant leap backwards we took when we instituted the policy in the first place. Years from now, when our children read about ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' in their history books, what will they think of a government that so shamefully turned its back on gay servicemen and women in the interest of a political compromise?Madam Chair, politics is a business of grays. Seldom do we have the opportunity to vote on legislation that is black or white, moral or immoral, right or wrong. Tonight is the rare exception.For the thousands of gay servicemen and women who so bravely serve our country everyday but who live in constant fear of being discovered for who they are, for the principles of freedom and equality upon which the United States of America was founded, and in the interest of righting a wrong that has persisted for far too long, I rise in support of the amendment before us and for the patriotic soldier whose letter I enclose for the record; a letter in which he implores me: ``If and when this issue ever comes up for debate, and even for a vote in Congress, I respectfully ask you to remember all the gay military personnel who are right now risking our lives to defend the U.S. and its values.''Madam Chair, that moment has come.Dear Congressman Ackerman: I am a captain in the United States Army Reserve, and am presently deployed to Afghanistan. I am writing to you with regard to the military's so-called ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' (DADT) policy. As you may know, there is currently a strong push in Congress to overturn DADT--under which otherwise qualified gay men and women are still being involuntarily dismissed from service-- and replace it with a policy of nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. I strongly support this proposed policy change. I would like to explain the basis for my judgment. I am a veteran of both the U. S. Navy Reserve and the U. S. Army Reserve. In the latter I have served as both a sergeant and as a commissioned officer. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 I have completed tours of duty in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kuwait. I was informed that I had completed twenty good years of Reserve military service, and had thus earned the right to retire. But I did not want to retire with my country still at war. So I volunteered for another combat zone deployment, and am serving once again in Afghanistan. I have been at my current duty station------. I recite this brief resume to let you know that I am no mere observer of the military, but rather someone who has dedicated much of my life to our national defense. Congressman Ackerman, I am also one of the many gay military personnel who have served our country faithfully in these times of terrorism and war. I want to give you my personal perspective on why DADT is so wrong. First of all, it is widely recognized that a married service member's relationship with his or her spouse has a profound impact on that service member's fitness for duty. Thus, straight married service members are free, within the limits of resource availability and operational constraints, to maintain communications with their spouses. In fact, such communication is actively encouraged. Regular phone calls, e- mail, and postal letters really help both the service member and spouse get through the strain of combat zone deployments in particular. Many gay service members have committed partners who, every day, face the same stress and make the same sacrifices as do their straight counterparts. But because of DADT, gay service members and their partners have to constantly worry that an overheard telephone call, an intercepted e-mail message, or other type of compromised communication could lead to a degrading, career-destroying investigation. It is wrong, I believe, to place such additional burdens on the back of American patriots. I write of these matters from personal experience. When the 9/11 terrorist attacks occurred I was in a serious long-term relationship. But the extensive post-9/11 active duty I performed put a serious strain on this relationship. The relationship finally fell completely apart during my first Afghanistan deployment in------. As you may know, the military has seen a troubling increase in the service member suicide rate since 9/11. Furthermore, the loss of a serious relationship is one of the critical risk factors that may contribute to such suicides. I experienced this particular risk factor and my situation was compounded by its occurrence in a war zone. Six years later, I can still vividly remember cradling my government-issue pistol in my hands and fighting the urge to blow my own brains out. I made it through that crisis. I completed my mission in Afghanistan successfully, and in fact was decorated with a Bronze Star Medal at the conclusion of that tour. I went on to earn a second Bronze Star Medal in Iraq two years later, and was promoted to------ shortly after that. What made that crisis particularly difficult was the isolation imposed on me as a result of DADT. A straight Soldier in a comparable crisis could turn to his commander, his first sergeant, or a ``battle buddy'' for help and advice. But such avenues are legally closed to gay troops. If I, for example, had shared the details of my situation with my commander--a decent and honorable man--he would have been legally obligated to have initiated an investigation that would have heaped even more stress upon me, disrupted my unit's mission, and ultimately destroyed my career. I know that many would say that a gay service member in such a situation could go to a chaplain in confidentiality. I have great respect for our military chaplains and for all the good work that they do. But I also believe that no service member should feel forced to see a chaplain as his or her only option. Every service member should have the right to speak freely with a commander, a trusted noncommissioned officer, or a battle buddy. I assert this not only as an individual Soldier, but also as an officer with extensive experience as a platoon leader and company commander. When I have been in these command positions, I have had Soldiers share with me some very personal information about their families and home lives. I was glad that these Soldiers trusted me, and this bond of trust and openness enabled me to give each individual the counsel or moral support that was needed. But what about gay troops? They are legally deprived of such a relationship with a commander, a senior noncommissioned officer, or a battle buddy. This is wrong. These gay troops--especially those experiencing the stress of combat zone duty--deserve access to such relationships. The DADT policy shackles the hands of leaders like myself and prevents us from properly supporting all our troops. This policy puts service members and their loved ones at risk. DADT is a shameful blot on our national honor. I know that many are wary of a repeal of DADT. Perhaps some--particularly those who oppose homosexual conduct on religious grounds--see such a policy change as the equivalent of governmental approval of homosexual conduct. But this is not so. Let me strike an analogy. Many religious individuals are opposed, on biblical grounds, to divorce and remarriage. But persons who have divorced and remarried are plentiful in the armed services, and many serve alongside very conservative religious persons every day. Respecting divorced-and-remarried persons as military professionals does not mean one agrees with their personal life choices, or that the government is advocating such choices. To me, the main issue is that we respect personnel who serve their country honorably and who act with responsibility and integrity in their personal lives. For example, in the military we will punish a ``deadbeat dad'' who neglects to pay his child support, but we support and respect the divorced father who stays committed to his parental responsibilities. I believe that we need to take a comparable stance towards gay service members. There are also some who claim that repealing DADT will negatively impact morale and discipline in our armed services. But I have never seen a single shred of empirical evidence to support such assertions. In fact, the available evidence suggests that treating gay and straight troops equally has no negative impact on military forces. Consider the fact that many of our key allies in current combat and security operations--nations such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia--do not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in their armed services. These fighting forces continue to perform admirably. Furthermore, troops from these and other nondiscriminatory nations live and serve side by side every day with U.S. troops in war zones. On this current tour, for example, I personally have shared living and bathing facilities with uniformed personnel from Australia, Canada, Denmark, Spain, and the United Kingdom-- never have I seen a U.S. serviceman run shrieking from the showers because he feared that he might encounter an openly gay individual from one of these allied nations. Last year I met an openly gay chief petty officer from the Australian navy. He had served as part of a U.S.-led multinational team in Iraq. He told me that not only was his presence no problem for the Americans, but they decorated him with a U.S. medal at the end of his tour! Surely if Americans can accept a gay Australian, they can also accept gay fellow Americans. People who claim that the U.S. military cannot manage a policy of sexual orientation nondiscrimination are not only ignoring the realities of current operations, but they are also essentially saying that American service personnel are less professional than those of the U.K., Canada, and other nondiscriminatory nations--I consider such an assertion to be a highly offensive insult. Of course, my argument ultimately leads to a logical--and fair--question: How do we manage this change in policy? The answer is simple. Hold gay service members to exactly the same standards we hold straight service members. If gay individuals were to commit acts of sexual harassment, or engage in any other type of activity that goes contrary to military order, we would discipline them appropriately--and separate them from the service if necessary. This happens to straight service members when necessary; I myself once had to discipline a straight male noncommissioned officer for his inappropriate behavior towards a junior female Soldier. This NCO accepted my counsel, corrected his behavior, and completed his tour of duty successfully. On the other hand, those gay individuals who conduct themselves with honor and dignity, and who demonstrate respect for their fellow service members, would continue to do their jobs. This is exactly the policy that coalition militaries, many U. S. police departments, and dozens of civilian corporations have been following successfully for years. Are we really to believe that this course of action is beyond the capability of the U.S. military? In fact, I believe that the demise of DADT will happen as smoothly and quietly as did similar policy changes in the militaries of allied nations. Gay troops who have been behaving in a professional manner prior to the demise of DADT are not suddenly going to begin engaging in outrageous or disruptive behavior. Today's gay troops, despite the burdens of DADT, are putting their lives on the line every day to defend this country; many of us have been tested in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, and other challenging locations. If the military gets rid of DADT, we will continue to do our jobs and take care of our battle buddies; we and our commanders will simply have a terrible burden lifted from our shoulders. Congressman, after more than two decades of military service--at sea and on land, from the Cold War era to the Global War on Terror, in joint service and multinational environments--I think I know the women and men of our armed forces pretty well. I can tell you that every day U. S. service members overcome barriers of difference--difference in race, ethnic heritage, religion, regional origin, gender, socioeconomic class, and other areas. Sexual orientation is just another element in this complex equation. We are able to overcome all these types of difference and form cohesive teams by focusing on the basics: mutual respect, a solid work ethic, personal integrity, and commitment to our common missions. We are also able to recognize that a person whose difference may initially unsettle us may also possess a critical skill, a body of knowledge, or a depth of experience that we need to accomplish these common missions. Can we afford to lose a fluent Arabic linguist because she is a lesbian? Can we afford to discard a combat seasoned infantryman because he is gay? I have enclosed with this letter some documentation from my combat zone service. My contributions have been modest compared to the heroism shown by many of my sisters and brothers in arms. Still, I am proud of what I have achieved. I leave it to you to look at my record and determine whether or not the military would be better off if I--and, for that matter, thousands of people like me--were to be involuntarily dismissed from duty. I am an ordinary guy who grew up in New York. My dad is a retired New York City cop who was deeply impacted by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Like any other deployed Soldier, I call my folks at least once a week, and they worry about me just like the parents of any Soldier. I don't want to turn the military into some sort of gay utopia. I just want gay Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen--together with our loved ones--to have the sort of peace of mind that our straight sisters and brothers take for granted. Congressman Ackerman, I read on your Web site about how you stood up for Soldiers who were not getting their combat zone tax exemption in Iraq. So I know you are a leader who believes in taking care of the troops. Sir, I believe that now is the time to give troops like me relief from the injustice of ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell.'' If and when this issue comes up for debate, and even for a vote, in Congress, I respectfully ask you to remember all the gay military personnel who are right now risking our lives to defend the United States and its values. If you have any questions or comments about anything I have written, you may contact me via e-mail. And please feel free to share this letter and its enclosures, including my contact information, with any individuals or organizations whom you deem appropriate. Sincerely, ------.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Meeks amendment, which not only affects his district, but affects at least 11 congressional districts that surround his district, all in support of our veterans and fighting men and women who have returned from wars overseas, some of them severely injured and in need of our care, concern, and support at this very moment.For 7 years now, the Department of Veterans Affairs has pursued a perhaps well-intentioned but a stubbornly wrongheaded plan for the St. Albans Primary and Extended Care facility which is located in the county of Queens. I am very concerned that the VA is proceeding full speed ahead with its plans to lease a property for 34 years, property currently dedicated exclusively for veterans. And what are the veterans supposed to do for the next 75 years without this facility, when there is a rising demand among our veterans for medical services?The justification--you have to hear this--the justification for the VA's decision stems from an absurd outdated report that relied on data from 2003, 8 years ago, when we were only at the beginning of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have, unfortunately, seen tremendous increases in veterans homelessness, foreclosures, divorce, substance abuse, PTSD and, yes, suicides.And yet the VA report from all those years ago projected at that time, almost a decade ago, that mental health services for our veterans was going to decrease over the next 20 years. It's been 8 years since that report. And what have we seen during the 8 years alone? And there's 12 years more to go. We've seen increases in all of these problems among our veterans. And yet they cling stubbornly to the data in that report, thinking that these things are going to go down among our veterans. And this, everybody knows, is certainly not going to be the case.All evidence suggests that returning veterans are going to require a greater significant increase especially in VA mental health services. A Rand Center report alone found that already 18.5 percent of all U.S. servicemembers who have returned already from Afghanistan and Iraq currently suffer from PTSD or depression, and that 19.5 percent suffer from traumatic brain injury.Where is the Veterans Administration's common sense? To give away this property, which is intended and secured right now for our veterans, is a huge mistake, based on a report that is already discredited by the facts. This is something that we can't allow to continue.These are veterans who have sacrificed so much. We have to stand here today on the floor. And I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, colleagues in the majority especially, for seeing through the politics of this and understanding that these are our veterans that we are fighting for; that we, as Members of Congress, understand our constituencies and our needs and their needs.I want to personally thank Representatives Grimm and King, who are among our delegation, as well as the rest of the Democratic members of the delegation in our region, and thank Representative Meeks for his dynamic and great leadership in bringing this to our attention so that we could stand together as patriotic Americans all, at least on this issue, and fight for the needs of our veterans.I yield back the balance of my time.The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks).",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Evelyn Weinstein, beloved mother, grandmother, and wife, tireless advocate for the underprivileged, and friend to all who knew her. Regrettably, Evelyn passed away earlier this week.To say that Evelyn believed in giving back and paying forward would be an understatement--she devoted her entire life to helping the most vulnerable members of our society. The daughter of Polish immigrants, Evelyn worked hard to achieve the American Dream, graduating first from Brooklyn College and then going on to receive a Masters degree from Columbia University. Evelyn used her education and training to help others by becoming a certified psychiatric social worker in New York State.During World War II and its aftermath, she helped veterans and their families cope with the psychiatric issues of war and also assisted children with respiratory ailments. During her four-decade long career as a social worker, she was a stalwart advocate for patients, assisting thousands of them at Jamaica, Long Island Jewish and North Shore hospitals. She was also the director of Long Term Care Ombudservice, Nassau County, safeguarding the rights of nursing-home residents and helping families deal with the difficult transition of placing loved ones into elder-care facilities.Always the ardent activist, Evelyn was involved with many social agencies and organizations dedicated to assisting low income and vulnerable individuals, including: the Nassau Action Coalition, helping the aged and disabled and blind on Social Security Income; the Kimmel Housing Development Foundation, advocating for affordable housing; and the Social Action Committee of Temple Emanuel of Great Neck, serving as its chairperson. Evelyn also received numerous honors for her good works during her long and varied career, including: the American Jewish Congress Woman of the Year award, the Nassau County Social Worker of the Year award, and Nassau County Senior Citizen of the Year award.Evelyn met the love of her life, Jack Weinstein, while she was attending Brooklyn College. They married in 1946 after Jack's service in the U.S. Navy and had three sons, Seth, Michael, and Howard. Jack went on to become a federal district judge, then chief judge, in the Eastern District of New York. But before Jack could become one of the most distinguished jurists in the country, Evelyn worked nights as a social worker and helped care for their young son so that Jack could attend Columbia University law school.Evelyn was known for a lifetime of selfless devotion to her family, friends, coworkers, patients and clients. Her human touch and empathy for those in need led to the bettering of thousands of lives, not just through her own work, but also through her efforts of teaching people how to help people. She trained and supervised hundreds of social workers and volunteer ``ombudspeople'' along the way so that they could continue to ``pay forward'' what Evelyn had ``given back'' to her community. Evelyn was deeply committed to the concept of citizen representatives overseeing and engaging in government programs in their communities.Mr. Speaker, Evelyn's energy and compassion for helping the disadvantaged never wavered, never flagged. She is already sorely missed, but her gift of helping others, as well as inspiring all of us to help those less fortunate than us, will always endure. I ask all of our colleagues to rise and join me in honoring Evelyn Weinstein. ",

As has already been stated, there are no funds for Appalachian highways in the Transportation appropriations bill that passed the House earlier this week.This bill today, the Energy and Water appropriations bill, which has been so well crafted by the chairman, Joseph McDade and the ranking member Vic Fazio, includes $160 million for the Appalachian Regional Commission [ARC]. This bill represents a cut below the President's request and is less than half the amount appropriated 15 years ago. If non-Defense discretionary programs had been reduced like this, we would have a balanced budget this year.It is important to note that since the ARC was created over 30 years ago, the economic condition in the Appalachian Region has significantly improved. Poverty rates have been cut in half, infant mortality has been reduced by two-thirds, and good paying jobs have been created through infrastructure improvements.But our job is not done. Businesses are closing and others refusing to locate in northern Alabama due to the lack of a four-lane highway to connect the cities of Atlanta, Birmingham, and Memphis.For job creation and safety issues this is an unacceptable omission from our National Highway System.Economic growth is hampered because it is so difficult to transport goods and services between Birmingham and Memphis and throughout the northerwestern part of Alabama.The current inadequate two-lane route is extremely dangerous with a traffic incident or fatality occurring every month for the last 50 months.The ARC provides needed funds for highways located in the Appalachian Region like Corridor X, which is the proposed four-lane route from Memphis to Birmingham. These funds do not take resources away from the transportation trust funds, and are matched by each State.I understand the concern of the gentleman from Wisconsin and support eliminating Federal programs that are inefficient and wasteful. However, a closer look at the facts will demonstrate that funding for the ARC is crucial for the infrastructure and economic development of many rural areas including my congressional district.I urge my colleagues to defeat the Klug amendment and support H.R. 2203.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, for many of our country's poorest children, education is their one ticket out of poverty. In fact, even children in truly horrible schools manage to make it out of their destitution by relentless determination and plain old hard work.But, Mr. Speaker, children should not have to pass through metal detectors on their way through the schoolhouse door. If kids are more worried about becoming victims of violence than about getting an ``A'' on the next exam, how can we expect them to perform their best?Mr. Speaker, in the face of school violence and disorderly classrooms, to whom can the kids turn? Why, their parents, of course. But what if their parents lack the resources to pull them out of horrible schools?Mr. Speaker, while the special interests join together in saying too bad or offer up worthless promises, conservatives offer these kids hope in the form of school choice and education savings accounts.Mr. Speaker, hope is a commodity in short supply in many of our Nation's poorest communities. School choice and education savings accounts give kids and their parents a reason to hope.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize two schools in my district that have been recognized by the U.S. Department of Education for their achievements as Title I schools.These schools, Carlisle Elementary Schools in Boaz, Alabama and McCord Elementary School in Albertville, Alabama, were selected for this award through a competitive process coordinated and managed by the state education agency. The principals of these schools, Ms. Kim Mintz and Mr. Richard Cole respectively, deserve this national recognition for their unwavering dedication to the academic achievement of their students.Title I schools are located in high poverty areas and receive funding to improve teacher training and learning for at-risk children. These two schools and the 97 others in the nation that are also receiving these awards, are schools that have far exceeded expectations; they have truly gone the extra mile to give these children a chance to succeed. In turn, these children, supported by their families, have worked hard and set an example for students everywhere.The recognition is based on six criteria: opportunity for all children to meet proficient and advanced levels of performance; professional development for teachers and administrators; coordination with other programs; curriculum development and instruction to support achievement to high standards; partnerships developed among the school, parents, and the local community; and three years of successful achievement and testing data.The awards will be presented on May 2 in Indianapolis at the 2000 International Reading Association Conference. Mr. Speaker, I commend the faculty, staff, parents, and students for making these schools such a landmark of achievement in the State of Alabama.",

    "title": "CARL ELLIOTT FEDERAL BUILDING",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, it has already been stated tonight and it has been stated very eloquently some things about Congressman Carl Elliott, who served as an outstanding representative for Alabama and our Nation throughout his life.He was born to Will and Nora Massey Elliott of Vina, in Franklin County, Alabama, in 1913, and he tirelessly devoted himself to serving others. He was a 1936 graduate of the University of Alabama Law School and he was admitted to the practice in Alabama under the Alabama State Bar the same year. He also set up his law practice in Russellville, Alabama, in 1936 and later moved that practice to Jasper, Alabama, where he later served as judge of the Recorders Court.In June of 1940, Carl Elliott married Jane Hamilton, who remained his wife until her death in 1985. Through their years together, the couple raised four children, Carl, Jr., Martha, John and Lenora.Following military service in the Second World War, Carl Elliott rose quickly in public life and was elected to the 81st and seven succeeding Congresses beginning in 1948.From the first day he came to Washington, Carl Elliott began working on a bill for Federal aid for education. In every Congressional session from 1949 to 1958, Carl Elliott introduced some form of a student aid act, knowing that under the seniority system, his legislation might take years to get a hearing. Despite these challenges, Carl Elliott was undeterred in his strong desire to improve the quality of our Nation's education system, from the elementary and secondary level through higher education in our Nation's colleges and universities. This persistence paid off when he was appointed to the House Committee on Education and Labor in October of 1951, the committee on which Elliott is known for having done his greatest work in the House.But Carl Elliott knew it was not always politically popular for a Congressman to be a champion of our Nation's educational system. In his autobiography, The Cost of Courage, the Journey of an American Congressman, Elliott wrote that ``By stepping into the arena of the fight for Federal aid to education, I was entering a battleground littered with nearly two centuries of corpses. Only twice in America's history had the Federal Government been able to pass laws that significantly and directly provided aid to the Nation's schools. The first was the passage of the Northwest Ordinance in 1787, which set aside public lands for elementary and secondary schools. The second came in 1962, when Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill Act, which provided land grants for state universities.''As chairman of the Education and Labor Subcommittee on Special Education, Carl Elliott saw that wherever he went, he was told the same thing that he had already known for quite some time, that something needed to be done to strengthen our educational system, particularly in the fields of science and technology. This need became dramatically clear in our Nation when Sputnik I was launched by the Soviet Union in October of 1957. With its strange beeping sound heard by millions of Americans as it orbited the Earth that month, Americans realized that there was a tremendous need to increase our scientific and technical knowledge base to win the space race and eventually win the Cold War.When the House convened in 1958, Carl Elliott's number one priority was passage of his bill, the National Defense Education Act. This historic legislation established loans to students at our Nation's colleges and universities, and provided financial assistance for strengthening education by authorizing Federal grants to States to purchase equipment for science and mathematics instruction.The National Defense Education Act helped to strengthen math and science instruction at a critical time in our Nation's race to the Moon and our eventual victory in the Cold War under Presidents Reagan and Bush.Carl Elliott was also responsible for the Library Services Act, which brought libraries to rural communities, and even now provides millions of dollars in Federal assistance for low-income elementary, secondary and college level students.As a member of the House Committee on Rules, Elliott worked for progressive social legislation and took a stand on racial issues during a time in the South when such a stand was anything but popular.Despite his Congressional defeat in 1964, Carl Elliott continued his career in public life, serving as a member of President Johnson's Library Commission in 1967 and 1968. He also served under Presidents Johnson and Nixon as Chairman of the Public Evaluation Committee, Office of Technical Services, and a member of the Technical Advisory Board within the Department of Commerce.Although elected and appointed to high office throughout his career, Elliott never forgot his roots, resuming his law practice in Jasper until his death on January 9 of last year. Two of Elliott's children, Martha Elliott Russell and Lenora Russell Cannon, who currently live in Jasper, are still living today, and also I just found out today that his grandson, William Russell, is working now on Capitol Hill.In 1990, Carl Elliott was given what is perhaps the greatest honor of his career when he was named the first recipient of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. Created by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation to encourage elected officials to show courage in their political leadership, more than 5,000 people were nominated, but only one person was chosen, and that was Carl Elliott.In his autobiography, Carl Elliott himself best summed it up, and, as the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) eloquently put it tonight and it is the way he said it best in his book in the Profile in Courage speech, ``There were those who said that I was ahead of my time. But they were wrong. I believe that I always was behind the times that ought to be.''To honor Carl Elliott's long and distinguished career, I am proud to introduce H.R. 4806 to designate the Federal building located at 1710 Alabama Avenue in Jasper, Alabama, as the Carl Elliott Federal Building. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. I believe it will serve as a fitting tribute to a great leader who truly made a difference in making the lives of Americans in his era and in our own better than they would have been without his leadership.I had an opportunity to personally know Carl Elliott. As a college student I was working on a term paper and I went to see the former Congressman to discuss the topic that I was working on, the history of Winston County. He sat down with me, he was helpful, he was sincere, and he took time to help a student who needed his help.It is only fitting and proper that we honor Carl Elliott through this legislation.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise today to oppose the amendment by the gentlemen from Arizona and Michigan, both fine and excellent Members of this body, but like many Americans, I am concerned that gambling is a panacea for the real problems of poverty on Indian reservations. As gambling has become more and more a part of Native American policy, investment in Federal programs intended to improve the health and welfare of tribes has declined.While the intent of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was to allow Native Americans to lift themselves out of poverty through self-reliance, today nearly 80 percent of Native Americans do not receive anything from gambling revenues. The reality is that most tribes, which are located in areas not economically viable for a casino, live in poverty.The National Indian Gaming Commission, which is now in the bill, would be struck by this amendment. This would be unfortunate because the Indian Gaming Commission would undertake a study of a number of problems which impact the Native American community, including the welfare of Native Americans, including health, infrastructure, housing, economic development and educational opportunities; the relationship between tribal entities and nontribal communities; and regulations that govern tribal gaming to produce potential for abuse or exploitation by organized crime and the gaming industry.This commission, I believe, provides a much-needed review of Federal policy on Native Americans. Given the current state of affairs, I urge my colleagues to preserve the National Indian Gaming Commission and to oppose the Hayworth-Kildee amendment.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the work of a great American, Phyllis Schlafly. Mrs. Schlafly was named one of the 100 most important women of the 20th century by the Ladies' Home Journal, and has been a national leader of the conservative movement since the publication of her bestselling 1964 book, A Choice Not An Echo.Mrs. Schlafly has been a leader of the pro-family movement since 1972, when she started her national volunteer organization now called Eagle Forum. In a ten-year battle, she led the profamily movement to victory over the principal legislative goal of the radical feminists, called the Equal Rights Amendment. An articulate and successful opponent of the radical feminist movement, she appears in debate on college campuses more frequently than any other conservative.Mrs. Schlafly's monthly newsletter called The Phyllis Schlafly Report is now in its 36th year. Her syndicated column appears in 100 newspapers, her radio commentaries are heard daily on 460 stations, and her radio talk show on education called ``Phyllis Schlafly Live'' is heard weekly on 45 stations. Both can be heard on the internet.In addition, she is the author or editor of 21 books on subjects as varied as family (The Power of the Positive Woman) and feminism (Feminist Fantasies), nuclear strategy (Strike From Space and Kissinger on the Couch), education (Child Abuse in the Classroom), and child care (Who Will Rock the Cradle?). Her recent book, Turbo Reader, is a system to enable every parent to teach his child to read.Mrs. Schlafly is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Washington University, received her J.D. from Washington University Law School, and received her Master's in Political Science from Harvard University. She is a lawyer who served on the Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution appointed by President Reagan, has testified before more than 50 Congressional and State Legislative committees on constitutional, national defense, and family issues.The mother of six children and an Illinois Mother of the Year, Mrs. Schlafly is America's best-known advocate of the dignity and honor that we as a society owe to the role of fulltime homemaker.Phyllis Schlafly was honored in 2002 by Focus on the Family as the Mother of the Profamily Movement, and in 2003) she was the honoree at dinners hosted by the Council for National Policy and the Conservative Political Action Committee. She has since 1972 traveled at least annually to Alabama to debate and speak eloquently on issues that affect the family.The Alabama Policy Institute, Christian Coalition of Alabama, and the Southeast Law Institute have joined the Eagle Forum of Alabama to honor Mrs. Schlafly and express their admiration, appreciation, and affirmation of her exemplary service to God, family and country. As President Ronald Reagan said: ``Our nation needs the kind of volunteer service you and Eagle Forum have demonstrated . . .'' And as American Conservative Union Chairman David Keene said in a statement this year about Mrs. Schlafly: ``If there are giants among us, you are certainly one. The movement of which we are all part would never have achieved the successes it has without you . . . you had the courage to be `conservative before it was cool'. . . the fact that so many young people are attracted to our banner today is a tribute to your work.''I stand with these groups and individuals to honor Phyllis Schlafly for her service to our country and culture, and her commitment to conservative family values.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today we are considering, as has already been said, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. I have joined with 161 Members in cosponsoring this legislation, and I commend the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) for bringing forward this legislation. This is the fifth Congress during which this debate has taken place, four of which I have been a part of, and I believe an overwhelming majority of Americans hope this will be the last and that we will pass this bill and have it sent to the President and signed into law.I know that it has been repeated time and time again here on the floor of the House, but this afternoon I think it is important to remind my colleagues of the details of this deplorable procedure. Partial-birth abortion is a procedure in which the mother's cervix is forcibly dilated over a 3-day period. On the third day the child is pulled feet first through the birth canal until his or her entire body, except for the head, is outside the womb. While the fetus is stuck in this position, dangling partly out of the mother's body and just a few inches from taking its first breath, the physician inserts and opens scissors into the base of the baby's skull, creating a hole in the baby's head.The physician then either crushes the baby's skull with instruments or suctions out the baby's brain. With the head now small enough to slip through the mother's cervix, the physician pulls the now-lifeless body the rest of the way out of its mother, and discards the baby's body as medical waste. Today you will hear some supporters of partial-birth abortion claim this procedure is a critical alternative that must remain legal to protect women's health. However, the medical profession offers no support for such claims.I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill to protect the most vulnerable in our Nation.",

    "title": "TRIBUTE TO STATE REPRESENTATIVE ALLEN LAYSON",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor State Representative Allen Layson on the occasion of his retirement from the Alabama House of Representatives. Allen is a man who embodies the American principles of hard work, dedication to one's family and service to one's country. I am honored to stand before this body of Congress and this Nation to recognize his many accomplishments.Allen was born on December 16, 1931 in Eatonton, Georgia. He graduated from Eatonton High School in 1947. He entered the United States Army Reserves in 1948 and volunteered for active duty service in 1951 and was discharged in 1953. Immediately after leaving the Army, Allen attended the University of Georgia and earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in Forestry in just three years, graduating in 1956.Allen and his family moved to Pickens County in 1969, and he soon demonstrated his outstanding leadership to the Reform community. He served as president of the Reform Rotary Club, is the founder of the Reform Area Public Library, is a member of the American Legion, a member of the Pickens County Mental Health Association, a Master Mason, and a member of the Boy Scout Troop Committee. First elected to the Alabama House of Representatives in 1986, Allen has served the Sixty-First district with distinction for the past twenty years. During his tenure he was a strong proponent of our Second Amendment rights and worked hard to protect the family and our religious liberties. A social and fiscal conservative, he voted consistently to ensure that Alabama provided an economic atmosphere in which business and industry could grow and prosper.Allen is a true friend of the volunteer fire fighter. Through his efforts, a three mil revenue tax was enacted in 1999, and amended in 2004, to provide badly needed funding to the volunteer fire departments in Pickens County. This funding allows the volunteer fire departments to purchase equipment, provide training and cover operating costs. This has greatly enhanced their firefighting capabilities, thus reducing insurance rates and thereby saving money for Alabama families.He served as a Commissioner on the Alabama Forestry Commission from 1979 to 1983, served as president of the Alabama Division for the Society of American Foresters, is a Trustee of the Alabama Forest Products Workman's Compensation Fund, served as president and is a lifetime member of the Alabama Wildlife Federation, is a member of the Alabama Cattlemen's Association, a member of the Sierra Club and a member of sixteen volunteer fire departments. Also, Allen has served on the board of directors for the Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway Development Authority since his appointment by Governor Guy Hunt in 1991.He has been distinguished as the recipient of the Governor's Conservationist of the Year Award in Forestry in 1982, the Kelly Mosley Environmental Award in 1985 and the APA Southwestern United States Technical Writing Award in 1981.Of all of Allen's accomplishments, perhaps his greatest achievement was convincing the former JoAnn Kimberly to marry him. They were married on September 15, 1949 and are the proud parents of five children; Butch, Allen, Jr., Kim, James and Michael. Allen and JoAnn are faithful members of Reform First United Methodist Church where Allen has served as a Lay Leader and Lay Speaker.Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege to honor State Representative Allen Layson for his many achievements and his enduring impact on his country, state, community, friends and family. He is a man of great dignity and character who takes pride in the accomplishments of those he has helped over the years. Allen is an inspiring role model for all of us and I join his family, friends and colleagues in wishing him God's richest blessings in his retirement.",

    "title": "TRIAL OF WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
    "text": "Mr. Chief Justice and esteemed colleagues, I rise to offer my thoughts on the momentous decision we will render shortly. At the start, I deeply regret that the American people have been denied the opportunity to hear the Senate's final deliberations on the impeachment charges against President Clinton. I say this because I have been thoroughly impressed with the thought, tenor, and passion brought to this deliberation by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I wish the American people could have the opportunity to observe what I have had the privilege of witnessing for the past two days. Whether seated in the gallery, watching on television, listening on radio, or following on-line, the public would have benefitted tremendously from the opportunity to hear, in real time and full context each of our remarks. The opportunity to read a transcript later this week in the Record will not come close to viewing these proceedings. It lacks the power of the moment.when I took the oath to do impartial justice on January 7, 1999, I knew, as one of 100 Senators, that I was assuming the unique role of judge and juror in the Senate impeachment trial of William Jefferson Clinton. Over these weeks, I have listened to the presentations by the House Managers, the White House counsel, and the President's defense team without prejudice. I have analyzed the video testimony of Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan, and Sidney Blumenthal, and read numerous grand jury transcripts, the referral from the Independent Counsel, and the House report and related documents.The House of Representatives approved two articles of impeachment by straight party line votes after bitter and divisive partisan debate, forwarding to the Senate the impeachment articles to remove the President of the United States as authorized by the Constitution. At the same time, the partisan nature of the House action invites challenge to its legitimacy. And, although we have more often than not voted along party lines during the impeachment trial, I am proud of this body and its genuine effort to pursue a bipartisan course during our trial of the President. We have disagreed without being disagreeable.The body has not strayed too far from the comity and tone that marked our first bipartisan caucus to set the framework for this proceeding.We have taken the admonition of the senior Senator from West Virginia to heart and avoided descending into the pit of caustic partisanship and recrimination.After reviewing volumes of evidence and weighing weeks of presentations before the Senate, I have concluded that a case has not been made on either of the articles of impeachment against President Clinton. Conviction and removal from office, as charged by the House Managers, is simply not warranted. The record does not sustain the level of proof necessary to convict and remove the President. Certain facts are indisputable: the President lied to the American people and to his wife and daughter about an extramarital affair; he lied to his staff; and he was misleading in his deposition in the Jones v. Clinton civil suit and his grand jury testimony.However, impeachment is not a Constitutional means to punish a President ``when he gets out of bounds,'' as proposed by the House Managers. The constitutional standard is whether high crimes and misdemeanors were committed, and that test has not been met.In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee rejected an article of impeachment against President Nixon based on the filing of a false tax return. I was reasoned that the President's misleading tax return was unrelated to his duties as president, although a minority believed the count was unsupported by the evidence. Thus we see that all crimes that may be punishable by the courts are not punishable by impeachment.Rather, impeachment is narrowly limited by the Constitution to offenses of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. After listening to many presentations on this issue, I am convinced that impeachment and removal from office should only be used for crimes against the country or threats to our national security.Our founding fathers carefully defined the terms of impeachment in a manner that establishes a high threshold and requires the charges to be of an egregious nature. That is why the Senate has only once before held an impeachment trial for a President.The House Managers recommend impeachment because it is the only way in which the President's misconduct can be punished. Yet, I remind my colleagues that the President remains subject to criminal and civil penalties after he leaves office in two years.As I will point out, the facts and other evidence accumulated and presented to the Senate do not meet the constitutional standard for impeachment and removal that our founding fathers established.Article One charges the President with perjury before the grand jury in August 1998, for willfully giving false testimony under oath in a judicial proceeding. Yet to prove this charge the House Managers introduced material from the Jones suit during their Senate presentation even though the House rejected an article of impeachment dealing with Paula Jones suit. Nonetheless, despite this blurring of the lines between criminal and civil matters, a perjury conviction requires that the testimony be material to the case at hand. Judge Susan Webber Wright's rulings in the Jones case specifically excluded evidence concerning Monica Lewinsky because it was immaterial.Furthermore, Thomas Sullivan, former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, testified before the House Judiciary Committee that perjury ``can be particularly arcane, including the requirements that the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew his testimony to be false at the time he or she testified, that the alleged false testimony was material, and that any ambiguity or uncertainty about what the question or answer meant must be construed in favor of the defendant.'' Mr. Sullivan also noted that generally, ``federal prosecutors do not use the criminal process in connection with civil litigation involving private parties,'' because, ``there are well established remedies available to civil litigants who believe perjury or obstruction has occurred.''Article Two charges the President with seven different instances of obstruction of justice. The House Managers insist that the evidence shows that these separate acts constitute a deliberate attempt by the President to obstruct justice. The White House argues that the President did not seek to influence witnesses nor impede discovery. Legal scholars have argued that the lumping together of these seven charges would cause most courts to throw out the charges, and witness testimony undermines the House charges. After the smoke cleared from the charges and countercharges, it was evident to me that the connections between the actions of the President and the actions by the witnesses were circumstantial, at best.Moreover, I agree with White House counsel Charles F. Ruff, who in his closing arguments said of the House Managers, ``I believe their vision to be too dark, a vision too little attuned to the needs of the people, too little sensitive to the needs of our democracy.''In the obstruction of justice count, the Managers charge the President with asking Monica Lewinsky to lie, a charge that she denies in two dozen depositions, and testimony given under the protection of immunity. There is no evidence that the President ever asked her to provide a false affidavit in the Jones case or to testify falsely. Vernon Jordan, the President's close friend and advisor, testified that although he met with Ms. Lewinsky and was given a draft of the affidavit, he refused to review the document and referred the young woman to her attorney for advice and counsel.The House Managers say the President is guilty of obstructing justice when he ordered his secretary, Betty Currie, to retrieve gifts given by the President to Monica Lewinsky. However, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, on a number of occasions, indicates that it was she who asked Mrs. Currie to keep the gifts, not the President.The House states that the President asked Vernon Jordan to intensify an on-going job search in Ms. Lewinsky's behalf after Judge Webber Wright ruled that Paula Jones's attorney could investigate the President's sexual relations with state or federal employees.Lewinsky first met in November 1997, a month before Ms. Lewinsky was listed as a witness in the Jones case. Sinister motives do not appear to be involved in the inquiries by Mr. Jordan on her behalf that led to two job rejections and one job offer. Efforts by the House Managers to link the job search and the affidavit unravel when the dates on which Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky first met, when Ms. Lewinsky's name first appeared on the Paula Jones case witness list, and the drafting of the affidavit are analyzed.The President, Ms. Lewinsky, and Mr. Jordan have testified that no one was seeking Ms. Lewinsky's silence, and Ms. Lewinsky further testified that she realized in October 1997 that she would not be returning to the White House for employment and she renewed her job search in New York City.The additional testimonies of Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Jordan, and Mr. Blumenthal added no new information to the case against the President. I voted against deposing these witnesses since they already had been deposed many times.Moreover, we each received thousands of pages of testimony from the grand jury, various depositions, statements given under oath, and documents relating to the impeachment charges. We know that Ms. Lewinsky had been questioned on at least 23 separate occasions, including after the President's grand jury testimony and as recently as January 22, 1999, by the House prosecutors before testifying February 1, 1999, on video. During arguments in favor of deposing Ms. Lewinsky, House Manager Bryant urged the deposition because he believed the Senate should observe her demeanor, her tone, and her tenor in responding to questions.I respectfully disagreed with Mr. Bryant then, as I do now. My decision was bolstered when I viewed Ms. Lewinsky's videotaped testimony in which she reaffirmed her grand jury testimony. I saw no purpose in bringing her to the witness table again, nor Mr. Jordan, who had been questioned five times, nor Mr. Blumenthal, who has answered questions under oath four times. These witnesses did not change their testimonies, nor did they provide information that was omitted in previous testimony.The witnesses' statements are a matter of record, and they comprise thousands of pages encompassed in the volumes of testimony and sworn affidavits that are the basis of the House articles of impeachment. I concur with House majority counsel David Schippers who said during the House Judiciary impeachment proceedings, ``As it stands, all of the factual witnesses are uncontradicted and amply corroborated.''In conclusion, I cannot overstate my disappointment with the actions of the President. He deliberately misled the American people and greatly diminished the public's trust in the office of the presidency. However, I have concluded that the two articles of impeachment, as drafted and presented by the House, fail to meet the level of high crimes and misdemeanors, and I will vote to acquit the President.",

    "title": "STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS",
    "text": "Mr. President, today marks the 116th birthday of Dr. George Papanicolaou, who developed one of the most effective cancer screening tests in medical history--the Pap smear. Cervical cancer was one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in women in the United States 50 years ago and it is still a major killer of women worldwide. I rise today to introduce the Investment in Women's Health Care Act, a bipartisan bill to increase the reimbursement for Pap smear laboratory tests under the Medicare program. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues--Senators Snowe, Murray and Collins.The inadequacy of current lab test reimbursement was brought to my attention by pathologists who alerted me to the significant cost-payment differential for Pap smear testing in Hawaii. According to the American Pathology Foundation, Hawaii is one of the 23 States where the cost of performing the test greatly exceeds the Medicare payment. In Hawaii, the cost ranges between $13.04 and $15.80. Yet the Medicare reimbursement rate is only $7.15.The large disparity between the reimbursement level and the actual cost of performing the test may force labs in Hawaii and around the Nation to discontinue Pap smear testing. The below-cost reimbursement may compel some labs to process tests faster and in higher volume to improve cost efficiency. This situation increases the risk of inaccurate results and can severely handicap patient outcomes.This bill would increase the a reimbursement rate for Pap smear labwork from its current $7.15 to $14.60--the national average cost of the test. This rate is important because it establishes a benchmark for many private insurers.Last year, we were successful in having language included in the omnibus appropriations conference report recognizing the large disparity between the costs incurred to provide the screening tests and the amount paid by Medicare. The conferees noted that data from laboratories nationwide indicates that the cost of providing the test averages $13.00 to $17.00, with the costs in some areas being higher. Accordingly, conferees urged the Health Care Financing Administration to increase Medicare reimbursement for Pap smear screening. Although HCFA has indicated a willingness to increase this payment, I am concerned that the adjustment the agency is considering may be significantly less than the costs incurred by most laboratories in providing this service. Therefore, my colleagues and I are compelled to reintroduce legislation that would implement what we believe to be an appropriate increase.Mr. President, no other cancer screening procedure is as effective for early detection of cancer as the Pap smear. Over the last 50 years, the incidence of cervical cancer deaths has declined by 70 percent due in large part to the use of this cancer detection measure. Evidence shows that the likelihood of survival when cervical cancer is detected in its earliest stage is almost 100 percent, if treatment and follow-up is timely. If the Pap smear is to continue as an effective cancer screening tool, it must remain widely available and reasonably priced for all women. Adequate payment is necessary to ensure women's continued access to quality Pap smears.I urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan legislation. Mr. President, I also ask consent the text of my bill be included in the Record.",

    "title": "THE CHALLENGE OF BIOTERRORISM",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to address the threat of bioterrorism to our Nation's security.President Bush has asked Vice President Cheney to ``oversee the development of a coordinated national effort so that we may do the very best possible job of protecting our people from catastrophic harm.'' He also asked Joseph Allbaugh, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to create an Office of National Preparedness to implement a national effort.On May 9, 2001, Attorney General Ashcroft testified before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that the Department of Justice is the lead agency and in sole command of an incident while in the crisis management phase, even if consequence management activities, such as casualty care and evacuation, are occurring at the same time. Clearly, FEMA and the Department of Justice need to work together to shoulder the burden of responding to a large scale event. What is unclear, however, is how the Department of Justice will know that its crisis management skills are needed during a bioterrorism event.When will a growing cluster of disease be recognized as a terrorist attack? How do we differentiate between a few individuals with the flu and a flu-like epidemic perpetrated by terrorists? When will it be called a crisis? When will the FBI or Justice be called in to handle the newly declared ``crisis?'' In the case of a bioterrorist attack, the response will most likely be the same as if it was a naturally occurring epidemic. The key question is not ``how to respond to an attack'' but ``are we prepared to respond to any unusual biological event?''What would happen if a bioterrorist attack occurred today? It would not be preceded by a large explosion. Rather, over the course of a few days or a couple of weeks, people would start to get sick. They would go to hospitals, doctor's offices, and clinics. Hopefully, a physician in one hospital would notice similarities between two or three cases and contact the local public health officials. Maybe another physician would do the same and maybe, finally, the Center for Disease Control would be notified. So, the first responders would not be a Federal agency.Across the country, local law enforcement, fire, HAZ MAT and emergency medical personnel are doing a tremendous job preparing and training for terrorist attacks, and I commend their efforts. But, in the scenario I described, they would not be our first line of defense. Instead, the first responders for a biological event would be the physicians and nurses in our local hospitals and emergency rooms. We need to ensure that hospitals and medical professionals are prepared to deal with this threat. This is not the case today.This past November, emergency medical specialists, health care providers, hospital administrators, and bioweapon experts met at the Second National Symposium on Medical and Public Health Response to BioTerrorism. A representative of the American Hospital Association, Dr. James Bentley, spoke about the challenges hospitals are confronting and stated that ``we have driven over the past twenty years to reduce flexibility and safeguards.'' Flexibility and safeguards are exactly what is needed by a hospital to go from ``normal'' to ``surge'' operations. Surge operations do not require the extreme scenario of thousands of casualties from a bioweapon. Dr. Thom Mayer, chief of the emergency department at Inova Fairfax Hospital, was quoted in the Washington Post, on April 22, 2001, stating that 20 or 30 extra patients can throw an emergency department into full crisis mode.Dr. J.B. Orenstein, an emergency room physician, in a recent Washington Post op-ed, wrote about the ``State of Emergency'' the dedicated men and women working in our hospitals and clinics are already facing without the added worry of bioterrorism. Until a year ago, hospitals dealt with surges for only a few days or a week a year during the winter flu, cold and icy sidewalk season. Now, mini-surges occur in the spring, summer and fall due to decreasing numbers of emergency rooms, beds available in any hospital, and qualified nurses. On May 9, 2001, the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine convened a special meeting in Atlanta to discuss ``The Unraveling Safety Net.'' Are we, with all the planning and funding the Federal Government has done over the past few years to address terrorism, providing sufficient help for hospitals to prepare for bioevents?As Chairman of the Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services, I am concerned that we are not addressing a fundamental problem. Would a biological event be a national security/law enforcement incident with public health concerns, or would it be a public health crisis with a law enforcement component? I hope that the effort led by Vice President Cheney will address specifically this question and that the unique problems biological weapons present are not overlooked by any national plan to counter terrorism. I ask unanimous consent that the text of Dr. Orenstein's article be printed in the Record.",

    "text": "Mr. President, as the government moves to protect its citizens, harden its borders, and defends American interests abroad, I want to make sure that the Nation's Federal employees are given the resources and support needed to carry out these missions.Numerous studies point to the government's inability to compete with the private sector as one reason why we are unable to attract and retain qualified Federal employees. With a few exceptions, since 1981, military and Federal personnel have received equal pay increases. Yet, the administration's FY03 budget calls for an across-the-board adjustment of only 2.6 percent, while the military would receive a 4.1 percent increase. The proposed 2.6 percent increase is less than the formula used by the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act and fails to close the pay gap between Federal and private sector workers.In my capacity as Chairman of both the Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services and the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, I am actively involved in issues relating to Federal employees. Our civilian workforce plays a significant role in the support of our service members on active duty, in the reserves, and serving with the National Guard. I support a cohesive and coordinated effort in safeguarding America and believe a strong civilian workforce is crucial to our success in protecting our country.By 2005, over half the Federal workforce will be eligible to retire, and as long as fewer young people are choosing Federal service to fill these gaps, there should be a commitment from the highest levels of government to ensure that agencies are adequately staffed with the right people and the right skills to run the government in an effective and efficient manner.The American people know that the war on terrorism will be a long struggle; a different kind of war with fronts both at home and abroad. Our civilian Federal workforce is on the front line of this war and must be prepared to respond to the possibility of attack. We should not distinguish between our civilian and military workforces, both of whom serve their country with equal dedication.",

    "title": "HONORING CONGRESSWOMAN PATSY T. MINK",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to offer a few words in tribute to a distinguished colleague and dear friend, Congresswoman Patsy Takemoto Mink, who passed away Saturday afternoon in Honolulu, HI. I am deeply saddened by the passing of my friend and colleague, Patsy Mink, and I join our Congressional delegation, and the people of Hawaii and the Nation in extending heartfelt sympathy to John and Wendy Mink, her husband and daughter, Eugene Takemoto, her brother, and all of Patsy's extended family and her loyal staff in Washington and Hawaii.I feel a tremendous sense of loss at the untimely death of Congresswoman Patsy Takemoto Mink. Her passing leaves a void in the House of Representatives, the Hawaii congressional delegation, and the political life of our Nation. It is difficult to put her spirit into words, but those that come immediately to mind as fitting characterizations of the woman we honor today include courageous, forthright, tenacious, gutsy, outspoken, bold, meticulous, and determined. She was my friend, a dedicated public servant for Hawaii, a strong pillar in our state's delegation, and an advocate for those in America who feel scared, small, alone, mistreated, neglected or forgotten.Patsy was a petite woman with a powerful voice and a peerless reputation as a champion for equal opportunity, civil rights, and education. She was a courageous and tenacious leader whose lifetime of public service made Hawaii a better place. Her leadership in health, education, child welfare, and social services will endure and continue to benefit Hawaii's people and all Americans.In the course of her life, Patsy was a pioneer, a trailblazer for women, workers, minorities, the poor, and the powerless. In the history of Hawaii and our Nation in the 20th century, Patsy Mink is one of the giants whose vision of hope and passion for justice led Hawaii to statehood and whose efforts broke down barriers and opened doors to opportunity for everyone, regardless of race, gender, or religion. Her passing silences a dynamic voice, but her many accomplishments, her unimpeachable integrity, and passion for justice stand as an incredible legacy to a magnificent woman.I commend to my colleagues and all those interested in Patsy's remarkable life, a biography by Esther Arinaga and Rene Ojiri included in a book titled Called from Within: Early Women Lawyers of Hawaii, edited by Mari Matsuda. I wish to recap some of her brilliant life and career for the Record.Born on December 6, 1927, in Paia, Maui, Patsy was independent and ambitious from the start. As an illustration, one family story recalls that she insisted at age four on beginning school a year early. She was driven throughout her young life, and was elected student body president at Maui High School. She graduated as valedictorian in 1944, a year marked by global strife and war.Patsy's childhood curiosity about medicine led her to study zoology and chemistry at the University of Hawaii. After graduating in 1948, she applied to medical school, only to be rejected along with other bright young women aspiring to be doctors, in a time when women made up only 2 to 3 percent of an entering class. Another factor daunting her efforts was the return of our war veterans and a resulting boom in applications for graduate and postgraduate programs. Although discouraged, Patsy took wise counsel from a mentor and applied to law schools. She gained admission to the University of Chicago. It was during her years of law studies that she would meet and marry John Mink, a respected hydrologist and geologist, her loyal campaign advisor, and her lifelong companion. It was in Chicago that they would have their daughter, Wendy, a professor at Smith College.Returning to Hawaii, Patsy gained admission to the Hawaii bar in 1953, but only after a successful challenge of a statute that required a woman to take the residency status of her husband, who was a native Pennsylvanian. Such an action represented only one of several challenges to sexism that she would undertake during her professional career. In being admitted to the bar, she also logged one of many firsts by becoming the first Japanese American woman to do so in Hawaii.In the 1950s, Patsy began to take a serious interest in politics and make her mark on the Democratic Party by helping to build the party and draw many young people into its ranks. Patsy's first step into public elected office in the territorial legislature in 1956 awoke for Hawaii and the world a powerful voice that would only gain strength in its impact and not be silenced until the new millennium. From that moment forward, Patsy's professional and political record would run as if by perpetual motion.The momentous year of 1959 brought Statehood for Hawaii, and by then, Patsy had easily won election to the territorial Senate. Leading up to Statehood, while the legislature worked on landmark issues that would lend shape to Hawaii's new society, Patsy authored an ``equal pay for equal work'' law and scrutinized the Department of Education toward improving education for Hawaii's children--a cause close to my heart, as one who previously served as a teacher and principal in Hawaii's schools.In 1965, Patsy brought her views to the national stage when she became the first woman of color elected to the United States House of Representatives to represent Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District--a seat I was proud to hold for almost 14 years, before I entered the Senate. Patsy was articulate about the causes she tenaciously shepherded. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's fireside chats, heard years ago on Maui by a young Patsy, had provided her with a foundation of ideals and rhetoric from which she would draw upon for many years in her political career.During her first tenure in Congress, Patsy served her various constituencies, both in Hawaii and around this Nation, with a strong commitment to wide-ranging domestic issues, including education, the environment, child care, open Government, workers' rights, and equal opportunity. She introduced the first Early Childhood Education Act, authored the Women's Education Equity Act, supported strip mining regulation, and became an early critic of the Vietnam War. In 1971, she entered the Oregon Democratic Presidential primary. Her candidacy reflected her determined independence and frustration with Government cutbacks in social services spending and the ongoing war.In 1971, in connection with planned underground nuclear tests at Amchitka Island in the Aleutian chain, she filed suit with 32 other Members of Congress to compel disclosure of reports under the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA. She took issue with alleged Presidential authority to exempt certain information from FOIA and withhold it from judicial or legislative review. In the final outcome, in what had been described by Patsy as a sort of Waterloo of the Freedom of Information Act, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that Congress could legislate new disclosure guidelines to permit judicial review of the President's actions. In the end, the case gained tremendous historical significance when the U.S. Supreme Court cited it as precedent for the release of the Watergate tapes.In perhaps her farthest-reaching accomplishment, Patsy co-authored title IX of the Higher Education Act Amendments, which prohibits gender discrimination by educational institutions receiving Federal funds. The landmark provision was enacted in 1972 and has since, in its 30 years of existence, introduced equality in college sports and contributed greatly to the rise in women's athletics.An unsuccessful Senate bid ended her first set of years in Federal office in 1977, but it did not quiet her political involvement or public service. Indeed, in 1990 she returned to the House. In the interim, she assumed the position of Assistant Secretary of State for Ocean and International, Environmental, and Scientific Affairs, where she helped to strengthen environmental policies, particularly with regard to protection of whales, toxic chemical disposal and ocean mining. In 1980, she took the helm as the first woman president of the Americans for Democratic Action. Two years later, she returned to elected office in Hawaii by taking the gavel as chairperson of the Honolulu City Council. She twice ran unsuccessfully for other office, this time for Governor and mayor of Honolulu, then triumphed in 1990 in a special election for the remainder of my term in the other body, at the passing of our beloved colleague, Spark Matsunaga.Since 1990, she continued in characteristic style, advocating and articulating the ideals that she had espoused during her first terms in the other body. I remember Patsy marching up the Capitol steps with vigor, alongside her other female colleagues, to show her support for Anita Hill in 1991. I was pleased to work with Patsy, the distinguished senior Senator from Hawaii, Senator Dan Inouye, the honorable Secretary of Transportation, Norm Mineta, and my other colleagues in the establishment of a Congressional caucus to address the needs of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in 1994.I recall her leadership in 1996 on a successful boycott of a joint session speech by French President Jacques Chirac, in protest of French nuclear testing in the Pacific, much in line with our shared commitment to championing the disenfranchised peoples of the Pacific in our respective bodies. As we hope to complete action on a welfare reauthorization bill in this session, I remember Patsy's steadfast efforts before the passage of the 1996 welfare reform law in keeping us mindful about the possible effects of social policy changes on children. She had continued the battle cry with the current welfare reauthorization and ensured that the voices of the smallest and most vulnerable were heard.Patsy was one of the last Members of the 107th Congress who served in the historic 89th Congress that passed much of the landmark Great Society legislation. Patsy's lifelong efforts to open educational access to countless Americans and ensure them the best educational opportunities were the achievements that brought her the greatest satisfaction. ``Anything for the children,'' was Patsy's guiding conviction. I believe we shared the same view about education that this crucial area is where we can do the most good for the most people.A great spirit has come and gone before us. Patsy's vigor and courage to tackle difficult issues in the wide realm of social policy will be sorely missed. There are fewer trails for women and minorities to blaze, thanks to Patsy's determination and spirit. Indeed, her trailblazing efforts will not end with her death, for the things she put into place will continue to benefit the lives of countless individuals, in our lifetime and for generations to come, in ways that may not ever be truly appreciated.We are enjoined to carry forth the mission that my dear colleague pursued during her remarkable career. With great sadness, we bid a final farewell and aloha pumehana to a fearless and remarkable lady, the most honorable Patsy Takemoto Mink.I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today to voice my disagreement with the priorities set forth in the budget resolution we have been debating, and support for the amendments offered by my colleagues from South Carolina and New York, Senators Hollings and Schumer. With our Nation at war, we must do all we can to support our troops, ensure that our homeland is secure, and continue our emphasis on significant domestic priorities, such as education and health care. This is why I believe it would be unwise to enact further tax cuts that would pit these priorities against each other for limited Federal dollars and lead us further down the path to fiscal irresponsibility.We have commenced military operations against an enemy who has defied efforts at international diplomacy. Without a doubt, these efforts will come at substantial cost which is not reflected in this budget. Proponents must rely on budget tactics to show that we can allow additional tax cuts to be passed. I would like to associate my comments with those of my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, who rightfully attempted to enforce patriotic pause on this very point.This budget repudiates our commitment to fight the evil of terrorism within our own borders. It fails to adequately fund homeland security, which is why I am a cosponsor of the amendment offered by my friend from New York, Senator Schumer, who has requested that $88 billion be provided over 11 years for urgent homeland security needs, including immediate funding for those on the home front--first responders, firefighters, port, border and transportation security. I also applaud the provisions for bioterrorism preparedness and threat and critical infrastructure assessment. At a time when threats to U.S. civilians within our borders are very real, we must not abandon, for the sake of tax cuts, our resolve to ensure the peace of mind of families at home and individuals in their workplaces--many who are praying for loved ones fighting in our armed services abroad.This resolution calls for tax cuts that will do nothing to stimulate the economy, but would worsen the progressivity of the Tax Code. It would also rob our most important investment of required resources, and that is the investment in the education of America's children. We should be sending the message to our children that we will do all we can to give them the knowledge and tools to be able to meet future challenges that will face this country, when we in this body are long gone. Instead, if we pass additional tax cuts, we are saying that we will place political gain over a solid start in life for young Americans. This is why I voted for the amendment proposed by my colleague from Washington State, Senator Murray, along with others, that would have provided an $8.9 billion increase in education funding, as well as $8.9 billion for deficit reduction out of funding designated for tax cuts. This funding increase sought to fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act. We only began to fulfill some of the promises we made in passing this sweeping education reform law through the fiscal year 2003 appropriations process. We cannot let this investment waver in fiscal year 2004.Finally, I oppose efforts to decrease Federal revenues sorely needed to ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries have access to the comprehensive prescription drug program that they deserve. Far too many seniors are currently unable to afford the costs of the prescription drugs that their doctors prescribe. Seniors must be able to obtain meaningful prescription drug coverage through the traditional Medicare Program. I supported the amendment sponsored by my colleagues, Senators Bob Graham, Dorgan, and Stabenow, which would have made sure that a Medicare prescription drug benefit is adequately funded, by increasing the Medicare reserve fund by approximately $220 billion. The amendment would also have guaranteed that participants in traditional Medicare receive the same prescription drug benefit as beneficiaries that enroll in private Medicare health plans. The funding should be included in the budget resolution to adequately protect our Nation's seniors against the increasing costs of prescription drugs instead of to accommodate additional tax cuts. The Graham-Dorgan-Stabenow amendment would have reduced the size of the tax cuts in the budget resolution by approximately $400 billion and provided a clear choice between additional tax cuts or a meaningful prescription drug benefit.The time has come to face our fiscal responsibilities honestly. Tax cuts are not the answer at this point in our Nation's history. I join with Senator Hollings and other colleagues in opposition to the passage of additional tax cuts that would steal much needed revenues at a time of great need. I owe it to the people of Hawaii and we owe it to the people of America.",

    "title": "NOMINATION OF JUDGE SAMUEL ALITO TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito as an Associate Justice of the United States. In the months since President George W. Bush nominated Judge Samuel Alito as an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, I have carefully considered his record. I evaluated his long history of government service and his work on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and I have closely followed his confirmation hearings.When I review all the evidence before me, I do not believe Judge Alito will be able to fairly apply the principles embodied in the U.S. Constitution. Our Constitution sets forth important civil rights and privacy protections that are fundamental to our way of life today. In recent years, these freedoms have been precariously protected by a delicate balance on the Supreme Court, with Justice O'Connor frequently tipping the scales in favor of the civil rights and privacy protections that so many Americans depend upon. I am disheartened by the reality that so many of these freedoms will likely be eroded when Judge Alito joins the Court.Judge Alito's approach to the law is not merely conservative, it is extreme. Judge Alito's opinions in race and gender employment discrimination cases have crafted a restrictive interpretation of civil rights laws that would make it much more difficult for women and minorities to prevail or even receive a jury trial. I am also troubled by Judge Alito's statement in his infamous 1985 job application that he was ``particularly proud'' of his work in the Reagan administration, where he counseled the administration to restrict affirmative action and limit remedies for racial discrimination. I cherish our system of checks and balances in Government, where each branch of the Government is coequal with the other. I believe that it is critical that this balance, which our forefathers so wisely and carefully created, is protected and maintained. However, Judge Alito supports the ``unitary executive'' theory, an expansive view of Presidential powers that he and his colleagues set forth while working in the Office of Legal Counsel of the Reagan Justice Department. Since joining the Third Circuit, Judge Alito made it clear that he still holds the premise of the ``unitary executive'' theory to be true, and this approach concerns me, especially in this political climate. This approach also undermines Congress's authority to protect the public. Judge Alito has ruled that Congress did not have the authority to pass the Family Medical Leave Act or to enact a Federal ban on the possession or transfer of machine guns. In both cases, the Supreme Court disagreed with Judge Alito's conclusions and upheld these protections, demonstrating that Judge Alito's opinions are not in the mainstream.I take my responsibility to provide advice and consent seriously. I cannot support Judge Alito's nomination. Unfortunately, Judge Alito is expected to be confirmed as Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's replacement. This means he will be in the position to affect a number of critical issues in the coming years. Important questions on privacy, the environment, Presidential power, and women's reproductive rights will all come before the Court to be resolved. With Judge Alito sitting on the Supreme Court, I am very concerned about the direction the Court will take our great Nation. Although during his hearings Judge Alito promised that he would not legislate from the bench, his record indicates otherwise. For the sake of our country, I am hopeful that Judge Alito will take seriously his commitments to uphold the principles of our Constitution.",

    "text": "I join my colleagues in tribute to my dear friend and tremendous public servant, Congressman, Senator, and Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, on his recent passing. His tenure in Federal service is notable and well documented three terms in the House of Representatives and four terms in the Senate representing the people of Texas and 2 years as Secretary of the Treasury under former President Bill Clinton.I remember Lloyd as a giant in the Senate leadership when I first came to this body in 1990. He wielded the gavel at the Finance Committee and had already ascended to national recognition as a formidable Vice Presidential nominee in 1988. He was a Senator who worked hard every day to benefit the people of Texas and of this country.As a distinguished World War II veteran, Lloyd was always supportive of our veterans and fulfilling their urgent needs. He fought to preserve and protect women's rights, including the Equal Rights Amendment. He understood the needs of America's entrepreneurs and business owners and carried his acumen in economic policy from the Senate into the Clinton administration.Millie and I remember Lloyd and his wife B.A., from our years in the Senate together, with fondness. We join others in extending to his family our warmest wishes in this difficult time. We say farewell to a true statesman. This Nation is richer for his life and poorer for his loss.",

    "title": "REMEMBERING U.S. SENATOR HIRAM FONG",
    "text": "Mr. President, on August 18, 2006, I will have the honor and privilege to commemorate the 47th anniversary of the admission of Hawaii to the United States by dedicating the building housing the Kapalama Post Office in honor of the late U.S. Senator Hiram L. Fong. It is fitting that on Admissions Day, the State of Hawaii commemorates the life of one of its strongest advocates for statehood--Senator Fong--by dedicating the postal facility at 1271 North King Street in Honolulu, which stands near Senator Fong's boyhood home in Kalihi.Like so many of us with immigrant parents, Senator Fong will be remembered not only for his many accomplishments but also for his humble beginnings. As one of 11 children born to parents from China, he graduated with honors from the University of Hawaii in 1930, and continued his education at Harvard University where he received a law degree 5 years later. In 1959, when Hawaii achieved statehood, he was elected to fill one of two seats in the U.S. Senate where he served from 1959 until January 2, 1977.Senator Fong was this Nation's first U.S. Senator of Asian ancestry. He served as the ranking Republican on what was then the Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee, which is why I am so glad we are marking his life's work by dedicating this post office in his memory. I knew Hiram Fong, and I found him to be a man of great integrity. He was a compassionate advocate for civil rights and workers' rights, and throughout his 20 years of service in Congress, Senator Fong personified the spirit of bipartisan cooperation. He was instrumental in enacting landmark civil rights legislation; reforming U.S. immigration laws to end discrimination against Asian immigrants; improving job training programs for workers; and fighting for equal pay for women. The people of Hawaii were truly fortunate to have been represented by Hiram Fong.This son of Hawaii passed away on August 18, 2004, at the age of 97, followed by his wife Ellyn on March 25 of this year. Hiram and Ellyn are survived by 4 children, Hiram, Jr., Rodney, Marvin, and Mari-Ellen; 10 grandchildren; and 2 great-grandchildren. As we remember our good friend, Hiram Fong, on this Admissions Day, I ask my Senate colleagues and the people of Hawaii to pause for a moment to remember all he did on behalf of the Nation and his beloved Aloha State.Mr. President, as the former chairman of the Senate Postal Subcommittee, I was proud to introduce the legislation designating the Kapalama Post Office in memory of my friend, Senator Hiram Fong. The Senate passed my bill, S. 2089, by unanimous consent on March 3 of this year; the House of Representatives took action on March 7; and on March 20, the President signed the bill, which is now Public Law 109-203.",

    "title": "MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007",
    "text": "Mr. President, I thank my colleague very much for the opportunity to speak at this time. I rise today in support of Senator Kent Conrad's amendment. I thank Senator Conrad for his leadership and agreeing to include a provision on behalf of the senior Senator from Hawaii, Dan Inouye, and myself to H.R. 5385, the Fiscal Year 2007 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.Mr. President, I was in Hawaii on October 15, 2006, when we felt a violent tremor, an earthquake measuring 6.7 in magnitude that rocked the Hawaiian Islands, and it set off a series of aftershocks for days afterward.The earthquake loosened rocks, dirt, and building foundations, and subsequent heavy rains have continued to undermine the structural integrity of public utilities, buildings, roads, and related infrastructure. In recognition of these damages, President Bush on October 17, 2006, declared the State as a major disaster area. While this declaration enabled some relief from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, a significant amount of damage remains unaddressed.The farming community was hit particularly hard by the earthquake. The water intakes for the Lower and Upper Hamakua Ditches and the Kohala Ditch on the Big Island were buried by landslides. The earthquake and the many aftershocks also caused the collapse of earthen tunnels and wooden flumes and cracks in dams. These irrigation systems provide the sole source of water for most farmers and other members of rural communities in the region. The Big Island also suffered a collapsed lane on the Hawaii Belt Road on the Hamakua Coast, north of Hilo town.The provision would add $21 million to address the agriculture damages caused by the October 15th earthquake:$12 million to the Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS, Emergency Watershed Protection Program for the repair of the Lower Hamakua Ditch and the Waimea Irrigation System/ Upper Hamakua Ditch--which were heavily damaged by the earthquake, and are negatively impacting the farming community on the Big Island; $3 million to the Big Island Resource Conservation and Development Council to repair of the Kohala Ditch system that was also severely damaged by the earthquake; $6 million to the Farm Service Agency, FSA, for its Emergency Conservation Program to repair broken irrigation pipelines and damaged and collapsed water tanks. Of this amount, $2 million will go towards repairing the damages to stone fences on cattle ranches in the Kona and Kohala areas, and another $2 million is needed under the Emergency Loan Program to cover losses of agricultural income.Mr. President, last week I met with Big Island farmers and ranchers whose livelihoods have been dramatically impacted by the October earthquake. They need water for their farms or they risk losing cattle and crops. The damage done to Hawaii's irrigation systems is too severe to be repaired by the State alone. I promised that I would not abandon these hard-working individuals.I ask my colleagues to support Senator Conrad's amendment, which would also help Hawaii's farmers and ranchers recover from last month's earthquake.Senator Inouye and I urge our colleagues and ask them for their support. Thank you very much. I yield back the remainder of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment offered by the senior Senator from North Dakota, Kent Conrad, to H.R. 5384, the Fiscal Year 2007 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. I am proud to have joined Senator Conrad, as well as the senior Senator from Hawaii, Dan Inouye, to provide much needed relief to agricultural communities across our nation in need of assistance.This legislation is important to the agricultural industry in the State of Hawaii, in particular the County of Hawaii which was significantly impacted by the October 15, 2006, earthquake. I was in my home State during this earthquake measuring 6.7 in magnitude and present during aftershocks that were felt days after the initial tremor. A few hours after the earthquake occurred, I spoke with Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, Director David Paulison to ensure that FEMA was ready to support State and local response and recovery efforts in Hawaii. In addition, the day after the earthquake I toured the Big Island with Senator Inouye, the National Guard, and State Civil Defense to assess the resulting damage.While I am pleased that Federal, State, and local agencies have been able to work cooperatively to provide public and individual assistance, the needs of our agricultural community must not be ignored. Irrigation systems damaged by the earthquake are the sole source of water for a majority of farmers and members of rural communities in this region. In addition to the economic impact, it is imperative that we recognize that the livelihoods of these hard working individuals have drastically been impacted by the earthquake. It is for this reason I join my colleagues in supporting this amendment which would provide $3 million to the Farm Service Agency, FSA, for its Emergency Conservation Program to repair broken irrigation pipelines and damaged and collapsed water tanks. Of this amount, $2 million will go toward repairing the damages to stone fences on cattle ranches in the Kona and Kohala areas, and another $1 million is needed under the Emergency Loan Program to cover losses of agricultural income.

This amendment is necessary to ensure that they may continue to provide U.S. agricultural products, and I ask my colleagues to support this important amendment.",

    "title": "HONORING SENATORIAL SERVICE",
    "text": "Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation for all of the public service efforts of the senior Senator from Maryland, Paul Sarbanes. My friend has served in the Senate since 1977, which makes him the longest serving United States Senator from Maryland.It has been a pleasure working with Senator Sarbanes over the years on a number of issues. In 2001, I was fortunate to be added to the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. At that time, the Senator from Maryland was serving as the chairman of the committee and it was a memorable session to be a part of the committee. In the wake of the accounting failures of Enron and other public companies, Chairman Sarbanes conducted a very thorough series of hearings which led to the legislation which is now known as Sarbanes-Oxley. This is landmark legislation that has increased corporate responsibility and resulted in more effective oversight of public companies. Without the vision, courage, and ability of my friend from Maryland, that legislation would not have been possible. Despite numerous obstacles, he brought about comprehensive accounting reform.In addition, I have enjoyed working closely with the Senator from Maryland in trying to improve the financial literacy of our country. Rising health care costs and insurance premiums and the lack of affordable housing have contributed to making the lives of working families more difficult as they strain to meet their day-to-day needs. The ability of families to meet their increasing financial obligations is hampered by their significant debt burdens, particularly credit card debt, and by predatory lending practices such as refund anticipation loans. A lack of financial literacy makes it harder for families to deal with the difficult decisions they are confronted with daily. Senator Sarbanes organized the first set of hearings on the issue of financial literacy and led the creation of the Financial Literacy and Education Commission, the purpose of which is to promote financial literacy and education among all American consumers.Senator Sarbanes has been a champion for Federal employees. Throughout his Senate career, he has fought to ensure that Federal employees and members of the military receive equal pay increases. He understands that the Federal civilian workforce plays a significant role in the support of our Armed Services, and I am honored to join him annually in offering a resolution calling for pay parity between the military and Federal workers.He has been a leading advocate for consumer protection, increasing access to affordable housing, and improving public transportation in our country. I will miss having my good friend from Maryland in the Senate. He has served Maryland and the country very well. Millie and I wish him and his family the very best.",

    "title": "STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today along with my distinguished colleagues, Senator Wyden, Senator Bunning, Senator Inouye, and Senator Durbin, to introduce the Paleontological Resources Preservation Act in order to protect and preserve the Nation's important fossil record for the benefit of our citizens. Vertebrate fossils are rare and important natural resources that have become increasingly endangered due to an increase in the illegal collection of fossil specimens for commercial sale. However, at this time there is no unified policy regarding the treatment of fossils by Federal land management agencies which would help protect and conserve fossil specimens. Consequently, we risk the deterioration or loss of these valuable scientific resources. This Act will correct that omission by providing uniformity to the patchwork of statutes and regulations that currently exist. By creating a comprehensive national policy for preserving and managing paleontological resources found on Federal land, this Act will also be instrumental in curtailing and preventing future illegal trade thereby ensuring that many generations to come will have access to these invaluable records of our past. I would like to emphasize that this bill covers only paleontological remains on Federal lands and in no way affects archaeological or cultural resources under the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 or the Native American Graves Protection and Rehabilitation Act.I would also mention that this bill is exactly the same bill that I introduced in the 109th Congress. This bill was heard and marked up by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and was passed by the Senate.As a senior member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and Chair of the Subcommittee on National Parks, I am very concerned about the preservation of fossils as records of earth's past upheavals and struggles. While I recognize the value of amateur collecting--and casual collecting--of fossils is protected in this bill--fossil theft has become an increasing problem. New fossil fields and insights into the earth's past are discovered nearly every month. Paleontological resources can be sold on the market for a hefty price. For example, the complete skeleton of a T-Rex was sold for $8.6 million at auction to the Field Museum of Chicago. Consequently, they are being stolen from public lands without regard to science and education. The protections I offer in this Act are not new. Federal and management agencies have individual regulations prohibiting theft of government property. However, Congress has not provided a clear statute stating the value of paleontological resources to our Nation, as we have for archeological resources. We need to work together to make sure that we fulfill our responsibility as stewards of public lands, and as protectors of our Nation's natural resources.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,This Act may be cited as the ``Paleontological Resources Preservation Act''.As used in this Act: (1) Casual collecting.--The term ``casual collecting'' means the collecting of a reasonable amount of common invertebrate and plant paleontological resources for non- commercial personal use, either by surface collection or the use of non-powered hand tools resulting in only negligible disturbance to the Earth's surface and other resources. As used in this paragraph, the terms ``reasonable amount'', ``common invertebrate and plant paleontological resources'' and ``negligible disturbance'' shall be determined by the Secretary.

(4) Limitation.--The amount of any penalty assessed under this subsection for any one violation shall not exceed an amount equal to double the cost of response, restoration, and repair of resources and paleontological site damage plus double the scientific or fair market value of resources destroyed or not recovered. (b) Petition for Judicial Review; Collection of Unpaid Assessments.-- (1) Judicial review.--Any person against whom an order is issued assessing a penalty under subsection (a) may file a petition for judicial review of the order in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred within the 30-day period beginning on the date the order making the assessment was issued. Upon notice of such filing, the Secretary shall promptly file such a certified copy of the record on which the order was issued. The court shall hear the action on the record made before the Secretary and shall sustain the action if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. (2) Failure to pay.--If any person fails to pay a penalty under this section within 30 days-- (A) after the order making assessment has become final and the person has not filed a petition for judicial review of the order in accordance with paragraph (1); or (B) after a court in an action brought in paragraph (1) has entered a final judgment upholding the assessment of the penalty, the Secretary may request the Attorney General to institute a civil action in a district court of the United States for any district in which the person if found, resides, or transacts business, to collect the penalty (plus interest at currently prevailing rates from the date of the final order or the date of the final judgment, as the case may be). The district court shall have jurisdiction to hear and decide any such action. In such action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of such penalty shall not be subject to review.

    "text": "Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to join with my good friend, the senior Senator from Ohio, in reintroducing legislation today to establish a Deputy Secretary for Management who would be the chief management officer at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). I am especially pleased that we are joined by two of our colleagues on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Levin, who is also the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Senator McCaskill.The Department of Homeland Security continues to face serious challenges, some of which stem from integrating 22 separate entities with existing management problems into one agency. Such a broad, large-scale merger is why the Government Accountability Office (GAO) continues to place DHS on the GAO High-Risk List. Our bill would assign overall management responsibilities to one individual who would be accountable for leading and instituting change. A Deputy Secretary for Management would provide the leadership necessary to move forward and sustain these needed changes. This presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed individual, who will have a term of office of five years, would serve as a bridge between political appointees and career employees. Changing agency culture is difficult and takes time. As Comptroller General David Walker notes, successful transformation initiatives in large private and public sector organizations can take at least five to seven years.In addition to serving as chairman of Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee, I am also the chairman of the Armed Services Readiness and Management Support Subcommittee, and I have witnessed firsthand how the Department of Defense (DoD) continues to struggle with business modernization despite clear congressional directives to do so. We cannot afford to allow the Department of Homeland Security, which has an extremely complex and critical mission, to be affected by the same management problems facing DoD. Our bill is born out of our concern and frustration that DHS is not doing better. We believe elevating the Under Secretary for Management to the Deputy Secretary level will provide DHS the necessary tools needed to avoid making the same mistakes as DoD. Having a single focus for key management functions, such as human capital, financial management, information technology, acquisition management, and performance management are essential if DHS is to avoid the stovepipe style of management at DoD.A Deputy Secretary for Management would bring needed attention to management issues and transformational change; would integrate various key operational and transformation efforts; and would institutionalize accountability for addressing management issues and leading change. Our bill enhances, not diminishes, the ability of the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of DHS to focus on policy decisions while leaving the management efforts to the Deputy Secretary for Management. It is good business practice to have one individual responsible for integrating strategic plans and overseeing change.I would like to note that the Homeland Security Advisory Council, established to advise and make recommendations to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, created a Culture Task Force (CTF) at the request of Secretary Chertoff in June 2006. The CTF issued its recommendations to the Secretary last month. The January 2007 Report of the Homeland Security Culture Task Force recommends establishing an operational leadership position, ``who would report to the Secretary and be responsible for the high level Department-wide measures aimed at generating and sustaining operational integration and alignment of the component organizations.''Congress has a responsibility to ensure that agencies are instituting sound management practices that will empower agencies to spend taxpayer dollars more wisely while carrying out critical missions. A fully accountable chief management officer at DHS will make the difference by ensuring strong leadership over essential government programs.

    "title": "CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008",
    "text": "Mr. President, before I address the proposed funding for VA in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2008, I applaud Chairman Conrad and his colleagues on the Budget Committee for their hard work on this resolution. The measure before us today clearly reflects the right priorities and directions for our Nation.For a number of years, I have made the case for the President to include funds for VA health care as part of the war supplemental packages he has submitted to Congress, and every year, my colleagues and I fought to get those funds included in the budget resolution to no avail.The pending budget resolution finally recognizes that caring for returning service members and veterans is part of the cost of war and in turn proposes to fund VA health care appropriately for this effort.Right now, a great deal of attention is being paid to the needs of our men and women in uniform--attention that Chairman Conrad, myself, and other Members of this Chamber have been talking about for quite some time. I am proud to stand with Chairman Conrad in support of our service members and veterans.One of the harshest realities of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is the number of service members who have sustained complex and multiple injuries in combat.In stark contrast to past conflicts, significant improvements in battlefield medicine have enabled very seriously wounded service members to survive their injuries. Subsequently, these men and women are coming home with extraordinarily complex health care needs.We know that right now, there have been 1,882 identified and registered cases of service members who have suffered from traumatic brain injuries, or TBI, alone. This does not include those who have suffered from a milder form of this injury and may not even be aware of it. While TBI is becoming the signature wound of the current conflicts, many of these soldiers also have been rendered blind or lost a limb as a result of their injuries and the numbers of those who are coming back with serious and multiple wounds continues to grow.In recognition of the emerging medical and rehabilitative needs of veterans with traumatic brain and other injuries, Congress directed VA to establish specialized centers for rehabilitative care. VA's four lead Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers are essential to meeting the needs of the most severely injured veterans and their families.In the budget before us today, Chairman Conrad and his colleagues have provided over $300 million specifically for meeting the needs of these veterans and service members who are in need of the comprehensive health care and rehabilitative services VA delivers through their Polytrauma Centers.This level of funding will enable VA to conduct assessments and screenings of troops for traumatic brain injury, provide veterans with intensive comprehensive TBI/polytrauma rehabilitation, and most importantly, support intensive case management for veterans with TBI and other injuries when they return to their communities and continue the rehabilitation process.Recent reports by the VA inspector general and others have illustrated that case management is a key element in the process of assisting these veterans achieve the fullest possible recoveries. Funding VA so that it can provide the continuum of care needed by the most severely injured service members is imperative if we are to truly fulfill our obligation to take care of our troops and veterans.I am also very pleased that the budget resolution before us is making a long-overdue investment in mental health care.Studies published in some of the most prestigious journals have found that a third of those seeking VA care are coming for mental health concerns, including PTSD, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse. We do not know the full magnitude of this need, as many returning service members have yet to seek care from VA.As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, my goal is to make sure that VA is doing everything possible to guarantee that each and every veteran who needs mental health care--whether in North Dakota, Vermont, or Hawaii--can receive that care.I remind my colleagues that so much of the time, battle wounds manifest themselves as invisible wounds--wounds which cannot be seen but are every bit as devastating as physical wounds. PTSD affects not only a veteran's mental status, it affects his or her physical well-being as well. It impacts the veteran's relationships, his or her ability to work, and to interact in society. VA must catch readjustment issues early before they turn into full-blown PTSD, and this budget resolution would enable VA to take a serious approach towards making this happen.When we talk about the mental health needs of veterans, we cannot deny the reality that substance abuse is prevalent among many veterans. We know that many veterans with PTSD turn to drugs or alcohol in order to self-medicate. Yet the administration does not seem to want to be in the business of helping veterans with substance abuse problems. VA used to provide an intensive month-long program to treat substance abuse. Today, most VA substance abuse programs run for 2 weeks--not nearly enough time to put a veteran truly on the road to recovery. Again, this budget resolution provides funds for comprehensive inpatient substance abuse care. This is a very real investment in VA mental health care.On the benefits side, the current claims inventory and the time it takes to process a claim is unacceptable. Veterans deserve a timely and accurate response to their claims. It is obvious that Chairman Conrad agrees, as this budget resolution takes a major step toward responding to this very real problem by providing appropriate funding for VA to use to employ additional claims adjudicators.There are 30,000 more claims pending right now than last year this time. This constitutes an 8 percent increase. As the veterans population continues to age and new veterans come home from Iraq and Afghanistan, this trend of increased claims will continue. Given that it takes nearly 2 years for a new VA employee to start fully contributing to the bottom line, now is the time for new staff to be hired and trained to help reduce this caseload.Just 2 weeks ago, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs held a hearing on the VA claims adjudication process. During the hearing, VA witnesses testified to the nearly 400,000 ratings claims inventory and the 175 days it takes to process a claim for benefits. We must insist that VA have no more than 250,000 claims in the pipeline at once, and that it take not more than 125 days to adjudicate a claim. VA clearly needs additional resources to hire the employees needed to adjudicate claims in a timely manner, which this budget resolution certainly provides.Mr. President, I am very pleased with the investment in veterans programs that is made in this budget resolution. I again commend Chairman Conrad and the Budget Committee for sending the right message to our Nation's veterans--that we are honoring our commitment to them by making a real investment into their care. I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of the resolution before us today.",

I also take this opportunity to congratulate Chairman Conrad and the other conferees for their hard work on this resolution. This resolution reflects our commitment to fully fund veterans' health care and benefits.This budget resolution would provide $43.1 billion in fiscal year 2008 for the VA discretionary account--$3.6 billion more than the President requested. I am very pleased that the conference report follows the recommendations of the Democratic and Independent members of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs to provide $2.9 billion over the President's request for veterans' medical care alone. This includes an additional $303 million for treatment of traumatic brain injuries, and $693 million for VA mental health programs--two areas of vital importance to servicemembers returning from Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom.I also thank the Budget Committees for rejecting the President's proposals to impose an annual enrollment fee for VA health care and to increase the prescription drug copayment. These proposals would have unduly burdened thousands of veterans who cannot afford higher costs for the health care they have earned and deserve.I again commend Chairman Conrad and the other conferees for their work on the budget resolution, and for sending the right message to our Nation's veterans. We have made a commitment to their care, and this resolution honors that commitment. I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of the resolution before us today.",

    "title": "DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COLLEGE ACCESS ACT OF 1999",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 1124 and the opportunity it provides for DC's college-bound students. The reauthorization of the District of Columbia College Access Act of 1999 would continue a successful and effective scholarship program.The DC tuition assistance grant program, or DCTAG, provides scholarships to cover the difference between in-State and out-of-State tuition for eligible DC residents attending any public college or university in the country. DCTAG awards those recipients up to $10,000 annually and $50,000 total in tuition assistance.The original purpose of the bill was to address concern that college-bound students in the District were at a disadvantage because DC lacks a State university system. DCTAG expanded higher education opportunities by allowing students to attend public universities and colleges nationwide at in-State tuition rates.The original bill also allows students to attend a limited number of nonprofit private schools to receive scholarships of up to $2500 annually and $12,500 total. Students who attend any historically black college or university or any private school in the District, Maryland, or Virginia qualify for private school grants. The 2002 reauthorization clarified that the grants were only for U.S. citizens residing in DC.The success of the program is clear. Since the launch of DCTAG in 2000, participation among DC residents more than doubled from 1,900 recipients to 4,700 recipients. DCTAG has awarded 26,000 grants totaling over $141 million to 9,769 District students. I am pleased to say that a few of those grants went to students attending the University of Hawaii at Manoa in my home State.Not only are more students receiving grants; more are going to college. The college enrollment rate for DC public school students has doubled to 60 percent and 38 percent of students in the program are the first ones in their family to attend college. DCTAG affords many District residents a chance to go to college when they otherwise would not be able to afford it.In July, my Subcommittee on the District of Columbia held a hearing with the Mayor and his education leadership team on their reform proposal for the public school system. They offered a realistic picture of DC public schools and a realistic vision for accountability and reform.The Chancellor of Education, Michelle Rhee, and the Mayor are working very hard to improve the unacceptably low performance of DC students by recruiting talented teachers, reforming the administrative offices, and repairing crumbling schools. They deserve all the support that the Congress can provide in their efforts. As the cost of college tuition continues to rise at both public and private institutions, this scholarship program offers the District's students hope that if they perform well in high school they can have the same opportunity to access affordable, public, higher education as students in Virginia, in Maryland, and across the country.Students who know they have the opportunity to go to college are more likely to perform well in high school. The DCTAG program supports the Mayor's efforts to improve DC public schools by offering students the chance to go to college at a minimal cost to the Federal Government.The DCTAG bill was reported out of committee in February, and now is the time to finally get it passed. I understand my colleague and fellow committee member, Senator Coburn, has asked that two amendments to the legislation be considered.The first amendment would modify the eligibility standard for the scholarship recipients to exclude any student whose family earns an income of $1 million or more. Despite the high income threshold, I am concerned about starting down the road of making this a needs-based scholarship program. The program is designed to provide all DC residents access to a range of higher education institutions. I have agreed to accept this amendment despite my misgivings for the sake of the entire program's reauthorization.The second amendment, however, I am not prepared to accept. It would threaten the integrity and success of the program by increasing the grant amounts for private schools. Nearly 10 times the number of students in the program attend public schools versus private schools, and an increase in the grant amounts for private schools would reduce the overall available funding. Fewer students would be able to participate in the program, and lower income students trying to attend more affordable public schools, in particular, would be significantly burdened, in some cases, potentially, being forced to forego college altogether.For many students, the importance of this program in defraying out-of-State tuition costs means the difference between attending college or not. I cannot support this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment as well.DCTAG has helped thousands of DC students who receive postsecondary education. Its credibility and its effectiveness is evident.I urge my colleagues to support the bill and oppose Senator Coburn's second amendment.I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to commend Budget Committee chairman Kent Conrad for his fine work on this budget resolution. It will lower our taxes and create hundreds of thousands of new jobs for Americans. In addition, I am very pleased this budget resolution honors our Nation's veterans by providing the necessary funds for our wounded warriors. Funding for our veterans is very important, and I wish to speak about this again at a later time.The resolution passed by the Budget Committee last Thursday will balance our Federal budget by 2012 and fund programs that are critical to the health and safety of Americans. It provides tax relief to middle-income Americans, honors our fighting men and women in the Armed Forces, shows respect for our wounded and disabled veterans, and ensures the continued safety and security of our Nation.By focusing on the real needs of Americans and reviving our slowing economy, the budget resolution seeks to restore balance--balance to our finances and balance to our priorities for America. The budget resolution increases funding for veterans health care and children's health care. It provides a substantial increase above the President's budget for education and Head Start. It promotes greater efficiency and renewable energy programs. It extends middle-class tax cuts, such as marriage penalty relief and the child tax credit, and it brings more middle-class Americans into a 10-percent tax bracket. The budget resolution also invests in building and repairing roads, bridges, harbors, airports, and schools because we recognize our economic success depends on public infrastructure investment.As Chairman Conrad has noted, this budget is only a first step, but it is an important step to reach our goal of long-term fiscal security. I am prepared to join Chairman Conrad in this important mission to balance our budget, restore our military readiness, honor our commitment to troops and veterans, and enhance our national security.I urge my colleagues to do the same. It is time that we provide a real future for our children and our country.I yield the floor.",

    "text": "Madam President, I am pleased to discuss funding for VA in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2009. Chairman Conrad and his colleagues on the Budget Committee have done impressive work on this resolution.They have demonstrated sound judgment in their funding recommendation to address the needs of our country.Service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, like those who returned from Vietnam, Korea, World War II and all previous wars, bear the effects of their service.They show us that the costs of war do not end on the battlefield. In crafting this budget, we are in a position to ensure that care for returning service members, of every war, is a top priority.The Department of Veterans Affairs provides superior health care to millions of veterans every year.It is widely regarded as one of the top health care systems in America. Today, VA faces a growing wave of new demands--veterans of past wars are aging and making greater use of the system, and younger veterans of the current conflicts require a new range of services from Congress must provide the resources for VA to meet all of these demands.This budget resolution acknowledges the challenges facing VA. It meets our responsibility of caring for our Nation's service members and veterans. In recent years, VA and Congress have made a tremendous investment in mental health services. I am pleased that this budget reflects an ongoing commitment to better serve the needs of veterans with mental health concerns.Madam President, I remind my colleagues that battle wounds frequently manifest themselves as invisible wounds. These wounds can be just as devastating as physical wounds. Indeed, many mental health disorders, including substance use disorder and PTSD, have both physical and mental manifestations.They impact the veteran's relationships and his or her ability to work and to interact in society. The effects of many mental health disorders can be limited or even avoided if they are caught and treated promptly, before long-term disabilities develop.This budget resolution provides the funds to continue the essential task of providing timely access to mental health care for all veterans.Families play a critical role in the well-being of veterans. As chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I held a hearing yesterday on the role of families in veterans' lives, and on the support VA and DoD provides them.Families are often the primary caregivers for injured veterans, and provide essential assistance in recovery and rehabilitation through reintegration into civilian life. The degree of support provided by family members is directly related to a veteran's ability to deal effectively with readjustment and mental health concerns.Providing support to veterans' families is in VA's vital interest.One of the harshest realities of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is the number of soldiers who have sustained complex and multiple injuries in combat.Significant improvements in battlefield medicine have enabled many seriously wounded servicemembers to survive their injuries. These men and women are coming home with extraordinarily complex health care needs.VA and Congress have focused on addressing the needs of these veterans. There have been improvements in screening and care for service members with traumatic brain injury, but much remains to be done.In addition, Congress directed VA to establish specialized centers for rehabilitative care in response to the challenging medical and rehabilitative needs of veterans with multiple and complex injuries.VA's four lead polytrauma rehabilitation centers are essential to meeting the needs of the most severely injured veterans and their families.As we work to meet the needs of all returning servicemembers, we must pay close attention to the full range of war wounds--from eye trauma and damage to servicemembers' hearing, to PTSD and depression, to burn injuries.Another important tool which VA is still developing is comprehensive health screening for returning servicemembers. This is absolutely essential. Without effective screening for mental health disorders, traumatic brain injury, hearing and vision loss and other injuries or disorders, VA will miss opportunities to help veterans in need of services.Further, I believe comprehensive health screening before deployment is essential to help with the evaluation and understanding of the effects of combat on servicemembers. As chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have worked to ensure that all veterans receive appropriate health screenings. I will continue to advocate for these screenings.On the benefits side of the ledger, in the last year, Congress has provided a significant amount of funding to VA for much-needed staffing to adjudicate claims. Our Nation's veterans deserve nothing less than having their claims rated accurately and in a reasonable period of time. Now, the American people, especially veterans, will expect to see a decreasing backlog and increased timeliness and quality.I pledge my continuing support to get veterans the benefits they need in an appropriate amount of time. Congress must now assure that VA has sufficient funding for technology and training initiatives to aid in its endeavor to reduce the backlog of claims. This budget resolution is certainly a step in the right direction.The entitlement funding provided to veterans in this budget resolution reflects the Nation's continuing responsibility to care for he who has borne the battle, long after the last shots of war have been fired. Indeed, I view funding for veterans' entitlements as a continuing cost of war.The administration's VA budget request proposed severe cuts to many essential programs and accounts. Research, the inspector general, the National Cemetery Administration, and grants for State home construction would all be unnecessarily cut.I am particularly troubled by the proposed cuts of nearly 50 percent to the VA construction accounts. Over the past year, internal reviews identified widespread maintenance concerns, in addition to already planned construction projects. I find it unconscionable that in the face of the pressing demands across the country, the President would suggest such cuts. The budget proposal advanced by Chairman Conrad and his colleagues rectifies these mistakes in the President's request, and I appreciate their foresight on these issues.I am pleased with the investment in veterans programs that is made in this budget resolution. I again commend Chairman Conrad and the Budget Committee for their thoughtful and responsible work. Care for our Nation's veterans is truly a cost of war, and it is our responsibility to meet their needs.I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of the resolution before us.I thank you, Madam President.",

    "title": "LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT OF 2007--MOTION TO PROCEED--Resumed",
    "text": "Mr. President, yesterday was Equal Pay Day in America. It is befitting that it was on a Tuesday because Tuesday is the day on which women's wages catch up to men's wages from the previous week. It is most unfortunate that women continue to be discriminated against by employers, in particular those who routinely pay lower wages for jobs that are dominated by women.However, today my colleagues in the Senate will have an opportunity to begin the process to restore the intent of Congress as it relates to the fundamental fairness to millions of workers. We will have a chance to override a decision by the Supreme Court last June, in the case of Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. In this case, the Court, in a 5-to-4 ruling, reversed a longstanding interpretation, used by nine Federal circuits and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, EEOC, under which the statute of limitations for pay discrimination begins to run each time an employee receives a paycheck or other form of compensation. Instead, the Court ruled that the 180-day statute of limitations on filing a discrimination claim with the EEOC begins to run when the original discriminatory decision is made and conveyed to the employee, regardless of whether the pay discrimination continues beyond the 180-day period. This is an unfair and unjust ruling. For employees who are prohibited from having access to data reflecting the wages of other employees, it is impossible for them to ascertain whether they have been a victim of wage discrimination--let alone, to know from the original time of the discriminatory act. In many cases, employees may not know until years later that they have been discriminated against on the basis of pay.I urge my colleagues to support cloture on the motion to proceed to this important legislation, and to support enactment of this bill. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007 will restore the interpretation that the statute of limitations begins to run each time an employee receives a paycheck or other form of compensation reflecting the discrimination, otherwise known as the ``paycheck accrual'' rule. It would ensure that employees who can prove pay discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability will not be forever barred from seeking redress because they did not learn that they were victims of pay discrimination within 6 months after the discrimination first occurred.Although women still only earn 77 cents for every $1 earned by men, we should not be moving backwards. It is simple, this legislation will restore an employee's right to seek restitution against wage discrimination at the time the employee discovers it. In addition, it is important to note that this legislation is not just about gender pay discrimination. In 2007, EEOC received more than 7,000 pay discrimination charges. While some are on the basis of gender, others are on the basis of race, disability, national origin, and age.Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to do what is right and support cloture and passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.

Title I entails adjustments to education benefits currently offered by VA. Title II addresses disability claims adjudication, memorials affairs, insurance and specially adapted housing. Title III addresses health care matters, including nursing home care, contract-care payment, personnel pay and disclosure of private information and medical records. Title IV addresses VA police officers and VA medical facility leases.Title I of the bill would make several administrative and housekeeping changes to VA's education programs, allowing for faster and more efficient claims adjudication. Among other changes, this title would eliminate the requirement that a student file an application with VA upon changing his or her program of study while remaining enrolled at the same school and eliminate the requirement that wages must be earned in order to participate in VA's full-time on-job training, OJT, program.Title II would make changes to disability claims adjudication, memorial affairs, insurance and specially adapted housing. Specifically, it would explicitly authorize VA to stay temporarily its adjudication of a pending claim before a VA regional office or the Board of Veterans' Appeals, when a Federal Circuit appeal on the relevant issue is pending. It would also authorize the Board to decide cases out of docket-number order when a case has been stayed or when there is sufficient evidence to decide a claim, but a claim with an earlier docket number is not ready for decision. This title of the bill would also extend full-time and family SGLI coverage to Individual Ready Reservists.Title III pertains to health care matters, including nursing home care, contract-care payment, personnel pay and disclosure of private information and medical records. It would make permanent VA's authority to provide non-institutional extended care services either directly, by contract, or by another provider or payor. It would also extend VA's obligation to provide nursing home care to veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 70 percent or greater until December 31, 2013, and VA's authority to establish non-profit research corporations through the same date. This title would also repeal requirements that VA produce certain reports and make permanent VA's authority to assign enrollment priority category 6 to those veterans who participated in chemical and biological warfare testing at DOD's Deseret Test Center from 1962 to 1973.The fourth and final title of this bill would permit VA police officers to carry firearms and conduct investigations of crimes that occurred on VA property, while off VA property in an official capacity. It also would increase the uniform allowance of VA police officers, to ensure they do not have to pay out-of-pocket for uniform maintenance. Finally, it would raise the threshold for congressional authorization for major medical facility leases from $600,000 to $1,000,000.I am introducing this bill for the review and consideration of my colleagues at the request of the Administration. As Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have not taken a position on this legislation.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a letter of support be printed in the Record.",

    "title": "DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2009",
    "text": "Mr. President, as chairman of the District of Columbia subcommittee, I rise today in support of S. 160, the District of Columbia Voting Rights Act of 2009. I vote to enfranchise thousands of District residents and to affirm my commitment to the fundamental right of all Americans to participate in our great democracy.Despite our Nation's founding principle of ``no taxation without representation,'' District of Columbia residents lack full representation in Congress. They have sent sons and daughters to war in defense of our country, and they have paid Federal taxes in support of our Government. Despite this, the distinguished Delegate from the District of Columbia lacks a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives.Fair voting representation is fundamental to our democracy. I understand the challenges facing the District's residents, and I sympathize with its trouble to attain voting representation in Congress. I also understand that this will be an ongoing discussion. I am sensitive to the concerns raised by my colleagues on the constitutionality of our actions.Legal scholars have testified before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee that Congress does have the constitutional authority to extend a vote to a District Representative in the House. I believe this legislation is constitutional, but ultimately it is the role of the courts to decide.Our representative democracy is based on the principle that citizens of this country should have a say in the laws that govern this country. If citizens disagree with the laws, they have the power to vote for different representatives. By extending this core principle to the District of Columbia, I believe this bill would be a decisive step forward for the rights of DC residents.Now I wish to address the pending Ensign amendment.Today, we are addressing voting rights. Now is not an appropriate time to cloud the debate with amendments on gun control. Last year, when this gun issue was brought up on the Senate floor before being considered by the committee, I joined 10 of my colleagues in a letter to the majority leader asking that the bill follow Senate procedures and be referred to committee before consideration on the floor.As the chairman of the subcommittee charged with the oversight of the District of Columbia, I am familiar with the debate on DC's gun policies. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court in the Heller decision struck down the District of Columbia's gun ban. Since then, the DC City Council has taken necessary steps to comply with the Supreme Court's decision, including the passage of legislation to address issues raised by the ruling. I do not believe any congressional action is needed to help DC comply with the Heller decision, but, more importantly, this is not the appropriate time to consider and vote on this issue.I am not against gun ownership. I am for self-determination. I strongly encourage my colleagues to give the District of Columbia and its citizens the opportunity to vote on and establish their own rules regarding gun control. It would be ironic if we were to with one hand finally give the people of the District voting representation but on the other hand take away their right to self-determination by forcing them to adopt a gun control policy on which they were unable to vote. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to vote no on the Ensign amendment and all related amendments.I am proud to lend my support for the underlying bill. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of voting rights for the residents of the District of Columbia and to reject any amendment that would abridge those rights or is not germane to the issue at hand.Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "title": "REMEMBERING SENATOR EDWARD M. KENNEDY",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend from Massachusetts, Senator Edward Moore Kennedy, who improved the lives of so many people during his 46 years of service in the Senate. My warm aloha and prayers continue to be with Vicki Kennedy, staff members, the Kennedy family, and his many friends.Senator Kennedy's extraordinary life-long commitment to public service produced a proud legacy that has included expanding access to quality of health care and education, protecting and empowering our Nation's workforce, ensuring civil and voting rights, and protecting our Nation's natural and cultural resources.Before outlining several of Senator Kennedy's important achievements, I want to share a story that demonstrates our shared commitment to helping working families and his optimistic outlook about the future despite temporary disappointments. A beaming Senator Kennedy flagged me down on the morning of March 2, 2005. He asked me if I had seen the Washington Post. In an editorial criticizing the bankruptcy overhaul under consideration in the Senate, the Post indicated the bill could be made more fair by the inclusion of several amendments by Senator Kennedy intended to protect consumers and my amendment to better inform consumers about the true costs associated with credit card use. After my amendment was defeated, Senator Kennedy was the first member to approach me. He complimented me for my work and told me that we would win on the amendment one day. Senator Kennedy was right. It took me another four years, but my credit card minimum payment warning and credit counseling referral legislation was enacted this May as part of the credit card reform law.As an eternal optimist, Senator Kennedy never stopped advocating for the causes so important to working families such as increasing access to quality health care. Senator Kennedy helped establish community health centers, the Children's Health Insurance program, and programs that assist individuals suffering from HIV/AIDS. These are just a few of the many health accomplishments that Senator Kennedy helped bring about that improve the quality of life for millions of people in our country. Despite continuing to battle cancer, Senator Kennedy's passion to expand access to quality health care never ceased.Senator Kennedy had an enormous impact on education policy. He championed early childhood education through his support of Head Start and creation of Early Head Start. His work in reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act included improvements such as the Star Schools Program Assistance Act, which improves instruction in critical areas such as mathematics, science, and foreign languages, as well as the No Child Left Behind Act, which requires standards-based assessments for elementary and middle school students among other reforms. With regard to higher education, Senator Kennedy supported the creation of the Pell Grant program, Direct Lending program, and Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act to aid Americans in paying for college. Throughout his efforts in education policy, he recognized the needs of underserved populations, and endeavored to make education more affordable. I also appreciated his working with me on the Excellence in Economics Education authorization and subsequent funding requests so that more children could be better prepared for the financial decisions they will have to make as consumers, investors, and heads of households.I also greatly appreciate all of the work done by Senator Kennedy to improve the lives of members of our Nation's workforce. Senator Kennedy helped increase the Federal minimum wage 16 times. He fought for strong workplace health and safety standards, promoted equal pay for equal work, and secure retirement benefits. Senator Kennedy believed the right of workers to unionize and bargain collectively was fundamental and was always a tireless advocate for this cause. In addition, Senator Kennedy was a champion of our Federal workers and opposed efforts to outsource Federal jobs and erode workers' rights. I recall his staunch opposition to weaken the a rights of Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security employees and his strong statements in support of granting Transportation Security Administration Security officers real rights and protections.Senator Kennedy's career-long dedication to ensuring civil and voting rights helped bring about numerous changes that have made our country stronger, more equitable, and just. He condemned the poll tax, led efforts to lower the voting age to 18, and removed voting barriers. His fierce and noble opposition to discrimination by race, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, or religion guided much of his work.Senator Kennedy's advocacy for natural and cultural resources helped advance the protection of our environment for our benefit now and into the future. He was an important supporter of energy efficiency programs, including those that aid Americans most in need, and he helped improve fuel economy standards and energy research and development. His work led to the enhanced preservation of numerous treasured resources in Massachusetts including the Minute Man National Historic Park, the Taunton River, the New England Scenic Trail, the Freedom's Way National Heritage Corridor, the Boston Harbor Islands, the Quinebaug-Shetucket National Heritage Corridor, Essex National Heritage Area, and the Lowell National Historical Park.In addition to his accomplishments and advocacy on behalf of the people of our country, I will remember Ted Kennedy as a true friend, always generous with his assistance and time. For many years, my desk was next to Senator Kennedy's. He welcomed me to the Senate and always provided sound advice and guidance.In 1990, despite the long journey, Senator Kennedy came to Hawaii to help me during my first Senate campaign. I remember the rally that we held in Honolulu at McKinley High School as being one of the largest ever held in Hawaii. We also had a memorable visit to an early childhood development program. Footage of the event was recently replayed on the news in Hawaii, showing Senator Kennedy and me singing Itsy, Bitsy, Spider with the children.We toured Kapiolani Children's Hospital where we saw the devastating effect that crystal meth was having on families.Senator Kennedy visited the University of Hawaii's John F. Kennedy Theatre, where he received an award for his work on health care. He spoke eloquently about our Great Country, Congressional debates, civil rights, and economic empowerment programs.I, along with every Member of this body, will very much miss our friend from Massachusetts. Senator Kennedy's extraordinary work has improved the quality of life for so many people.We can honor his memory by continuing to work to address the issues Senator Kennedy was so passionate about such as meaningful health care and immigration reform.I say aloha to my good friend and colleague, Senator Kennedy.Mr. President, I yield the floor.",

    "title": "COPS HIRING PROGRAM FUNDING",
    "text": "Mr. President, I support the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2010. This bill's priorities will protect America from terrorism and violent crime; create jobs for Americans by investing in the Nation's scientific infrastructure and in new technologies; and ensure a timely and accurate 2010 decennial census.In Hawaii, as in the rest of the Nation, sexual and domestic violence unfortunately persists, bringing with it the need for programs and services that address such violence and meet the needs of victims. For nearly four decades, the Sexual Assault Response Services of the Hawaii County and Kauai County YWCAs, have offered a 24/7 sexual assault hotline, 24/7 on-call crisis intervention, and support for victims of sexual assault and violence through the medical examination and legal services process, individual/group therapeutic counseling, and case management. I am therefore thankful that this bill includes $400,000 to enable the Hawaii and Kauai County YWCAs to continue their critically needed services.Like other political jurisdictions across the Nation, Hawaii has pursued collaborative, community based delinquency prevention programs targeted to at-risk youth. To address this need the bill includes $300,000 for Ka Wili Pu (Native Hawaiian for ``the blend'') a project that would provide 400 at-risk youth on Maui with adult guidance and adult role models and one-on-one instruction to bolster their self-esteem, self-confidence, school attendance, and academic performance and dissuade them from becoming truants and dropouts. By encouraging at-risk youth to remain in school, fulfill their promise, and avoid a problematic future with few meaningful options, Ka Wili Pu promotes a healthier and more stable society.Recognizing that children and elderly adults can become lost and disoriented in the urban and suburban areas of Hawaii, $500,000 is provided for A Child Is Missing--ACIM--Hawaii. ACIM currently operates in 49 States but not in Hawaii, where its advanced telephone-based computer system only recently became available. That system can place 1,000 phone calls every 60 seconds to residences and businesses in the area where a missing child or adult was last seen. This initiative will provide that critical rapid response to assist law enforcement agencies in Hawaii to locate missing children and adults.I am also pleased that $500,000 was included in this legislation for the State Courts Improvement Initiative of the National Center or to Courts, NCSC. The NCSC was founded in 1971 by the Conference of Chief Justices, CCJ, the Conference of State Court Administrators, COSCA, and former U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. Today, the NCSC serves as a think tank, forum, and voice for 30,000 judges, and 20,000 courthouses, in the State court system in the 50 States, DC, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, where annually 98 percent of court filings are submitted. This request funds the implementation of the NCSC's State Courts Improvement Initiative, which will increase support services to judges, administrators and other personnel in the state court system. Improving the operations of the state courts will help shape Americans' understanding of and confidence in the Nation's judicial system.Because there may be Hawaii prisoners with credible claims to actual innocence who have exhausted their appellate rights and their rights to counsel, the bill includes $300,000 for the Hawaii Innocence Project. Founded in 2005 by Hawaii attorneys in partnership with the William S. Richardson School of Law, this project, in which law students work alongside practicing criminal defense attorneys, provides pro bono assistance to Hawaii prisoners who no longer have access to legal resources but who may be innocent of the crimes for which they were convicted, and whose innocence may now be proven through technology unavailable at the time of their trials. The possible exoneration of any wrongfully convicted individual will help to serve the cause of justice.The Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, acknowledges that immigrant women, particularly indigent women, are a specific and often overlooked at-risk group. In Hawaii, the Hawaii Immigrant Justice Center, HIJC, is the only agency providing pro bono civil legal services to indigent immigrants, particularly immigrant women who are victims of sexual assault and domestic violence. For many years, the HIJC has coordinated and delivered comprehensive assistance to indigent immigrant women through a cost-effective delivery of legal, medical, psychological, and social services that would otherwise have required the intervention of a range of other public agencies and at far greater cost. I am pleased that this bill includes $200,000 for the HIJC to enable the agency to continue to perform its good work, which not only assists immigrant victims of sexual violence but places them on a path to self-sufficiency that will, in time and over the long term, mitigate the effects of crime and promote family and social stability.All in all, the fiscal year 2010 Department of Justice-related appropriations will help Hawaii to discourage delinquency and crime, bring criminals to justice, address and meet the needs of victims, and promote a fairer and more just society.Funding included in this bill also bolsters advancements in science and technology, as well as enhances U.S. competitiveness. I am proud to have worked with Senator Inouye to secure resources that support ecosystem based management, preserve the endangered Hawaiian Monk Seal, strengthen our understanding of climate change, improve warning systems for public safety, and further science education at the 'Imiloa Astronomy Center. These programs will inform our decisions on how we manage our resources, as well as understand and interact with our natural environment.Maintaining healthy ecosystems that extend into our oceans is important. Coral reef ecosystems provide benefits by protecting coastal communities, sustaining fisheries, and preserving biodiversity. Hawaii's coral reefs generate more than $360 million a year on reef related tourism and fisheries activities. To ensure this natural resource is preserved, $2.250 million is provided in this bill to conduct studies that will enable scientists to develop predictive management tools for the conservation and management of healthy coral reef ecosystems in Hawaii and develop best practices to restore reefs where human related activities result in reef ecosystem decline. This initiative will help ensure that these reefs are protected and managed well, while also empowering coastal communities across the country to minimize human impact on our reefs.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will receive $4 million in this bill to continue the implementation of the Hawaiian monk seal recovery plan. The Hawaiian monk seal, endemic to Hawaii, is the most endangered seal in the country and one of the most endangered marine mammals in the world. In the last 50 years the Hawaiian monk seal population has fallen by 60 percent, with a current population of less than 1,200 individual seals. Funding will address female and juvenile monk seal survival and enhancement, as well as efforts to minimize monk seal mortality. Further, these funds will strengthen coordinated regional office efforts for field response teams and enhance implementation of the 2007 recovery plan.We know that there are significant effects of climate change, especially in Hawaii and the Pacific region. As island communities, sea level rise, coral bleaching, and severe weather associated with climate change have unique impacts on the public safety, economic development, and health of our ecosystems and wildlife. Fortunately, $1.5 million is provided in the bill for the International Pacific Research Center at the University of Hawaii to conduct systematic and reliable climatographic research for the Pacific. Improving our understanding of climate variability empowers us to use data and models to mitigate adverse impacts.Given Hawaii's geographic isolation, having warning systems in place to address public safety needs is critical. In order to focus on response and preparedness needs, I worked to ensure that $2 million was provided to foster the development of infrasound as a warning tool for natural hazards. As a joint initiative by the University of Hawaii and University of Mississippi, infrasound technology has the potential to minimize the catastrophic human and economic loss resulting from a natural disaster. The objective is to develop technologies for infrasound warning systems for emergency organizations and traffic control agencies. Potential applications of infrasound monitoring may include volcanic eruptions, gulf coast hurricane tracking, tsunami infrasound warning, acoustic monitoring of ocean swells, infrasonic tornado detection, and other natural disasters such as avalanches and wild fires. Development of this technology and lessons learned can help enhance existing warning systems nationwide.Developing interest in science by our Nation's youth at an early age ensures that they are better prepared to pursue and excel in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math. In an effort to cultivate a life-long interest in science and learning, $2.5 million is provided to expand astronomy and culture exhibits, as well as to develop community and educational programming at the Imiloa Astronomy Center. This endeavor is a joint initiative supported by partners including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. This program will serve as a model that integrates university/research institution resources with community learning needs using the center as a catalyst to engage and educate students and the general community. Further, this initiative increases public understanding and enjoyment of science research, while supporting the national priority of attracting more students into science and technology related fields.In conclusion, I would like to thank the senior Senator from Hawaii and the senior Senator from Mississippi, the chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the Appropriations Committee, as well as the senior Senator from Maryland and the senior Senator from Alabama, the Chairwoman and ranking member, respectively, for the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, for their support in funding these important priorities for Hawaii and for their efforts in developing and managing this bill through the legislative process.",

    "title": "OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS",
    "text": "Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for the Omnibus appropriations act for fiscal year 2010, H.R. 3288. This bill combines six appropriations bills that provide funding for essential programs related to improving education, housing, and transportation; increasing research opportunities; providing justice; strengthening our foreign operations; constructing needed military facilities; and caring for our Nation's veterans. I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senators Inouye and Cochran, as well as the various subcommittee chairmen and ranking members, for their efforts to bring this important bill to the floor.I am pleased that included in this bill is funding for a number of K-12 and postsecondary educational initiatives, as well as cultural and financial literacy efforts. These programs will benefit Hawaii and the Nation and are especially critical now when States are facing increased financial pressure. These investments in education will aid individuals and society as a whole by helping to better prepare our keiki, our children, for tomorrow's challenges.For elementary and secondary education, resources in the act support such areas as history, science, literacy, and college prep. I supported additional resources for National History Day, a program that encourages more than half a million students each year to research, synthesize, and interpret primary and secondary sources in order to create an original work for the programs' annual contest. As science, technology, engineering, and math, STEM, are four subjects whose study is critical to national goals, the Maui Economic Development Board and Kauai Economic Development Board will work to advance STEM education and careers for students from underrepresented groups on Maui and Kauai using appropriations in this act. I also joined a number of my colleagues in working to fund Reach Out and Read, a nonprofit organization that makes use of pediatric doctor's visits as a teachable moment on the importance of parents reading to their children. Additionally, the Consolidated Appropriations Act will assist programs that prepare high school students for college at Hawaii Community College, Leeward Community College, and the Pacific Islands Center for Educational Development.Included among the postsecondary initiatives in the bill are two programs at the Richardson School of Law at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, one of which comprehensively works to address issues relating to Native Hawaiians and the law and a second that will create a center on health policy. The bill will also allow the University of Hawaii at Hilo to expand programs at the Imiloa Astronomy Education Center and to establish a clinical training and applied science programs at the state's only pharmacy school.I believe that historic preservation is necessary to ensure that future generations benefit from an understanding of their heritage and that cultural programs are integral to a broad-based education in a multicultural nation and interconnected world. Therefore, I am pleased that the Henry Giugni Kupuna Memorial Archives at the University of Hawaii, Bishop Museum, and Polynesian Voyaging Society will receive funding.In addition, this bill includes vital financial education resources. My Excellence in Economic Education, EEE, Act program will receive $1.447 million for fiscal year 2010. The Triple-E funds a range of activities such as teacher training, research and evaluation, and school-based activities to further economic principles and ensure that our students are more financially literate. Financial literacy in schools is essential to ensure that students are able to be prepared to effectively participate in the modern complex economy. Moreover, I was pleased to continue my efforts in championing financial literacy efforts by backing provisions for the Council for Economic Education and Center for Civic Education.Additionally, the Department of Treasury's Office of Financial Education will have an increase of $1 million to further their efforts, revise the national strategy on financial literacy, and develop measurable goals and objectives for the Financial Literacy and Education Commission.One of the fundamental causes of the financial crisis was that people were steered into mortgages with risks and costs they could not afford or even understand. The Financial Education and Pre-Home Counseling Pilot Program was authorized pursuant to section 1132 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, Public Law 110-289. I am proud that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and I were able to secure $3.15 million for a demonstration program in Hawaii. This program will strengthen the CDFI Fund's support for a range of financial education and counseling services to prospective homebuyers and address critical financial literacy needs of families.This is a competitive grant that will be awarded by the Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. Grants awarded through the Pilot Program will have the ultimate goal of identifying successful methods of financial education and counseling services that result in positive behavioral change for financial empowerment and establishing program models for organizations to deliver effective financial education and counseling services to prospective homebuyers.The National Low Income Housing Coalition's Out of Reach report ranked Hawaii as the most expensive State for housing. As credit has become harder to obtain and downpayment requirements for home purchases have significantly increased, working families in Hawaii need assistance to better prepare for purchasing a home. These services can include credit counseling, assisting with savings planning, and educating potential home buyers about mortgage products and available programs intended to support home ownership. Pre-home ownership counseling helps prepare prospective homeowners to be better able to purchase a home and select an appropriate mortgage product and increases the likelihood that families will be able to remain in their homes. This project will focus on providing assistance to low-and moderate-income prospective home buyers in under served communities. The Government Accountability Office is required to study the impact and effectiveness of the demonstration grants authorized by section Additionally, the legislation provides necessary resources for housing and transportation. Thirteen million dollars is provided for the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant, which is administered in the State of Hawaii by the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, DHHL. These resources are extremely important to support additional home ownership opportunities for residents throughout Hawaii. DHHL is the largest housing developer in the State of Hawaii.In addition to having high housing costs, Honolulu has among the Nation's worst driving travel times. That is why I am pleased that this bill contains Federal dollars to supplement the substantial local investment in the Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project. Furthermore, I am glad that the Neighbor Islands will receive needed resources for their rural bus service. These projects will help to reduce our reliance on imported fuels that pollute our islands, promote economic development and provide additional transportation options for our State's families.A number of programs through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Consolidated Appropriations Act will also assist my State. Funding for Hawaiian monk seal recovery plan implementation furthers work to protect the less than 1,200 monk seals living today, while funds for coral reef maintenance are important to coastal communities in terms of supporting tourism, fisheries, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and shoreline protection. The bill's funding of $2 million facilitates a University of Hawaii, University of Mississippi, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and University of California San Diego consortium dedicated to employing infrasound, or low-frequency sound, as a warning tool for natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions and tsunamis, having the potential for catastrophic human and economic impacts to taxpayers. Efforts at the International Pacific Research Center, IPRC, within the University of Hawaii School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology are also supported by $1.5 million in funding. The IPRC makes data resources readily accessible and usable to researchers and the general public and conducts data-intensive climate research activities.The bill also includes provisions that will help to improve the effectiveness of State and local justice systems to enforce the laws, bring criminals to justice, address the needs of crime victims, and prevent crime and delinquency. In particular, this bill includes $500,000 for the National Center for State Courts, NCSC, which serves as a think tank, forum, and voice for 30,000 judges, and 20,000 courthouses, in the State court system in the 50 States, DC, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, where annually 98 percent of court filings are submitted. Funding in this bill will implement the NCSC's State Courts Improvement Initiative to provide increased support services to judges, administrators, and other personnel in the State court system as well as help to shape and bolster Americans' understanding of and confidence in the Nation's judicial system. I am also pleased that this bill provides $300,000 to the Hawaii Innocence Project, which provides pro bono assistance to Hawaii prisoners with credible claims of actual innocence who no longer have access to legal resources and whose innocence may now be proven by technology unavailable at the time of their trials.To address the needs of victims and prevent crime and delinquency, I am pleased that the bill provides $400,000 to enable both the Hawaii and Kauai YWCAs to continue their programs to address sexual and domestic violence and provide services for victims of such violence. It also provides $500,000 for A Child Is Missing, ACIM, Hawaii, which will provide the critical rapid response that will assist Hawaii law enforcement agencies to locate missing children and adults. In addition, $350,000 is provided for Ka Wili Pu--Native Hawaiian for ``the blend''--which will provide 400 at-risk youth on Maui with adult guidance and adult role models and one-on-one instruction to encourage them to remain in school, fulfill their promise, avoid a problematic future with few meaningful options while promoting a healthy and stable society. To help provide cost-effective legal, medical, psychological, and social services to indigent immigrant women, the bill also provides $200,000 for the Hawaii Immigrant Justice Center to help prevent violence against women.In addition to providing for our domestic needs, the bill provides critical funding to improve our foreign relations. I am particularly pleased by two programs funded by this bill: the East West Center, which will receive $23 million, and the U.S. Institute of Peace, which will receive $19.2 million. The Hawaii-based East West Center is a premier U.S. public diplomacy program focusing on Asia and the Pacific and is a vital tool to promote U.S. values and interests in the region. The funding provided by this bill will allow existing programs to continue and provide additional funds for program enhancements and some facility upgrades.The U.S. Institute of Peace, a national center of research, education, and training on conflict management, works to resolve international conflicts by peaceful means without violence and war. The USIP was championed by former Senator Spark Matsunaga, and I am pleased to see the vital work of this institution continue, especially in this current international climate.Significant funding for military construction projects is also included in this bill, which will support the construction of troop barracks, mission critical operational facilities, support the construction needs of the Guard and Reserves, and the construction of military family housing, child care centers, and chapels. We must continue to provide for our troops and their families as they sacrifice so much for this Nation.I am particularly pleased that my request for a shipyard modernization project at the Pearl Harbor Naval Station was authorized and appropriated at $25 million. Shipyard modernization is essential to give our workers the opportunity to most efficiently maintain and repair our fleet. The Production Services Support Facility is a much needed step in the right direction. In addition, my request for an additional runway at Kona was approved as funding was included for the planning and design of a C-17 short auxiliary airfield. Once completed, this will allow Hickam AFB C-17 aircrews to complete their required training in the local area instead of travelling the 16-hour round trip to the mainland.In addition to ensuring that our military members have the facilities necessary to assist in the performance of their duties, this bill ensures that our military members are taken care of when they return home. As chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am pleased that the Omnibus appropriations bill includes strong funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, in recognition of the fact that caring for veterans is a cost of war and must be funded as such.Funding for VA would be substantially increased, billions of dollars above the previous budget. This funding will allow VA to improve care for veterans of all service-eras and further the administration's goal of opening enrollment for more than 500,000 veterans of modest incomes by providing VA with the resources to prepare for them in the coming years. The bill also fully funds VA's research programs, which are vital to improving the Department's ability to treat the signature wounds of the current conflicts and develop other improvements that will help veterans and nonveterans alike.I am delighted that for the first time VA will receive advance appropriations for fiscal year 2011 for three VA medical care accounts. This coincides with the landmark legislation, Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009, which was signed into law as Public Law 111-81 by the President on October 22, 2009. Funding VA health care in advance will go a long way toward resolving the problematic underfunding of VA health care, which left so many of the Nation's veterans with unmet health care needs.Importantly, this bill contains an amendment I offered that will extend VA's authority to operate the Manila VA Regional Office. I extend my deepest thanks to the staff of the Manila Regional Office who have continued to demonstrate unwavering dedication to their duty to assist Filipino World War II veterans and indeed all veterans who apply for benefits from VA. Earlier this year, more than 60 years after the end of the World War II, surviving Filipino World War II veterans who served under U.S. military command received a measure of compensation for their service in the form of a one-time lump sum payment. Dispersing these payments has been a significant challenge as a series of steps are required to authenticate their World War II service. In addition, the Manila Regional Office administers Social Security in the Philippines while at the same time administering compensation, pension, vocational rehabilitation, employment, and education benefits to over 18,000 individuals. Without this extension, VA's authority to operate the Manila VA Regional Office would have expired on December 31, 2009.These are just some of the projects and programs this important bill will fund for the 2010 fiscal year. Once again, I want to thank the hard work of the Appropriations Committee for bringing this bill before us today, and I urge my colleagues to support it.",

    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a technical amendment to the Act of June 18, 1934, the Indian Reorganization Act.Trust land is essential to a tribe's ability to exercise their inherent sovereignty. It allows Tribal Nations to protect their historic, cultural and religious ties to the lands where their ancestors lived. Trust lands are also vital to tribal economic development and self-government as tribes provide a wide range of governmental services to their members including, running schools, community centers, health clinics, law enforcement and numerous other social and governmental services.Federal Indian policy regarding tribal lands has not always been favorable to the Tribal governments and individuals. The General Allotment Act of 1887 led to land losses of more than 100 million acres of tribal homelands. Those land losses had a devastating effect on the tribal communities, institutions and economies that relied on their homelands. Seeking to address the consequences of that ill-advised policy, Congress enacted the Indian Reorganization Act in 1934.This act was intended to reverse the prior federal policy of allotment. By passing the Indian Reorganization Act, Congress recognized that a land base was essential for the economic advancement and self-support of Indian communities. The IRA allowed tribes to restore their homelands and to rehabilitate their economies and communities. Restoration of land to tribal ownership was central to the overall purposes of the Indian Reorganization Act.Unfortunately, a recent Supreme Court decision has brought uncertainty to 75 years interpretation regarding trust land acquisition under the Indian Reorganization Act. On February 24, 2009, the Supreme Court issued its decision in the Carcieri v. Salazar case. In that decision the Supreme Court held that the Secretary of the Interior exceeded his authority in taking land into trust for a tribe that was not under Federal jurisdiction at the time the Indian Reorganization Act was enacted in 1934. The Supreme Court decided that the act only applied to tribes who were ``under federal jurisdiction'' when it was passed in 1934.The legislation I am introducing today is necessary to clarify the continuing authority of the Secretary of the Interior, under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, to take land into trust for all Indian tribes that are federally recognized on the date the land is placed into trust. The legislation also ratifies the prior trust acquisitions of the Secretary, who for the past 75 years has been exercising his authority to take lands into trust, as intended by the Indian Reorganization Act.Inaction by Congress on the Carcieri decision will create two classes of tribes--those who are considered ``under federal jurisdiction'' and can have lands taken into trust and those who cannot. Creating two classes of tribes is unacceptable and runs counter to federal Indian policy, the Indian Reorganization Act, and subsequent Congressional Acts intended to ensure that all tribes are treated equally and have the same sovereign rights. The decision will also significantly impact planned development projects on Indian trust lands, such as housing, schools, community, and health centers, and result in a loss of jobs in an already challenging economic environment.I want to thank Senators Conrad, Franken, Inouye, Johnson, Kerry, Tester and Udall for their support on this critical legislation. My cosponsors are well aware of the negative impact this decision has already had, and would continue to have on our Native American communities. Affected tribes deserve our timely consideration of this bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of this legislation.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.",

    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to oppose the Blunt amendment, which could lead to devastating health outcomes for over 20 million women across our country. Just 2 weeks ago, I applauded the Obama administration's decision to require health insurance plans to provide coverage of FDA-approved contraception needed for women's health care without copays beginning this August. The final rule issued by the Department of Health and Human Services was a tremendous step toward improving the health of our Nation's women and their families--a step that was long overdue and one made with due respect for all Americans' religious freedom.Tomorrow, we will be voting on an amendment that would not only undo that progress, it would move us backward. What is especially frightening is that this amendment goes much further than just reversing the rule because it is not limited to religiously affiliated entities. The proposal would allow any employer or health plan issuer to refuse coverage of any service for any reason, not just religious objections. If an employee had any moral objection, it would be permitted to refuse coverage for critical care such as alcohol and other substance abuse counseling, prenatal care for single women, and mental health care too. The way this measure is worded, employees could deny screening and treatment for cervical cancer because it is related to HPV or refuse HIV-AIDS testing and treatment due to an objection to ways the viruses can be transmitted. They could even refuse to cover certain FDA-approved drugs and treatments because they object to the research that led to the drug's development.Major national pediatric organizations recently voiced their concern that if this amendment becomes law, employers who say they object to childhood vaccines on the basis of personal beliefs could refuse to cover these lifesaving and otherwise costly medical services. In short, this amendment allows corporations nationwide to overrule the religious and ethical decisions made by the people they employ and to trump the health care advice of their doctors.If this amendment passes, it will discriminate against most of those who need financial support, and that is not right. All Americans deserve access to health care. We cannot allow partisan ideology to hurt the health of our women and children. If we do, our sisters, daughters, and granddaughters will pay the price. If we defeat this amendment, the final rule will save most American women who use contraceptives hundreds of dollars each year in health care costs. Health experts agree that birth control helps to save lives, prevent unintended pregnancies, improve outcomes for children, and reduce the incidence of abortion.Another point raised by my colleagues, Senators Gillibrand and Boxer--and I thank them for promoting awareness on this issue--is that 14 percent of women who use birth control pills, and that is 1.5 million American women, use them to treat serious medical conditions. Some of these conditions include endometriosis, ovarian cysts, debilitating monthly pain, and irregular cycles.Religious principles are deeply important to me as a Christian, so I am glad the current rule accommodates conscience objections and exempts religiously affiliated organizations from both offering and paying for birth control coverage for their employees. At the same time, the core principle of ensuring all women's access to fundamental preventive health care remains protected because the care will be offered directly by the insurance companies. To deny any women access to affordable health care--as this amendment would do--is unconscionable. It could have devastating effects not only on her health but her family's as well.In speaking with women's health advocates and providers in Hawaii and across the country, one of the most common recommendations I hear for improving women's health outcomes is to ensure access to effective contraception. Across the State of Hawaii about 150,000 women seek access to birth control every year, and almost half of them depend on financial assistance to obtain it. Right now, women in States that do not have plans that cover birth control face costs of around $600 per year. Women and families who cannot afford it can end up facing tens of thousands of dollars in costs arising from complications from unintended pregnancies and other health care problems, costs that taxpayers often end up supporting.With these facts in mind, I am not surprised that a survey has shown that 71 percent of American voters--including 77 percent of Catholic women voters--support the administration's requirement to make birth control available to all women. I firmly believe religious liberty is protected under the new rule, while access to preventive care does not discriminate against anyone, no matter whom they work for or what their occupation is.I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this dangerous amendment, which would set back improvements in preventive services and women's health care in this country.I yield back the remainder of my time and suggest a quorum is not present.",

    "title": "TRIBUTES TO SENATOR BARBARA MIKULSKI",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to honor and extend my warmest aloha to my longtime colleague, a fellow member of the House freshman class of 1977, and very dear friend, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, for setting a new benchmark in her career and a significant milestone in this institution: becoming the longest serving woman in the history of the U.S. Congress. With each of her many accomplishments, she inspires the next generation of young American women, and she makes their dreams that much more attainable.My colleague from Maryland has been a true trailblazer for women in Congress. In 1987, she earned the distinction of becoming the first-ever woman U.S. Senator from Maryland, as well as the first woman Democrat to serve in both the House and the Senate. Last year, she also became the longest serving female in Senate history.Barbara has not only witnessed the number of females climb from just 21 when she first came to Congress in 1977 to the 92 female members serving today, her actions and spirit helped to make that feat possible. She continues to be a distinguished leader, mentor, and friend to all of her colleagues in Congress, not just the women. Although we have more work to do to eliminate gender bias and discrimination, I am glad to see that Congress has become more representative of the United States.Throughout her over 35 years in Congress, Barbara has remained a fearless advocate for women, working-class Americans, and Federal workers across the country, a steadfast protector of the environment, and a relentless champion of civil rights in this country.Raised by Polish-American small business owners, she has been a longtime defender of labor rights and a fierce proponent of establishing fair and equal working conditions for all Americans regardless of race, sex, or disability. This cause led her to author the landmark women's and worker's rights legislation, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which I cosponsored, to guarantee women equal pay for equal work.Being from a State that, like Maryland, has a large population of Federal workers, I have worked very closely with Barbara on many issues to support our government employees. From the time that we entered the House together, she has always been a strong partner and stalwart champion for the rights of our Nation's Federal workforce, including fair pay and benefits for the dedicated men and women who make our government more secure, effective, and efficient.Barbara is an embodiment of the democratic spirit and continues to be a leader. She uses her great wit, humor, and boundless energy to urge Congress to take up important issues and then works with Members on both sides of the aisle to resolve differences and come together to achieve real solutions that help real working Americans every day. This is a testament to the fact that as she became the longest serving woman in the history of Congress, she has never forgotten her purpose--to make America better.I again want to extend my aloha and my congratulations to Senator Barbara Mikulski for this amazing achievement. It is a pleasure to serve with you. Thank you for your many years of outstanding service and genuine friendship, and I wish you the best as you continue your important work here in Congress.",

    "title": "CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET",
    "text": "Mr. President, I think it is important that we move toward our goal, that we continue to eliminate the deficit by 2002. The amendment that I am offering considers that if the revenues do not come in as projected, then there will be an automatic adjustment that would occur through the procedure set forth to hold down spending and keep the deficit from increasing.We all recognize that the economy goes through cycles. As a member of the House Budget Committee several years ago, I felt the figures coming out of the Congressional Budget Office, built on the first 2 or 3 years prior to that, were good numbers. But I have a feeling that we are reaching the top of our economic cycle and that at some point in time we will be forced to address the problem of not meeting our projected revenues.This amendment tries to address that problem. Today, the economy is strong. People have jobs and the stock market is surging. History tells us, however, that this is not always the case. Unfortunately, the budget resolution assumes economic growth over the next 5 years that is unmatched in this country's history.The Congressional Budget Office has provided Congress with a series of revised revenue forecasts, all pointing to future economic growth. In fact, balancing the budget is $629 billion easier now than last year at this time. If these revenues do not materialize, then all of our hard work will be lost to increasing deficits. I do not want this hard work to be lost. That is why I have introduced my amendment today.The concept behind my amendment is simple: Provide a means to reduce spending within this budget agreement if real revenues fall short of those projected. This amendment will decrease discretionary spending in proportion to the revenue shortfall. This would help ensure that the budget remains on the glidepath to balance by the year 2002.I am well aware of the historic nature of this agreement and would like to back the resolution with my undivided support, but I cannot mortgage the future of my children and grandchildren on Congressional Budget Office revenue forecasts. We should make sure that the document before us today has a mechanism to secure deficit forecasts. I do not believe that this change alters the intent of the agreement, but rather enhances its ability to react to changes in the economy, changes we may never see. But we cannot be shortsighted in this matter. If we are going to craft legislation to blueprint the next 5 years, let us be smart enough to realize that we cannot see into the future. Let us be smart enough to include language that allows this agreement to react to future changes.I believe we can and should do more. We should do more in the form of tax relief for the American family, more in the form of tax relief for the family farmer, more in the form of reducing waste and duplication within the Federal Government. But I also believe that we can do more in future budget debates.My amendment is not to serve as a protest, but rather a constructive improvement to a realistic budget compromise. I served on the Budget Committee in the other body and realize how difficult it was even to get to the point where we are today. But this cannot preclude us from holding true to our commitments. This amendment locks in nothing but our commitment to balance the budget.My greatest fear is that reduced future revenues will unravel this agreement, just as we have seen with similar resolutions in the past. This amendment allows for future economic changes and would only strengthen the budget resolution.The people of Colorado sent me to Washington to balance the budget and, in the process, make sure that any budget agreement keeps the Federal budget on a glidepath to balance. I ask that my colleagues hold true to balancing the budget and support this amendment.I yield my time.",

    "text": "Mr. President, today I rise to address one of the most longstanding and racially sensitive disputes in the criminal justice system. I am introducing legislation to equalize the criminal penalties for offenses involving crack and powder cocaine.Under current law, a seller of 5 grams of crack cocaine receives the same mandatory 5-year prison term as a seller of 500 grams of powder cocaine.That disparity between penalties has been scrutinized by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, Congress, and the Clinton administration for the last several years. Although many solutions have called for narrowing the gap in penalties, these recommendations don't go far enough. Instead of equalizing the penalties, they only narrow the disparity in sentencing for powder versus crack cocaine by altering the ratio from 5 to 1 instead of the current 100 to 1.Additional recommendations have called for lessening the penalty for crack dealers, bringing it closer to the lax penalties applied to powder offenders.My legislation rejects the hollow solution of lowering the penalty for crack to make it equal to powder cocaine penalties. The fact is that 90 percent of those convicted of dealing crack are African-Americans, while the majority of powder cocaine offenders are white.Raising the powder cocaine penalties to that of crack will help alleviate the perception of unfairness and racial bias in sentencing. But reducing the penalties for crack cocaine would only increase violent crime and harm those which the law is seeking to help.Statistics remind us that cocaine addiction continues to plague our society. According to the Partnership for a Drug Free America, 1 out of every 10 babies born in the United States is born addicted to drugs, and most are addicted to crack cocaine. Crime exploded between 1985 and 1990, the years crack was introduced. In fact, violent crime went up 37 percent in 1990 and aggravated assaults increased 43 percent. Partly because of crack cocaine, more teens in this country now die of gunshot wounds than all natural causes combined. Lowering sentences on crack cocaine would be devastating to the progress we have made in fighting the drug war.During the 1980's, Congress legislated steep consequences for crack cocaine.The crack epidemic spread across our Nation--and it warranted several drastic legal reforms. We saw the destruction wrought on entire communities by this cheap and highly addictive form of cocaine and realized that tough penalties were needed to restrict its availability.These tougher sentences were needed, but the problem we are seeing today is that powder cocaine sentences were set before the crack epidemic began and do not reflect the influence powder has had on crime and drug trafficking.This bill provides a twofold solution: It corrects the inequality in penalties which has contributed to the perceived race bias in sentencing; while at the same time stiffening the penalty for powder cocaine offenses, which are currently far too lenient. By Mr. BRYAN:S. 1163. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to prohibit the distribution of any negotiable check or other instrument with any solicitation to a consumer by a creditor to open an account under any consumer credit plan or to engage in any other credit transaction which is subject to that Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will protect consumers from a new, egregious banking practice that gives new meaning to the old expression, ``The check's in the mail.''This practice involves financial institutions sending unsolicited checks to consumers, some of whom have no prior relationship with the financial institution at all. These checks in fact obligate the recipient to a loan with interest rates as high as 25 percent.I invite my colleagues' attention to a format that is frequently used. This check is sent in a window envelope in which the recipient sees his or her name, opens it up and believes that indeed a check has been sent to him or to her.What may at first appear to be pennies from Heaven is in reality a loan backed by exorbitant interest rates and punitive loan terms, but these details are only found in the fine print often on the back of the check.While only a few banks are engaged in this practice, it is nevertheless a growing practice and needs to be stopped before it gets completely out of hand. For example, one bank has booked $1 billion of these unsolicited loans in a period of 18 months.At a time when personal bankruptcies are at an all-time high --many attribute that to easy credit-card debt--the practice in which consumers are enticed into taking a loan that they really have not sought should concern all Americans.I fear for the long-term consequence of these loans should the economy take a sudden downturn and these loans are left in default.The bottom line, Mr. President, is loans should only be issued when an application has been made and approved, with the consumer fully understanding the terms of the loan. In the case of these loans, all the pertinent information consumers need to know about fees, charges, interest rates is in microscopic print and most frequently on the back of the check itself.Mr. President, banks are trying the patience of the American consumer with their ever increasing use of fees and questionable market practices.My State of Nevada has gone through a series of bank mergers that have left customers frustrated and confused. Service has been downgraded, accounts lost and fees increased. According to one report, the number of types of fees charged by banks increased from 96 to 250 while the banking industry itself continues to earn record profits--surpassing $50 billion.These unsolicited checks are setting rates right up against the usury ceilings with some carrying rates as high as 25 percent. Adding insult to injury, these checks are targeted to people who can least afford to pay these exorbitant rates but are easily tempted by the lure of easy money. By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Mack, and Mr. Helms):S. 1164. A bill to state a policy of the United States that engages the People's Republic of China in areas of mutual interest, promotes human rights, religious freedom, and democracy in China, and enhances the national security interests of the United States with respect to China, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the China Policy Act of 1997. Cosponsors of this legislation include Senators Feingold, Hutchinson, Coverdell, DeWine, Ashcroft, Brownback, Mack, and Helms.Now is the time, Mr. President, to take a closer look at our relations with the People's Republic of China. Preparations are underway for the October 28 state visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin. The President will be feted, toasted, and praised. Meanwhile, Wei Jingsheng rots in a Beijing prison, serving out a 14-year sentence for the crime of peacefully advocating democracy and other political reforms.This contrast, in my view, points up the current crisis in United States-China relations. For too long now, this administration has put process over substance, holding repeated meetings and discussions with Chinese leaders, but failing to set and hold to a concrete agenda addressing critical issues of human rights and religious freedom, as well as nuclear and other weapons proliferation.There is much of substance to work out with Chinese leaders, Mr. President. To begin with, China's record of human rights abuses and repression of religious faith is long and disturbing. Women pregnant with their second or third child have been coerced into abortions. Peaceful advocates of democracy and political reforms have been sentenced to long terms in prisons where they have been beaten, tortured, and denied needed medical care. Religious meeting places have been forcibly closed. Tibetan monks refusing to condemn their religious leader, the Dalai Lama, have been forced from their monasteries; some of their leaders have disappeared.President Clinton knows full well about these abuses. His own State Department just released a report on human rights in China which states that in 1996 ``The Government continued to commit widespread and well-documented human rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws protecting basic freedoms.'' America cannot allow these abuses of fundamental human rights to continue unopposed.Our own national security also demands that we take a firmer, more substantive stance in our dealings with China. Although China signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and agreed to abide by the terms of the missile technology control regime in 1992, violations of both agreements continue. Especially worrisome are Chinese sales of weapons technology to Pakistan, Iran, and other countries in the Middle East.Chinese weapons exports also have more directly threatened Americans here on United States soil. Companies associated with the People's Liberation Army [PLA] have been caught attempting to sell smuggled assault weapons to street gangs in Los Angeles.Mr. President, I am not advocating any rash response to these provocations. China is an important nation with the potential to take part in mutually beneficial commerce and diplomatic cooperation, or destabilize a number of important strategic areas. In my view our disagreements with China call for development of incentives and disincentives designed to steer that country toward internal liberalization and constructive participation in the international community.Up until now, debates over American policy toward China have focused almost exclusively on the annual extension of that country's most-favored-nation trading status [MFN]. Both sides in this debate have highlighted legitimate issues calling for reasoned argument. But, now that Congress has renewed MFN, it is imperative that we address broader United States-China relations, lest China policy be relegated to the back pages for another year.I firmly believe, Mr. President, that Congress and the President can put United States-Chinese relations on a course toward substantive progress by taking concrete action now. That is why I am introducing the China Policy Act of 1997. This legislation is designed to discourage the Chinese regime from oppressive internal policies and destabilizing actions contrary to United States national security, while advancing American values of freedom and human rights among the Chinese people. It represents a consensus view reached among proponents on both sides of the MFN question. It combines provisions of China-related bills and amendments authored by myself and Senators Feingold, Ashcroft, DeWine, Coverdell, and Brownback. I would like to extend special thanks to Senator Feingold for strengthening the human rights focus of the bill.This legislation includes a number of sanctions aimed at Chinese leaders intended to express our dismay at recent human rights abuses. First, the bill would deny American visas to high ranking Chinese Government officials involved in political and religious persecution. The bill also would require United States representatives at multilateral development banks to vote ``no'' on all loans to China, except those related to famine, national disaster relief, and environmental protection. This last provision also puts into practice the important principle that United States taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize the Chinese Government.In addition, Mr. President, the bill would institute targeted sanctions against PLA companies found to have engaged in weapons proliferation, illegal importation of weapons to the United States or military or political espionage in the United States. The U.S. Government also would publish a list of other PLA-controlled companies. This would allow American companies and consumers to decide whether they wish to purchase products manufactured in whole or in part by the Communist Chinese army. The bill also takes direct aim at China's use of slave labor by instituting stricter enforcement of the ban against sale of Chinese products produced in prison labor camps.These sanctions, specifically aimed at government officials and the Chinese Governmental apparatus, will show our determination to stand up and defend human rights and religious freedom.This legislation also would tighten United States export licensing requirements for supercomputers sold to China. This will impede Chinese weapons development and proliferation.In addition to its sanctions, the bill includes provisions to encourage internal reforms and cultural exchanges between our two countries. It would increase funding for international broadcasting to China, including Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America. I also would increase funding for National Endowment for Democracy and U.S. Information Agency student, cultural, and legislative exchange programs.These concrete actions would make clear to the Chinese leadership that there is a price to be paid for human rights abuses and for irresponsible weapons proliferation. They also would encourage greater openness in that country, without penalizing the Chinese people for the actions of their Government. They would provide the basis for substantive negotiations and a productive relationship with China.It is my hope that my colleagues will adopt these measures, and that the President will seize the opportunity to set our policy on a new, more productive course.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary and the full text of the China Policy Act of 1997 be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill and summary were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,(a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``China Policy Act of 1997''.

(6) A determination by the President that the Government of the People's Republic of China has taken meaningful actions toward improving overall human rights conditions in China and Tibet, including the release of political prisoners, improving prison conditions, providing prisoners with adequate medical care, and full compliance with any international human rights accords to which that government is a signatory. TITLE II--HUMAN RIGHTS, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND DEMOCRACY IN CHINACongress makes the following findings regarding human rights abuses in the People's Republic of China: (1) Congress concurs in the following conclusions of the Department of State regarding human rights in the People's Republic of China in 1996: (A) The People's Republic of China is ``an authoritarian state'' in which ``citizens lack the freedom to peacefully express opposition to the party-led political system and the right to change their national leaders or form of government''. (B) The Government of the People's Republic of China has ``continued to commit widespread and well documented human rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws protecting basic freedoms''. (C) ``Abuses include torture and mistreatment of prisoners, forced confessions, and arbitrary and incommunicado detention''. (D) ``Prison conditions remained harsh [and] [t]he Government continued severe restrictions on freedom of speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, privacy, and worker rights''. (E) ``Although the Government denies that it holds political prisoners, the number of persons detained or serving sentences for `counterrevolutionary crimes' or `crimes against the state' and for peaceful political or religious activities are believed to number in the thousands''. (F) ``Non-approved religious groups, including Protestant and Catholic groups . . . experienced intensified repression''. (G) ``Serious human rights abuses persist in minority areas, including Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia [, and] [c]ontrols on religion and other fundamental freedoms in these areas have also intensified''. (H) ``Overall in 1996, the authorities stepped up efforts to cut off expressions of protest or criticism. All public dissent against the party and government was effectively silenced by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison terms, administrative detention, or house arrest. No dissidents were known to be active at year's end.''. (2) People's Republic of China authorities continue to hold Wei Jingsheng in prison for his prodemocracy beliefs, and he is suffering in prison from a lack of medical attention and beatings by fellow prisoners. (3) On October 30, 1996, a People's Republic of China court sentenced Wang Dan to 11 years in prison primarily for articles published outside the People's Republic of China, and People's Republic of China authorities are not providing him with adequate medical care. (4) In addition to Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, hundreds, if not thousands, of other political, religious, and labor dissidents are imprisoned in China for peacefully expressing their beliefs and exercising their internationally recognized rights of free association and expression. (5) Labor activist Liu Nianchun, severely ill in a labor camp, has not only been denied medical treatment but has been tortured with electric batons and has had his 3 year reeducation-through-labor sentence in prison arbitrarily extended by 216 days. (6) Li Hai was charged with prying into and gathering state secrets and subsequently sentenced to a 9-year term in prison on December 18, 1996, for going door-to-door to collect the names, ages, family situations, alleged crimes, lengths of prison sentences, locations of imprisonment, and treatment while imprisoned of people sentenced to prison for their activities during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. (7) Gao Yu, serving a 6-year term in prison on charges of ``leaking state secrets'' despite the fact that the information in question was already common knowledge, has been denied medical parole and adequate medical care despite life threatening illness and was vilified by People's Republic of China authorities after she was awarded the UNESCO Guillemo Cano World Press Freedom Prize. (8) People's Republic of China companies still export prison labor products to the United States. Since 1991, the United States Customs Service has issued 27 detention orders banning the importation of goods suspected to be products of prison labor in China, including hand tools, artificial flowers, Christmas tree lights, and diesel engines. (9) The People's Republic of China has not fully complied with the 1992 Memorandum of Understanding on Prison Labor, and People's Republic of China authorities often wait several years before granting requests by United States Customs Service officials to inspect prison facilities in China. In 1996, such authorities granted just one of eight outstanding requests by such officials to inspect prison facilities in China. (10) Under current law, People's Republic of China authorities may administratively sentence China citizens to 3 years of labor reform without trial. (11) The People's Republic of China restricts the access of its citizens to the Internet and blocks web sites operated by foreign news organizations and human rights organizations. (12) The Government of the People's Republic of China prohibits independent labor unions, and workers who attempt to form unions without state approval are given severe prison sentences as shown in the treatment of Zhang Jingsheng, a labor leader in Hunan province who was arrested following the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre and sentenced to 13 years in prison for organizing workers.Congress makes the following findings regarding religious freedom in the People's Republic of China: (1) The Government of the People's Republic of China restricts the ability of religious adherents, including Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, and others, to practice outside of state-approved religious organizations, and detains worshipers and clergy who participate in religious services conducted outside state-approved religious organizations, as well as those who refuse to register with the authorities as required. (2) Bishop Zeng Jingmu, 76 years old, detained for the third time in 7 months and in poor health from pneumonia, is serving a reeducation through labor term for organizing religious assemblies and masses not sanctioned by the official Chinese Catholic Church. (3) On January 31, 1994, Premier Li Peng signed decrees number 144 and 145 which restrict worship, religious education, distribution of Bibles and others religious literature, and contact with foreign coreligionists. (4) The Government of the People's Republic of China has created official religious organizations that control all religious worship, activity, and association in China and Tibet and supplant the independent authority of the Roman Catholic Church, independent Protestant churches, and independent Buddhist, Taoist, and Islamic associations. (5) In July 1995, Ye Xiaowen, a rigid communist hostile to religion, was appointed to head the Bureau of Religious Affairs, a government agency of the People's Republic of China that is controlled by the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party. The Bureau of Religious Affairs has administrative control over all religious worship and activity in China and Tibet through a system of granting or denying rights through an official registration system. Those who fail to or are not allowed to register are subject to punitive measures. (6) Unofficial Christian and Catholic communities were targeted by the Government of the People's Republic of China during 1996. A renewed campaign aimed at forcing all churches to register or face dissolution resulted in beating and harassment of congregants, closure of churches, and numerous arrests, fines, and sentences. In Shanghai, for example, more than 300 house churches or meeting points were closed down by the security authorities in April alone.Congress makes the following findings regarding Tibet: (1) The Department of State China Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1996 states: ``Chinese government authorities continued to commit widespread human rights abuses in Tibet, including instances of death in detention, torture, arbitrary arrest, detention without public trial, long detention of Tibetan nationalists for peacefully expressing their religious and political views, and intensified controls on religion and on freedom of speech and the press, particularly for ethnic Tibetans.''. (2) The report also cites three instances in which Tibetan Buddhist monks died in prison in the People's Republic of China in 1996. (3) Many victims of the brutality committed by the People's Armed Police and the Public Security Bureau of the People's Republic of China have been young Tibetan Buddhist nuns and monks. (4) Between June 1994 and May 1995, three Tibetan nuns--15- year-old Sherab Ngawang, 24-year-old Gyaltsen Kelsang, and 20-year-old Phuntsok Yangkyi--died as a result of torture in prison in Tibet. (5) On March 11, 1997, the Senate adopted a resolution calling for the release by the Government of the People's Republic of China of Tibetan ethnomusicologist and Fulbright Scholar Ngawang Choephel, who was sentenced to 18 years in prison in the People's Republic of China in December 1996, and of other Tibetans who are prisoners in the People's Republic of China for reasons of conscience. (6) In May 1995, authorities of the Government of the People's Republic of China detained Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, then 6 years old, and his parents, just days after the boy was recognized by the Dalai Lama as the 11th Panchen Lama, and authorities of that government continue to hold him and his family. (7) In May 1997, the Government of the People's Republic of China announced the sentencing of Chadrel Rinpoche, the head of the search committee for the 11th Panchen Lama, to 6 years in prison. (8) In April 1996, authorities of the Government of the People's Republic of China banned the display of photographs of the Dalai Lama, even in private homes, and the decision led to demonstrations in Ganden monastery during which 90 monks were arrested and 1 monk was shot to death by security forces of that government.Congress makes the following findings regarding family planning practices in the People's Republic of China: (1) For more than 15 years there have been frequent and credible reports of forced abortion and forced sterilization in connection with the coercive population control practices of the People's Republic of China. (2) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal. (3) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion and forced sterilization have no role in the population control program of the Government of the People's Republic of China, the policy of that government seems to encourage both forced abortion and forced sterilization through a combination of strictly enforced birth quotas and impunity for local population control officials who engage in coercion. Officials acknowledge that there have been instances of forced abortions and sterilization, yet there is no evidence that the perpetrators of such acts have been punished. (4) The People's Republic of China population control officials, in cooperation with employers and works unit officials, monitor women's menstrual cycles and subject women who conceive without government authorization to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic sanctions (including unpayable fines and loss of employment), and to physical force. (5) Official sanctions for giving birth to unauthorized children include fines in amounts several times larger than the per capita annual incomes of residents of the People's Republic of China. In Fujian, for example, the average fine is estimated to be twice a family's gross annual income. Families who cannot pay the fine have had their homes and personal property confiscated and destroyed. (6) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on those whose resistance to such policies is motivated by religion. For example, according to a 1995 Amnesty International report, the Catholic inhabitants of two villages in Hebei Province were subjected to population control under the slogan ``better to have more graves than one more child''. Enforcement measures included torture, sexual abuse, and the detention of resisters' relatives as hostages. (7) Forced abortions in the People's Republic of China often take place in the very late stages of pregnancy, or even during the process of birth itself.(a) Authorizations for Appropriations for Additional Monitoring of Exportation of Slave Labor Products.--There are authorized to be appropriated $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1998 and $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 for monitoring by the United States Customs Service and the Department of State of the export by the People's Republic of China to the United States of products which may be made with slave labor in violation of section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307) or section 1761 of title 18, United States Code. (b) Reports on Exportation of Products Made With Slave Labor.-- (1) Reports.-- (A) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the Commissioner of Customs and the Secretary of State shall each submit to the Members of Congress referred to in subparagraph (B) a report on the manufacturing and exportation of products made with slave labor in the People's Republic of China during the one-year period ending on the date of the report. Each report shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified annex. (B) Members of congress.--Reports under subparagraph (A) shall be submitted to the following Members of Congress: (i) The Majority leader and Minority leader of the Senate. (ii) The chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate. (iii) The Speaker and Minority leader of the House of Representatives. (iv) The chairman and ranking member of the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives. (2) Contents of reports.--Each report under paragraph (1) shall include information concerning the following: (A) The extent of the use of slave labor in manufacturing products for exportation by the People's Republic of China, as well as the volume of exports of such slave labor products by that country. (B) The progress of the United States Government-- (i) in identifying products made with slave labor in the People's Republic of China that are destined for the United States market in violation of section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 or section 1761 of title 18, United States Code; and (ii) in stemming the importation of such products. (c) Renegotiation of Memorandum of Understanding on Prison Labor With the People's Republic of China.--It is the sense of Congress that, since the People's Republic of China has substantially frustrated the purposes of the 1992 Memorandum of Understanding with the United States on Prison Labor, the President should immediately commence negotiations to replace the memorandum of understanding with one providing for effective monitoring of forced labor in the People's Republic of China, without restrictions on which prison labor camps international monitors may visit.(a) Authorization of Appropriations.--In addition to such sums as are otherwise authorized to be appropriated for ``International Broadcasting Activities'' for fiscal year 1998, there is authorized to be appropriated for ``International Broadcasting Activities'' for that fiscal year $5,000,000, which shall be available only for broadcasting by Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America to the People's Republic of China. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that United States international broadcasting through Radio Free Asia and Voice of America should be increased to provide continuous 24-hour broadcasting in Chinese and Tibetan dialects which include Mandarin Chinese, Tibetan, and at In addition to such sums as are otherwise authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 1998 for grants to the National Endowment for Democracy, there is authorized to be appropriated for that fiscal year $2,000,000 for grants to the Endowment which shall be available only for purposes of programs relating to the People's Republic of China.In addition to such sums as are otherwise authorized to be appropriated to the United States Information Agency for fiscal year 1998, there is authorized to be appropriated for the Agency for that fiscal year $2,000,000, which shall be available only for the purposes of student, cultural, and legislative exchange activities in or with the People's Republic of China.(a) Annual Reports.-- (1) Requirement.--Not later than January 15 each year, the Secretary of State shall submit to Congress a report that describes the family planning activities in the People's Republic of China during the preceding year of each covered family planning organization that carried out such activities in the People's Republic of China during that year. (2) Additional information.--Each report under paragraph (1) shall include the filing submitted to the Secretary for purposes of such report by each covered family planning organization whose activities are covered by such report. (b) Covered Family Planning Organization Defined.--In this section, the term ``covered family planning organization'' means any for-profit or non-profit entity that receives United States funds to conduct family planning activities abroad.(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) On April 15, 1997, members of the United Nations Human Rights Commission voted 27-17 to block a resolution, sponsored by Denmark, critical of the human rights record of the Government of the People's Republic of China. (2) The United States Government failed to vigorously lobby other nations to support the resolution in a timely and effective manner, and France, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia, and Japan did not cosponsor the resolution. (3) In response to support for the resolution by Denmark and the Netherlands, the Government of the People's Republic of China has adopted punitive measures against Denmark and Netherlands businesses--including the denial of contracts to Netherlands companies and undue delays in authorizing expansion plans by the Denmark shipping line Maersk--thereby linking human rights and trade. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) the United States Government should greatly increase efforts in the United Nations Human Rights Commission and other international fora to draw attention to and condemn the gross violations of international standards on human rights by the Government of the People's Republic of China; (2) the President should vigorously lobby other countries for passage of future Commission resolutions on the human rights record of the Government of the People's Republic of China; and (3) such lobbying should begin not later than 6 months before the commencement of the next annual meeting of the Commission.(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) The People's Republic of China resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997. (2) In the Joint Declaration, a legally binding document in all its parts and the highest form of commitment between sovereign states, the People's Republic of China pledged that after its resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong ``[t]he current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain unchanged, and so will the life-style. Rights and freedoms, including those of the person, of speech, of the press, of association, of travel, of movement, of correspondence, of strike, of choice of occupation, of academic research and religious belief will be ensured by law in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region''. (3) The People's Republic of China further pledged in the Joint Declaration that the policies of the ``. . . Joint Declaration will be stipulated in a Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, by the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, and they will remain unchanged for 50 years''. (4) The Basic Law prescribes the systems to be practiced in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after the resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong by the People's Republic of China. (5) According to Article 2 of the Basic Law: ``The National People's Congress authorizes the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication''. (6) According to Article 5 of the Basic Law: ``The socialist system and policies (of the People's Republic of China) shall not be practiced in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years''. (7) According to Article 27 of the Basic Law: ``Hong Kong residents shall have freedom of speech, of the press and publication; freedom of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration; and the right and freedom to form and join trade unions, and to strike''. (8) According to Article 32 of the Basic Law: ``Hong Kong residents shall have freedom of religious belief and freedom to preach and to conduct and participate in religious activities in public''. (9) According to Article 34 of the Basic Law: ``Hong Kong residents shall have freedom to engage in academic research, literary and artistic creation, and other cultural activities''. (10) According to Article 39 of the Basic Law: ``The provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and international labour conventions as applied to Hong Kong shall remain in force and shall be implemented through the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region''. (11) President Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of China, in his statement of July 1, 1997, at the ceremony in Hong Kong marking the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said that ``. . . Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy as provided for by the Basic Law, which includes the executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication''. (12) President Jiang further said that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has the ``ultimate aim of electing the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council by universal suffrage''. (13) President Jiang further said that ``[n]o central department or locality (of the People's Republic of China) may or will be allowed to interfere in the affairs which, under the Basic Law, should be administered by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on its own''. (14) President Jiang further said that ``the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and international covenants as applied to Hong Kong shall remain in force to be implemented through the laws of Hong Kong's regional legislation''. (15) President Jiang further said that adherence to these principles ``serves Hong Kong, serves the (People's Republic of China) and serves the entire nation as well. Therefore there is no reason whatsoever to change them. Here I want to reaffirm that `one country, two systems, Hong Kong administering Hong Kong' and `a high degree of autonomy' will remain unchanged for 50 years''. (16) President Jiang, in another statement of July 1, 1997, at a rally in Beijing marking the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said that the People's Republic of China ``will unswervingly carry out the principles of `one country, two systems', `Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong' and `high degree of autonomy', and make sure that the previous socio-economic system and way of life of Hong Kong remain unchanged and that laws previously in force will remain basically unchanged. We will firmly support the Hong Kong SAR in its exercise of the functions and powers bestowed on it by the Basic Law and the Hong Kong SAR Government in its administration in accordance with law.''. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) the statements of President Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of China constitute a welcome reaffirmation of the obligations of the People's Republic of China under the Joint Declaration to ensure that Hong Kong remains autonomous, the human rights of the people of Hong Kong remain protected, and the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is elected democratically; and (2) the fulfillment by the People's Republic of China of the obligations under the terms of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law constitutes a crucial test of Beijing's ability to play a responsible global role. (c) Definitions.--In this section: (1) Basic Law.--The term ``Basic Law'' means the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, as adopted on April 4, 1990, by the Seventh National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China. (2) Joint declaration.--The term ``Joint Declaration'' means the Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong, done at Beijing on December 19, 1984.Congress makes the following findings regarding the proliferation of ballistic missiles by the People's Republic of China: (1) In December 1992, the Government of the People's Republic of China violated the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act of 1979 with the transfer by the Ministry of Aerospace Industry of approximately 24 M-11 missiles to Sargodha Air Force Base in Pakistan. (2) From September 1994 to June 1996, the Government of the People's Republic of China again violated the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act of 1979 with the transfer by the Ministry of Aerospace Industry of as many as 30 M-11 ballistic missiles to Sargodha Air Force Base. (3) In June 1995, the Government of the People's Republic of China violated the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act of 1979 with the transfer by the Chinese Aerospace Corporation to Iran of possibly hundreds of missile guidance systems and computerized machine tools for the production of ballistic missiles. (4) In August 1996, the Government of the People's Republic of China violated the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act of 1979 with the transfer to Pakistan of factory plans and equipment capable of constructing a ballistic missile factory. (5) In August 1996, the Government of the People's Republic of China violated the Arms Export Control Act, the Export Administration Act of 1979, and the Iran-Iraq Arms Non- Proliferation Act of 1992 with the transfer by the China Precision Engineering Institute to Iran's Defense Industries of gyroscopes, accelerometers, and test equipment for the construction and test of ballistic missile guidance systems. (6) It has been reported that the Central Intelligence Agency discovered a shipment by the People's Republic of China to the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center, a Syria Government agency that oversees missile development, of guidance equipment for M-11 ballistic missiles. This alleged shipment would be a violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime. This alleged shipment would have taken place after the limited sanctions imposed by the United States on the People's Republic of China for shipments of M-11 missiles and components to Pakistan had been lifted following the assurances of the Government of the People's Republic of China that it would comply with the Missile Technology Control Regime. (7) After each of these violations, the President either failed to take appropriate actions to deter future violations of such Acts and the Regime, took the least onerous action against the Government of the People's Republic of China that was possible under such Acts and the Regime, or rescinded previous actions thereby diluting or eliminating the deterrent effect of sanctions under such Acts and the Regime with respect to the Government of the People's Republic of China. (8) This inaction forces Congress to take affirmative action in the bilateral relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China in order to respond sufficiently to these violations of United States law.Congress makes the following findings regarding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by the People's Republic of China: (1) In January 1996, the Government of the People's Republic of China violated the Arms Export Control Act, the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994, and the Export- Import Bank Act of 1945 with the transfer by the China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation to the Abdul Qadeer Khan Research Laboratory in Kahuta, Pakistan, of as many as 5,000 ring-magnets for the extraction of enriched uranium for the potential use in nuclear weapons. (2) In September 1996, the Government of the People's Republic of China violated the Arms Export Control Act, the Export Administration Act of 1979, and the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 with the transfer by the China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation to a nuclear reactor facility in Khushab, Pakistan, of an industrial furnace and special diagnostic equipment capable of converting plutonium and uranium to weapons grade material. (3) In March 1996, the Government of the People's Republic of China violated the Arms Export Control Act, the Export Administration Act of 1979, the Iran-Iraq Arms Non- Proliferation Act of 1992, and Executive Order 12938 with the transfer by the Jiangsu Corporation to Iran organizations affiliated with the Iranian Defense Industries Organization and the Revolutionary Guards of virtually complete chemical weapons production facilities. (4) After each of these violations, the President either failed to take any action to deter future violations of such Acts or took such trifling action as to have no meaning or effect on the future proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by the People's Republic of China. (5) This inaction forces Congress to take affirmative action in the bilateral relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States in order to respond sufficiently to these violations of United States law.Congress makes the following findings regarding the proliferation of destabilizing advanced conventional weapons by the People's Republic of China: (1) In January 1996, the Government of the People's Republic of China violated the Iran-Iraq Arms Non- Proliferation Act of 1992 with the transfer by the Chinese Precision Machinery Import-Export Corporation to the Iran military of 60 C-802 advanced anti-ship missiles and 20 Houdong fast-attack patrol craft, 15 of which were equipped with C-802 missiles. (2) In test firings of this missile from land-based batteries and from naval vessels, and test firings of a similar missile from fighter aircraft, the Iran Government claimed direct hits on the intended targets. This operational ability restores an anti-surface warfare capability lost by the Iran military during the Iran-Iraq War. (3) The Commander of the United States Fifth Fleet commented that these missiles represented a new dimension to the threat faced by the United States Navy, stating ``[i]t used to be we just had to worry about land-based cruise missiles. Now [the Iranians] have the potential to have that throughout the [Persian] Gulf mounted on ships.''. (4) It was reported in numerous press sources that the Department of Defense found these transfers destabilizing, and pressed for the imposition of sanctions under the Iran- Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 but that the Department of State did not wish to impose such sanctions for fear of damaging bilateral relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States. (5) The Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 does not differentiate between transfers of destabilizing weapons that will and will not damage bilateral relations. Any determination of whether to impose sanctions on the People's Republic of China for this transfer should have been made strictly on the basis whether this transfer was or was not destabilizing. (6) In light of these reports, it is likely that sanctions would have been imposed if the Clinton Administration had been more concerned with the stability of the region and the security of United States troops than with the maintenance of cordial relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States. (7) This inaction forces Congress to take affirmative action in the bilateral relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States in order to respond sufficiently to this violation of United States law.Congress makes the following findings regarding the evasion of United States export control laws by the People's Republic of China: (1) On November 14, 1994, the President issued Executive Order 12938, relating to the emergency regarding weapons of mass destruction, declaring that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them constitute ``an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States'' and that he had therefore decided to ``declare a national emergency to deal with that threat''. (2) The President reaffirmed Executive Order 12938 on November 15, 1995, and again on November 11, 1996. (3) The Director of Central Intelligence stated in the report entitled ``The Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions'' that, from July to December 1996, ``China was the most significant supplier of W[eapons of] M[ass] D[estruction]-related goods and technology to foreign countries.''. (4) United States supercomputers are the computer of choice for the nuclear weapons agencies of the People's Republic of China as highlighted by the comments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, an agency known to work on nuclear weapons development, that its United States-built supercomputer provides the Academy with ``computational power previously unknown'' and is available to ``all the major scientific and technological institutes across China''. (5) The People's Republic of China has consistently provided technical and scientific assistance for the development of nuclear weapons to both Iran and Pakistan, and it is illogical to believe that such assistance would not also include computational assistance if needed. (6) According to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration, 47 United States high-performance supercomputers were exported to the People's Republic of China between January 1996 and March 1997. Press reports indicate United States intelligence sources consider the actual number of such supercomputers exported to the People's Republic of China during that period to have been in the hundreds. (7) Current United States export regulations require an export license for shipments of supercomputers to the People's Republic of China only if the end-use will be militarily related. However, the determination of that end- use is left to the exporter, thereby providing an incentive for inadequate investigations of the end-use of supercomputers exported to the People's Republic of China. (8) The Department of Commerce has initiated investigations of United States supercomputer manufacturers who, as last as June 1996, allegedly sold supercomputers to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which also administers research in nuclear weapons and missiles, in violation of existing United States export control regulations relating to supercomputers. (9) On 14 July 1997, the ``China Daily'', the newspaper of the Government of the People's Republic of China, stated that ``China will open up its defense sector to foreign investors'' by ``strengthening international military-related electronic technology exchanges'' and that ``China's defense- related electronics should no longer be hidden from foreign investors''. (10) It was exactly this concern of diversion to military end-use and to third nation proliferators that prompted the President, on June 16, 1997, to tighten export controls for supercomputers so as to address the concern of ``[t]he potential diversion to military use of technology acquired'' through experience developed in operating supercomputers and customizing software and the concern that ``the People's Republic of China may transfer advanced-weapons related technology to other countries, as in the case of ballistic missile transfers''. (11) Throughout this period, the President has consistently acted in a manner so as to loosen controls on the export of supercomputers from the United States and thereby make it easier for the Government of the People's Republic of China to divert United States supercomputers to military end-uses and to assist in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. (12) This inaction forces Congress to take affirmative action in the bilateral relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States in order to respond sufficiently to these violations of United States law.Congress makes the following findings regarding the inconsistent application of United States export control laws to the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong: (1) While Hong Kong was sovereign territory of the United Kingdom, United States control of United States exports to Hong Kong of items listed on the United States Munitions List and the Commerce Control List was considerably more lax than United States control of exports of such items to the People's Republic of China. (2) On June 19, 1997, at a time when Hong Kong was still territory of the United Kingdom, the Department of Commerce discovered that a supercomputer exported to a Hong Kong based company without the need of an export license because it was being exported to Hong Kong was reexported to a defense research institute in Changsha, People's Republic of China. (3) A Federal grand jury is currently investigating the 1995 diversion by the Government of the People's Republic of China to military aviation production of aircraft machining equipment that was originally exported from the United States for civilian end-use. (4) The People's Republic of China is the only country which does not allow United States officials to investigate the final end-use of exported technology and recently refused United States requests to examine the location of the supercomputer diverted from Hong Kong. (5) The continuation of this inconsistent export control regime without specific assurances and verification measures to prevent unauthorized reexport from Hong Kong, or diversion to military end-use, provides the Government of the People's Republic of China with the means to circumvent United States export controls and gain access to critical technology necessary both for defense modernization and the proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction. (6) This inaction forces Congress to take affirmative action in the bilateral relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States in order to respond sufficiently to these violations of United States law.(a) Prior Approval of Exports and Reexports.--The President shall require that no covered computer may be exported or reexported to the People's Republic of China without the prior written approval of each of the designated officials. (b) Export or Reexport Without Unanimous Approval.--If any one of the designated officials does not approve of the export or reexport of a covered computer to the People's Republic of China, the computer may be exported or reexported to the People's Republic of China only pursuant to a license issued by the Secretary of Commerce under the export administration regulations of the Department of Commerce, and without regard to the licensing exceptions otherwise authorized under section 740.7 of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on June 10, 1997. (c) Deadline for Response to Application.--Each designated official shall approve or disapprove in writing of the export or reexport of a covered computer to the People's Republic of China not later than 10 days after receipt by the United States of the application for the export or reexport of the computer. (d) Definitions.--In this section: (1) Covered computers.--The term ``covered computers'' means the digital computers listed as ``eligible computers'' in section 740.7(d)(2) of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on June 10, 1997. (2) Designated officials.--The term ``designated officials'' means the following: (1) The Secretary of Commerce. (2) The Secretary of Defense. (3) The Secretary of Energy. (4) The Secretary of State. (5) The Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the provisions of this section shall apply with respect to exports of covered items to Hong Kong. (b) Pre-License Verifications.--The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce shall not approve an export license application for the export of a covered item to Hong Kong if United States officials are denied an opportunity to conduct a pre-license verification with respect to the end-use of such covered item and the recipient of such item. (c) Post-Shipment Verification.--If United States officials are denied the ability to a conduct post-shipment verification of the location, recipient, and end use of a covered item that has been exported to Hong Kong from the United States pursuant to an export license granted by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce, thereafter any application to export a covered item to Hong Kong shall be treated in the same manner as a request to export such item to the People's Republic of China. (d) Diversion of Covered Items.--If the President, or any other official of the United States, obtains credible evidence that a covered item exported from the United States to Hong Kong on or after July 1, 1997, has been diverted-- (1) to the People's Republic of China; (2) to an end use not authorized under the export control laws or regulations of the United States, or (3) to a recipient, other than the recipient specified in the export license application,(a) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United States that-- (1) the delivery of 60 C-802 cruise missiles by the China National Precision Machinery Import Export Corporation to Iran poses a new, direct threat to deployed United States forces in the Middle East and materially contributed to the efforts of Iran to acquire destabilizing numbers and types of advanced conventional weapons; and (2) the delivery is a violation of the Iran-Iraq Arms Non- Proliferation Act of 1992 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note). (b) Implementation of Sanctions.-- (1) Requirement.--The President shall impose on the People's Republic of China the mandatory sanctions set forth in paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) of section 1605(b) of the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992. (2) Nonavailability of waiver.--For purposes of this section, the President shall not have the authority contained in section 1606 of the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 to waive the sanctions required under paragraph (1).(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Credible allegations exist that the People's Republic of China has transferred equipment and technology as follows: (A) Gyroscopes, accelerometers, and test equipment for missiles to Iran. (B) Chemical weapons equipment and technology to Iran. (C) Missile guidance systems and computerized machine tools to Iran. (D) Industrial furnace equipment and high technology diagnostic equipment to a nuclear facility in Pakistan. (E) Blueprints and equipment to manufacture M-11 missiles to Pakistan. (F) M-11 missiles and components to Pakistan. (2) The Department of State has failed to determine whether most such transfers violate provisions of relevant United States laws and Executive orders relating to the proliferation of sensitive equipment and technology, including the Arms Export Control Act, the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994, the Export Administration Act of 1979, and the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, and Executive Order 12938. (3) Where the Department of State has made such determinations, it has imposed the least onerous form of sanction, which significantly weakens the intended deterrent effect of the sanctions provided for in such laws. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) the transfers of equipment and technology by the People's Republic of China described in subsection (a)(1) pose a threat to the national security interests of the United States; (2) the failure of the Clinton Administration to initiate a formal process to determine whether to impose sanctions for such transfers under the provisions of law referred to in subsection (a)(2) contributes to the threat posed to the national security interests of the United States by the proliferation of such equipment and technology; and (3) the President should immediately initiate the procedures necessary to determine whether sanctions should be imposed under such provisions of law for such transfers. (c) Report.-- (1) Requirement.--Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to Congress a report setting forth-- (A) the date, if any, of the commencement and of the conclusion of each formal process conducted by the Department of State to determine whether to impose sanctions under the provisions of law referred to in subsection (a)(2) for each transfer described in subsection (a)(1); (B) the facts providing the basis for each determination not to impose sanctions under such provisions of law on the Government of the People's Republic of China, or entities within or having a relationship with that government, for each transfer, and the legal analysis supporting such determination; and (C) a schedule for initiating a formal process described in paragraph (1) for each transfer not yet addressed by such formal process and an explanation for the failure to commence such formal process with respect to such transfer before the date of the report. (2) Form.--The report shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.(a) Entities Owned by PLA.--Not later than January 31 each year, the Secretary of State shall publish in the Federal Register a list of each corporation or other business entity that was owned in whole or in part by the People's Liberation Army of the People's Republic of China as of December 31 of the preceding year.

    "text": "Mr. President, I spent the month of January attending town meetings throughout the State of Colorado. That is one of the things, when I go back to my State, that I spend a lot of time doing--visiting the counties and visiting with the people of Colorado. Over the years, we continue to have the issue of taxes brought up in the town meetings--probably more so now than at any time that I can recall since having town meetings.The American people simply want to have their tax system reformed, particularly those in Colorado. They want lower taxes, they want a simpler tax system, and they want less intrusive means of collecting those taxes.Last year, Congress enacted modest tax relief, but it was only a first step. It's time to move forward with more aggressive tax reform.Today, I am introducing legislation that will do four things:It will continue to reduce the capital gains tax to a top rate of 14 percent.It will restore the one-year holding period for capital gains treatment.It will index capital gains and, thereby, eliminate the taxation of gains that are due solely to inflation.And then, finally, it will eliminate the estate tax.These changes will provide important tax relief for families and businesses, and continue to ensure that our economy remains the most competitive in the world.Mr. President, the new year has certainly brought good news concerning the Federal budget. But let's be honest. The budget is balancing because of the hard work of the American people, not because of any bold action by the Federal Government. Economic performance in recent years has exceeded all expectations. The result is that the American people have been sending greater and greater amounts of their earnings to Washington. The budget is balancing because of an explosion in tax receipts, not because of any restraint in spending. In fact, the budget continues to grow at a healthy pace. Federal spending in 1998 is estimated to be 4.3 percent above the 1997 level--well in excess of inflation. Many would like this to continue.The President assured us in a previous State of the Union Address that, ``the era of big Government is over.'' But it is clear that he is now proposing a new era of big Government.I favor a different course. We should not squander the people's surplus on more Government. Instead, we should begin to pay down the debt and reform the tax system. We should put American families ahead of the insatiable appetite of Washington, DC, for more Government spending.Despite last year's budget bill, taxes remain higher than they have ever been. Tax freedom day--the day to which the average American works to pay the combined Federal, State, and local tax burden--is May 9, which is the latest it has ever been. A reduction in the Federal debt and a reasonable level of taxation should be the twin objectives of Congress as we enter the next century. Our job is to ensure that the bridge to the 21st century does not become a toll bridge.Mr. President, let me begin with a discussion of capital gains taxes. I call the capital gains tax the ``growth tax.'' Nearly all Americans own capital, and they experience a tax on that capital when they sell the stocks, or a small business, or a farm.Mr. President, let's look at how this capital gains, or growth tax, hits ordinary working Americans. Stock ownership has doubled in the last 7 years, to the point where 43 percent of all adult Americans own stock. Obviously, with those numbers, stock ownership is not just confined to the wealthy; it is spread throughout society. Today, half of the investors are women, and half are noncollege graduates. Stocks are typically held for retirement, education expenses, and other long-term goals. This is precisely the type of saving and investing that we need in our economy.Mr. President, I can't leave this topic without talking about small business owners and farmers. There is no clearer area where the ``growth tax'' makes no sense. Millions of American families put their lives into building small businesses and farms. Often, those businesses or farms are sold to finance a decent retirement. But this can only occur after Uncle Sam gets his cut of one-third or more of all the gains.Simply put, low taxation makes it less costly to take the risks that are critical in a capitalist economy. I am proposing that we enact a maximum capital gains tax of 14 percent, with those in the lowest tax bracket paying only 7 percent. Last year's reduction of the capital gains rate was a big plus, but it came with a price--the holding period required to qualify for the lower tax was extended from 12 months to 18 months.The holding period change is a poor attempt by the Government to micromanage the economy. This is the type of Government management that has so clearly failed in Asia. A market economy functions best when capital flows freely, unencumbered by Government distortions. The holding period for long-term capital gains treatment has been 12 months for years, and it should stay that way.Mr. President, an additional mistake that Congress made in last year's bill was a failure to include indexing. The real ``growth tax'' is often much higher than 20 percent. This is because our Tax Code does not protect Americans from taxation on capital gains that result from inflation. This is one of the most unfair aspects of the growth tax. Government policies contribute to inflation, and Government turns around and taxes its citizens on that inflation.For this reason, I fought hard to see that indexing was included last year. I offered an amendment to the tax bill that would have added indexing. The amendment was carefully structured to avoid any revenue loss. Obviously, I was disappointed with the defeat of this amendment. I presume that this was due largely to the President's opposition to indexing and his veto threat. Despite this, we got a strong vote, and I promised that I would be back.I have included indexing in this bill, and I fully intend to offer this at each opportunity. Some have dismissed indexing as ``too costly,'' but for me this is an issue of fundamental fairness. It is wrong for the Federal Government to tax citizens on inflation.Since I mentioned the issue of cost, let me make a few points on this. I have long maintained that a capital gains tax cut will increase revenue. In the short run, it encourages the sale of assets that would not otherwise occur. This obviously increases revenue.In the long run, a rate cut facilitates a higher level of economic growth. This also results in greater tax revenue.Unfortunately, during last year's tax debate, we continued to operate under revenue models that forecast a loss to the government from the capital gains rate cut.I hope we can soon put this notion to rest for good.It is already apparent that capital gains revenues will be coming into the Treasury at a considerably higher level than forecast last year when we were talking about capital gains. 1998 capital gains revenues could be as much as 50% higher than previously forecast.Even state governments will benefit from the rate cut. Earlier this month, analysts for the Colorado Legislature forecast that the capital gains tax changes would result in an additional $38 million this year for the Colorado state budget.Obviously, the impact at the federal level will be many times greater.The final provision in this tax bill is the elimination of the estate tax.Frankly, the estate tax makes no sense.While the tax raises only 1 percent of federal revenues, it destroys family businesses and farms.The estate tax is double taxation.At the time of a person's death, much of their farm, business, and life savings has already been subjected to federal, state, and local tax. These same assets are taxed again under the estate tax.The estate tax fails to distinguish between cash and non-liquid assets.Family businesses are often asset-rich, and cash poor. But the value of all assets must be included in the taxable estate.This can force liquidations, and family businesses can see their livelihood eliminated in order to pay a tax of up to 55 percent. Yes. That is right--up to 55 percent.This practice threatens the stability of our families and communities while inhibiting growth and economic development.The National Center for Policy Analysis reports that a 1995 survey by Travis Research Associates found that 51 percent of family businesses would have difficulty surviving the estate tax, 14 percent of business owners said it would be impossible to survive, 30 percent said they would have to sell part or all of their business.This is supported by a 1995 Family Business Survey conducted by Matthew Greenwald and Associates which found that 33% of family businesses anticipate having to liquidate or sell part of their business to pay the estate tax.Recently, the accounting firm Price Waterhouse calculated the taxable components of 1995 estates. While 21% of assets were corporate stock and bonds, and another 21% were mutual fund assets, fully 32% of gross estates consisted of ``business assets'' such as stock in closely held businesses, interests in non-corporate businesses and farms, and interests in limited partnerships. In larger estates this portion rose to 55%.Clearly, a substantial portion of taxable estates consists of family businesses.The recent tax bill increased the estate tax exemption from $600,000 to $1 million. However, this is done very gradually and does not reach the $1 million level until 2006. The bill also increased the exemption amount for a qualified family owned business to $1.3 million. While both actions are a good first step, they barely compensate for the effects of inflation. The $600,000 exemption level was last set in 1987, just to keep pace with inflation the exemption should have risen to $850,000 by 1997.Incremental improvements help, but we need more substantial reform. It is time to eliminate this tax entirely. This action has been taken in countries such as Australia and Canada. Unfortunately, the United States retains what are arguably the highest estate taxes in the world.Among industrial nations, only Japan has a higher rate than the U.S. But Japan's 70% top rate applies only to inheritance of $16 million or more. The U.S. top rate of 55% kicks in on estates of $3 million or more. France, the United Kingdom, and Ireland all have top rates of 40%, and the average top rate of OECD countries is only 29%.Repeal of the estate tax would benefit the economy. George Mason University Professor Richard Wagner estimates that within seven years of elimination of the estate tax the output of the country would be increased by $79 billion per year, resulting in up to 228,000 new jobs. Under the current system, the energy that could go into greater productivity is expended by selling off businesses, dividing resources and preparing for the absorption of an estate by the government. Those businesses that survive the estate tax often do so by purchasing expensive insurance. A 1995 Gallup survey of family firms found that 23% of the owners of companies valued at over $10 million pay $50,000 or more per year in insurance premiums on policies designed to help them pay the eventual tax bill.The same survey found that family firms estimated they had spent on average over $33,000 on lawyers, accountants and financial planners in order to prepare for the estate tax.Ironically, the estate tax is often justified on the grounds that it helps to equalize wealth. But this effect is greatly exaggerated. A 1995 study published by the Rand Corporation found that for the very wealthiest Americans, only 7.5% of their wealth is attributable to inheritance--the other 92.5% is from earnings.Mr. President, it is time to repeal this outdated tax. We must insist that no more American families lose their business because of the estate tax. We must ensure that when a family is coping with all the inevitable costs of passing a business from one generation to the next, the Federal Government is not there as an added burden. By Mr. WELLSTONE:S. 1636. A bill to provide benefits to domestic partners of Federal employees; to the Committee on Finance.Mr. President, last October, Congressman Barney Frank broke new ground when he introduced HR2761, the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act of 1997. I am here today to break ground in the Senate by introducing the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act of 1998. This bill does not introduce new benefits; it simply extends existing benefits to a previously uncovered group of employees for very little cost.Mr. President, let me take a moment to outline my bill. This bill provides benefits for same-sex domestic partners of civilian, federal employees. Partners must be living together, in a committed, intimate relationship, and responsible for each other's welfare and financial obligations. It provides access to five categories of benefits in the same way that married spouses have access: participation in retirement programs, life insurance, health insurance, compensation for work injuries, and upon the death of a government employee, the domestic partner would be deemed a spouse for the purpose of receiving benefits.This is a bill about justice, about fairness, about equity in the workplace. This bill is about saying to our gay and lesbian employees, ``We value your contribution to the workplace, and to show you we value you, we're going to protect your families, like we protect the families of married employees, by providing them with benefits.'' It is about providing the opportunity for same-sex domestic partners to provide their partners--who previously have been denied--access to such benefits as health insurance.For many people in this country, insurance benefits for their loved ones are automatic, they are expected, they are the norm. But benefits didn't start out that way. In fact, they are a relatively modern invention. Benefits in the form of compensation were created in the 1940's, essentially to increase compensation for some employees who were prohibited by law from getting pay increases. So instead of more pay, employers paid for certain products and services such as health insurance to take care of their employees and to make their businesses more attractive to potential employees. For gay men and lesbians, most of these benefits are completely inaccessible.But where is it written in stone that only married spouses and their children deserve benefits? Yes, many employers have chosen to limit benefits to married spouses and their children, but more and more, governments, universities, and private businesses have been making a different choice. Business and organizations like the San Francisco 49ers, Reader's Digest, Starbucks, Coors, Ben and Jerry's, Kodak, Disney, the Union Theological Seminary, the Episcopal Diocese of Newark, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers #18, Mattel, the Vermont Girl Scout Council, and more than 50 Fortune 500 companies have made the right choice to offer domestic partnership benefits. A more fair and equitable choice. A more humane choice.I am disappointed that domestic partnership benefits have already been offered in some cities and by some businesses since 1982 but here we are in 1998 and we're just now talking about them here in the Senate. Today there are at least 42 cities and municipalities, 12 counties, 1 state, and 342 private sector for-profit and not-for profit businesses and unions which offer domestic partner benefits. The good news, though, is that we have more than 15 years worth of employers' experiences with providing these benefits.By virtue of our vote on DOMA, we have said that same-sex couples cannot marry. But that doesn't mean that people in long-term, loving, and committed relationships don't deserve to have the opportunity to provide their loved ones with health insurance, survivor benefits, and other benefits. Domestic partnership legislation levels the playing field for same-sex partners who are not allowed to marry. This bill is aimed at correcting that inequity. Here is the story of how not having domestic partnership benefits effected one couple's lives:Anonymous: My partner and I have been together for almost six. About a year ago, he had to leave work due to a serious heart condition. Since my employer doesn't include domestic partnership benefits, we had to pay all of his expenses out of pocket. For quite some time I had to support him from my salary, or else he would have ended up on welfare. We are still scrimping and saving to try and pay off the health care expenses that should have been covered by my insurance (if we had dp benefits). Almost all of my heterosexual friends have been ``married'' less time than my partner and I and received benefits immediately after the marriage. Their relationships seem no more permanent than my own. When my partner and I have been together for fifty years, we will still not have insurance for him through my employer.Not only are domestic partnership benefits fair and just, they cost very little. Employers have found that upon implementing domestic partnership benefits, one percent of all employees--at most--actually sign up their same-sex partners for benefits. And more often, it is less than one percent. Even taking the most liberal figures, there is no legitimate reason to argue that more than 1% of our almost 300,000 federal civilian employees will enroll. And even though this is a relatively small number of employees--at most 30,000--let me tell you, these benefits are of critical importance to those who do.For example, Marieta Louise Luna is a graduate student studying in the Divinity School at Duke University. She says,I just returned home from the hospital on Thursday night from having a knee replacement made possible largely because of the fact that Kathryn is a Duke employee and I have domestic partner benefits. Guaranteed, I could not have had the surgery if I had not had domestic partner benefits. For me, it was the literal difference between walking and being handicapped for the next several years.And at a cost of less than 1% of the total benefits budget--or less--it is truly worth making this investment.Some might be afraid that domestic partnership policies could open the door to fraud with people signing up their friends in order to get health insurance.Most employers never ask for verification of a heterosexual marriage. I have never been asked to provide a marriage certificate to prove I'm married, and I doubt that many of you have either.But my bill has stringent requirements for qualifying as domestic partners. Among other requirements, partners must sign an affidavit certifying that they share responsibility for a significant measure of each other's common welfare and financial obligations. And they must show documentation to prove it--such as copies of a mortgage or lease with both names on it, copies of bank statements showing joint checking or savings accounts, copies of durable powers of attorney for property and health, or copies of wills specifying each other as the major recipients of each other's financial assets.In addition, my bill specifies serious consequences for fraud, including the possibility of disciplinary action, termination of employment, and repayment of any insurance benefits received.Finally, there are criminal statutes that provide that making false statements and defrauding the government are crimes which can result in a fine and/or imprisonment up to 5 years.The bottom line is that this bill creates serious consequences for fraud, establishes that every effort will be made to minimize fraud by those falsely claiming to be domestic and specifies that those caught will be seriously punished.Let me tell you one more story:Anonymous from Minnesota: I have had the same health care benefits package for nearly 16 years. I began family coverage when I married in 1978. Our two children were added when they were born. My ex-husband remained on my insurance policy after we divorced--at no additional cost--even though we were not legally married. I am now in a committed lesbian relationship. My partner had been teaching part-time in a private school for two years before she became eligible for health insurance through her employer. Two weeks before her insurance was to take effect she was stricken with severe abdominal pain. Though we considered ``toughing it out'' until her insurance kicked in, it became increasingly clear that she needed to be treated immediately. She had a large, twisted ovarian tumor removed. By the time of the surgery, her insurance was in place. We breathed a sigh of relief. Months later we learned that because her pain started (and was briefly treated) before her insurance began, the claim for coverage for the surgery and hospital stay were disallowed because there was a pre-existing condition exclusion in her insurance policy. We are now faced with over $5,500 (plus 12% interest per year) in medical bills. This may not seem like a lot of money to some people, but it certainly is to us. And it's money that wouldn't have had to be spent at all if she had been on my family coverage all along. So why is it that my ex-husband (no legal relation) was entitled to continue receiving benefits until he married, but my life partner has had to go without medical insurance? The answer is simple--discrimination.This is a bill about fairness. This is about equity in the workplace. This is about protecting employees' loved ones. It's the right thing to do.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Additional Stories Regarding Domestic Partnership BenefitsAdditional Stories Regarding Domestic Partnership Benefits Wendy I. Horowitz: My partner was ill for almost a year. I worked for a large conservative company that never considered implementing domestic partner benefits. After seeing one of my co-workers get married and have instant coverage for her husband (after they had been married for a day), I decided to apply for benefits for my partner. They were denied. Her illnesses were related to her tonsils, and the doctors suggested that she have them removed. I had to come up with the money to pay for this surgery (over $4,000 by the end of it all), which put a great financial burden on us and on our relationship. Jim and Hal: As an employee of the State of Maryland (through my graduate assistantship), I receive comprehensive health benefits. Although I could share my benefits with a married spouse, I am not able to do a thing for my partner Hal. Hal is another ``starving student''; he is in a doctoral program at American University. Unfortunately, American does not offer full health coverage to its graduate assistants, so Hal is having to make do with emergency health coverage. This has adversely affected us in two ways. First, we have to cover Hals' regular health maintenance (e.g., dental checkups) which is a strain on our already stretched budget. Second and more importantly, Hal has a heart problem for which regular appointments with a cardiologist are recommended. We are not in a position to pay specialist fees out-of-pocket; thus, we are unhappily have to settle for doctors at American University's health center. U Minnesota: R and S are their late 30's, and they have been in a committed relationship for 20 years. S is self- employed as a psychotherapist and is registered with the University as R's domestic partner. Four years ago, R gave birth to the couple's first child L. R was able to put L on her health insurance policy as a dependent. The couple incurred no additional cost or additional deductibles for L's birth or subsequent medical treatment. Three years later, S gave birth to the couple's second child M. Because the University only recognizes formal adoption (not guardianship) for direct dependent coverage, M is only listed as S's child and not R's child. Since the University's domestic partnership plan only provides medical premium reimbursement for partners and their dependents, R and S incurred significantly higher costs for M's birth than for L's birth. Specifically, the couple pays out $526 every 3 months for S and M's insurance policies which each have a $500 deductible (the University plan has no deductible and low copays for dependent care). Reimbursement from the University for this cost takes additional 3 months after the couple pays. Due to IRS regulations, which do not recognize the partners as a couple, the University's reimbursement to the employee is taxed. The end result of all the complications of this system for the couple is that they have $1,500 in outstanding debt for unreimbursed health premiums. In addition, they were charged $1,000 in deductibles plus higher copays for M's birth. They have had to take out a loan to cover these health care related expenses. Becky Liddle: I am a tenured associate professor. My domestic partner quit her job and moved here to Alabama in June of '97, as the ``trailing spouse'' in a dual career couple. We thought she would find work very quickly. But due in part to sexual orientation discrimination in hiring, she has been unable to find professional work and health benefits. She is working full-time for Kelly Services, which does not include health benefits. We brought her a 4-month hospitalization policy before she quit her job, assuming that would be more than enough time--it wasn't. She has no health insurance. We have looked at policies she could buy herself, but they are extremely expensive, and cover very little. My university will not allow me to put my domestic partner on our insurance (in fact, Blue Cross of Alabama explicitly states in its policy that ``spouse'' is limited to someone of the opposite sex). Consequently, every time she gets sick it is a crisis, and we make potentially life-threatening choices about whether she should go to the doctor. For example, she got pneumonia a few weeks ago. This is, she had all the symptoms of pneumonia, according to our Time/Life ``medical advisor--complete guide to alternative &amp; conventional treatments'' book, which has become her primary care ``physician''. The book said if it was viral she should just go to bed, but if it was bacterial it could be life threatening. It appeared from her symptoms to be viral, so we did not spend the money to go to a doctor. This time we were right. She recovered fine in about a week. Of course, if we'd been wrong, she could be dead. I think we make good decisions about how to spend our limited health-care dollars. But I ought to be able to put her on my insurance. Eva Young: I live with my partner of 10 years in Minneapolis. I have benefits through my work place. Even though the University of Minnesota offers ``domestic partnership'' benefits, these don't work for us. To be able to get pretax benefits (analogous to what a married couple get), we would have to declare my partner a dependant. This is degrading to my partner. Although I currently have a better job than she does (it pays better and is permanent), it doesn't mean we should have to declare her a dependant (with all the negative connotations that has) in order to get the benefits we are both entitled to. To add insult to injury, I am taxed at the single rate, even though I am primary breadwinner for a family of 4. I consider this an equal pay for equal work issue. Why should I get paid less than my married coworker, just because I am not legally married? Not having the same benefits that a heterosexual married couple keeps my family in poverty. My family would not be in poverty if we had the same rights as married couples do. It's that simple. This isn't something that is just for the gay couple--it also will affect a lot of children. Actually, domestic partnership will do little for the dual career gay couple, where both individual are in good jobs--it's going to make a difference for gay couples who have families, or have one partner who is uninsured. Allowing gay couples to insure their partner and partner's children through their workplace insurance could also help some individuals get off government assistance. Kirk A. Nass: My domestic partner and I have been together nearly 14 years. My partner, Michael E. Gillespie, was an attorney in Seattle when we met, now he is self-employed and runs a business in Oakland which provides physicians as expert witnesses to lawyers and insurance companies for plaintiff work. Michael's past employers never provided good medical coverage, if they provided it at all. In 1989 I finished graduate school and started a job with Chevron. Michael quit his job to move with me to the San Francisco Bay Area. Chevron provides excellent health coverage to its employees, but I was unable to cover him because domestic partners were not eligible for coverage at the time. The prospect of him having a major medical event and us not being able to pay for it bothered me for years. After starting his own business five years ago, he joined an HMO (Kaiser Permanente, No. Calif.) under an individual plan. In 1995 he was diagnosed with Type II diabetes; in 1996 he suffered a heart attack and underwent an angioplasty to open the blocked artery. Because of his HMO coverage, all of his diabetes care, his stay in intensive care, and the angioplasty were covered. He's now in excellent health. If his business failed--even if he still worked for some of his past employers--we would not have had the financial resources to pay for his cardiac care. On Jan. 1, 1998, Chevron began extending medical and dental coverage (and some other benefits) to the same and opposite sex domestic partners of employees and the partners' eligible children. The coverage Chevron provides for Michael through Kaiser is even better than what he was paying for himself at Kaiser. It's the first time since we've been together he's had full coverage and the first time I haven't had to worry. Having domestic partners benefits such as medical coverage is important to us because it makes me sure that the most important person in my life can be taken care of when he needs to be. The experiences we've gone through together, although they've led to successful conclusions, have shown too often that ``what-if'' scenarios can be all too real. Dan Ross: My partner of 5 years has cerebral palsy (a congenital condition; in his case, it creates overly-tight muscle tone). After orthopedic surgery to correct some aspects of his gait, he had to make significant changes to his walk, and work on daily stretches, most of which require assistance. He is (and was) able to walk on his own, although now does so with a cane. He travels quite a bit for his job and works long hours, so it is difficult for us to work on this on a regular schedule. He can't take a leave of absence form his job, or even temporarily resign, to work on physical therapy full-time, because he absolutely needs his health insurance and he is afraid of jeopardizing that. (Some insurance plans even make cerebral palsy a ``pre-existing condition''.) My health insurance won't cover him, of course, and until recently, I wouldn't have been able to take sick leave to stay with him in the hospital and at home. He was bedridden for a total of two weeks after the surgery. As it was, I hurried back and forth between work and home, because I had just begun a new job, and didn't want to make a bad impression there; but he had scheduled the surgery for around Christmas, so there were many people off on vacation time during that period. The issue of domestic partnership benefits--whether equity in providing health insurance, or even just uniform treatment in granting sick/caregiving and bereavement leave--is important to us as a result. Pam Herman-Milmoe: I am a federal employee and Sara has just finished her Masters Degree in Clinical Psychology. While she was in school she had access to limited benefits, but now that she is job hunting she is completely uninsured. She is working in a paid internship position that is providing great experience and a real service to the community, but no benefits. As she moves on in her career she would like to establish her own practice, but if she does she'll have to pay for her own benefits without any support. The practice of denying benefits to domestic partners puts us at a severe economic disadvantage compared with my coworkers. They can use the money their spouses save on benefits for investments and other purposes. Sara and I plan on having children, who will be covered by my benefits, but money that would support their education and upbringing will have to go to pay for benefits for Sara. Steve Crutchfield: A year ago, my partner of 22 years was fired from his job. When he lost his job, he lost his health insurance benefits. He was able to maintain benefit through a COBRA plan, but it cost us an additional $150 per month to maintain his health benefits. Now that his COBRA benefits are expiring, he has to buy individual medical insurance at a cost of over $300 month. If we had a domestic partner benefits law in place, I could have put him under my insurance benefits as the spouse of a Federal Government Worker. However, since our relationship is not recognized as a marriage, I am unable to enjoy the medical insurance benefits accorded to my colleagues who are in traditional marriages. David Perkins: My partner of fifteen years came with me to Champaign-Urbana, Illinois in order that I might take a job. We have been here over three years and he has not been able to find anything other than part-time work that offers no benefits. Because the state or the University does not extend benefits to same-sex partners, he is without any health benefits whatsoever--and as he will soon turn forty-five years old, health insurance is too expensive for us to pay out-of-pocket. If anything, should happen to him--it will either completely wipe me out financially, or he will be thrown on the mercy of the taxpayers as an indigent case. Not a dramatic story, true--but a fear we live with daily. Anonymous: My partner and I have 3 children ages 15, 13 and 3. I gave birth to the first 2 before getting together with her. The youngest one we had together. Shortly after the arrival of our youngest, the opportunity arrived that I could stay home and care for her instead of putting her in day care. But in quitting my job I also had to give up my health care benefits. My partner's company does not offer domestic benefits so I am not covered for my asthma medication that I need to breath. I also am a high risk for breast cancer due to family history (mother, grandmother and 3 sisters) but I agreed to stay home for the benefit of all our children. Anon: My (same-sex) partner moved in with me in Pennsylvania two years ago. She had been self-employed (a clinical psychologist with a private practice) in CO. We are/ have been in a long-term committed relationship for three years. She had been paying her own health insurance, but since she gave up her income to move here, she had no way of continuing to pay it. My employer (a college) has a subsidized health insurance benefit for married couples only; if we had been married, the additional coverage would have cost $60. Instead, I had to pay $175 monthly so that she would have less adequate health insurance than I have. Since she needed surgery within months of moving here, with a long recovery period, she also could not earn money to help with expenses. We had to spend money on a lawyer to get documents assuring the hospital that I (an ``unrelated'' person) could make decisions for her were she to be incapacitated, etc. Furthermore, she could not avail herself of the physical recreational facilities at the college since she was not a bona fide spouse. I had to pay a membership fee for her to join a ``Y'' so she could use the physical exercise equipment she needed to recover from her surgery. All in all, not having our partnership recognized has cost me a bundle. Mindy Kurzer: My partner Linda and I have been in a committed relationship for 7 years and have a 2 year old daughter named Della. I was very pleased when the University of Minnesota instituted a domestic partner policy about 3 years ago. This policy has helped our family, because Linda is self-employed and previously carried only catastrophic coverage with lots of exclusions for pre-existing conditions. Since the U of M started this policy, we have been able to purchase a very comprehensive medical policy for her. This has turned out to be extremely important, because she was in a car accident 2 years ago, and sustained serious injuries for which she underwent two surgeries and still requires medical treatment. With her current health insurance, we have been able to get her excellent care--without it, I doubt we would have been able to do so. Domestic partner benefits are important to our community, but I think they are also important to the broader society. I have had numerous opportunities to leave the University of Minnesota and have chosen to stay here in part because the University has shown a commitment to reducing discrimination. As more and more businesses and Universities institute domestic partner benefits, institutions that do not (including the government) may be disadvantaged when it comes to getting and retaining top-notch employees. Sibley Bacon: I work for Peoplesoft, Inc. who provides domestic partner benefits to same sex couples. My partner, and I have been together for 4 years * * * she is self- employed, so we opted to have her covered through Peoplesoft. This year she developed a 5.5 cm dermoid tumor on one of her ovaries which was causing her a great deal of pain on a daily basis. Our health insurance paid for the surgery and follow up visits. This would have cost us thousands of dollars had we not had the coverage through Peoplesoft. Additionally she's been able to see a physical therapist to address some old gymnastics injuries. Needless to say, I am eternally grateful that my company provides these benefits to its gay and lesbian employees. Domestic partner coverage will certainly be a deciding factor in the future if I ever end up looking for a job outside of Peoplesoft. Toni A.H. McNaron: My partner, and I have been in a committed relationship for almost 20 years (our anniversary is in June). We own a large home in south Mpls., pay lots of property taxes, earn well over $100,000 a year, and are the first people in our neighborhood to shovel our walks in winter. One of our very nice heterosexual neighbors just married his girlfriend and sometimes doesn't shovel until the next day. The moment he and she signed the marriage license, she had his full health coverage and retirement plan benefits from his quite successful legal coverage and retirement plan benefits from his quite successful legal practice. My partner has never had a PENNY of coverage during the 34 years I've worked as a professor at the University of Minnesota. And, even more unfair, if I were killed by a drunk on the freeway on the way home tonight, she would not even get a condolence letter from the University. Instead she would get a check for the ENTIRE amount of my retirement--considerable after 34 years. Furthermore, she would have to pay the federal government approximately $90,000 at tax time because of her ``windfall.'' (How amazing to consider it a windfall to have your beloved partner of 20 years killed.) My neighbor's wife would get a condolence letter from his firm explaining to her her options for collecting his retirement funds. She is smart and would choose to have them delayed until she is older and then to have them parceled out over time so that she would pay next to no taxes on them. Nancy: I am in Texas on internship. Rose, my partner, is back home in Minnesota. Rose has fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndrome and a number of other health problems. She is in the process of leaving her job and applying for disability. Partly because of her health problems, we would like to relocate permanently to Texas. However, it will take several months for her disability claim to be processed so she can get on Medicare. She can continue her insurance coverage under COBRA, but that would only be good in Minnesota, since her coverage is with a local HMO. I can't put her on my insurance due to lack of domestic partner benefits. So we're faced with a number of unattractive options: (1) I could look for a job in Minnesota, even though both of us would rather move south and that move would be good for Rose's health. (2) She could move here and be without insurance coverage for her multiple health problems until she is approved for disability. (3) We could prolong our geographic separation and have the expense of maintaining separate households until she gets on disability, which can be a very long process. I think this is typical of the difficult choices gay and lesbian couples are forced to make without domestic partner benefits. Julie Ford: My name is Julie Ford, I am the Director of News and Public Affairs for a television station in Sarasota, Florida. My partner is Vicky Oslance, who is a surgical technician by trade but who has chosen to work per diem instead of full time in order to maintain our household since my full time job is very demanding and time consuming. Working per diem, she of course has given up health benefits. This is an added expense for us, one that the other married department heads at my workplace do not have to deal with. I an my partner have been together nearly 9 years . . . longer than most of the married people I work with. We maintain a joint checking account, stock portfolio, and own property together. It is totally unfair for me to have to pay an outrageous amount to insure Vicky's health when other married people at my workplace can get inexpensive company health insurance for their spouses. Susan Hagstrom. When I was hired by UC Berkeley five year ago, I was struck by the lack of equal compensation for equal work. What I did not know then was how close to home this inequality would hit. I recall vividly the day Debra, my partner of seven years, suffered an excruciating ruptured disk. I cried as I watched her in so much pain that she could not stand, sit, or work and had to literally crawl to the bathroom. I cried when she refused to get an MRI because we couldn't afford the $1000 procedure or the expensive doctor visits. I cannot fully describe to you how difficult this lack of benefits has been for me and for Debra. Lori Stone: Until recently, my partner had a job that provided a much inferior benefit plan to my own. Because the deductible on her plan was so high, she would often elect not to get treated for illness, preferring just to ``ride it out.'' Of course this was a risky way to go, and it back- fired on us, when she came down with kidney stones, and was eventually hospitalized. The physical trauma plus the debts we have incurred, because I was unable to cover my partner's expenses, have been difficult to surmount. I currently work for an organization that has excellent medical benefits but no provision for me to be able to cover my partner's medical expenses. If I had been able to cover my partner under my plan, I believe we wouldn't be in the unfortunate financial situation that we are today. Thanks so much for taking this bold move. I pray for the day when I won't feel so disenfranchised in my own country.",

    "text": "Mr. President, first of all, I thank the majority leader for giving me an opportunity to participate more fully in this legislative process and for his profound concern for the people of Colorado. The majority leader has been especially sensitive to this tragedy as it affected the students, parents, teachers, administrators and the support staff at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. I appreciate his willingness, along with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to work with me on possible solutions in the youth violence bill. There will be proposals to try and prevent future tragedies of this nature in our Nation's schools. There will be those who will try and take advantage of this tragedy for their own personal gain. Sadly, in some cases, some people have already sought to gain from this horror.There will be those who will want to completely ignore the problem believing that it will go away on its own. There will be those who share the views of many editorial writers in Colorado that this is a very complicated issue and that no simple solutions are going to be forth coming. These writers echo my views that only a comprehensive examination of all the contributing factors will yield smart, effective policy.The natural reaction is to seek simple solutions by laying blame. Was it inadequate laws? Inadequate enforcement? Do we blame parents, teachers, students themselves, administrators, politicians, organizations, the entertainment industry, churches, or the whole of society? Do we blame the Constitution of the United States?We need to put all this finger pointing aside and realize that we didn't come to this point overnight, that no one-thing is culpable, and that finding sensible solutions will take some time. Now is the time to concentrate and focus on what can be done about the emerging violence we are seeing in our schools. This is the time for us to look for responsible solutions. Now is the time to try and come up with common sense solutions that will make schools more safe.The Constitution of the United States is one of civilization's greatest documents. It has served magnificently as the basic governor of this nation, the world's greatest nation, as it has developed and thrived for over 200 years. The Constitution continues to serve us well and will serve us well as we go through dramatic change in the future.It is the bedrock and the foundation that moves us through national crises while preserving individual freedom. It empowers and checks the government in thoughtful, humble, and timeless language. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly examine the Bill of Rights in the context of today's world and in light of the recent shootings in our schools.During the most recent violent school crisis in Colorado and previously in Oregon, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Mississippi, we are suffered the sense of loss, pain, anger, and frustration from each event. We collectively witnessed the anguish of students, teachers, parents, administrators, and law enforcement through an intense and at time intrusive news media invasion. The wide and dramatic coverage of these events often inspires copycat crimes. But we do not throw out the first amendment.We have seen what happens in societies where there is no freedom of the press. We have witnessed the danger of censorship and government control of the media most recently in Iraq and Yugoslavia; ruthless dictators shut off the free flow of information to strengthen their grip on people who don't enjoy the benefits of a free press! Yes, some who report the news can be insensitive, irritating and down-right rude, but the alternative is far worse. Most news reporting is responsible.It seems as though we re flooded in today's world with acts of violence from guns, knives, and bombs. Anger wells-up inside us as we read and witness such senseless acts of violence, especially in our schools which are supposed to be safe havens for learning. There are many responsible, law-abiding Americans who own and use firearms today.We have witnessed many cases where ruthless dictators have moved early in their reign to disarm their soon-to-be victims. Yes, of the 270 million people in this country there are a few who are a menace to society with the guns that they own, but we cannot forget the many responsible gun owners in the United States. Guns have sporting uses, but they also save lives. Let us not forget that guns have been used to protect people, and they will continue to do so in the future.The third amendment to the Constitution talks about the excesses of the military in terms of the home. It recognizes the right of the citizen to have his own home and to have it as his sanctuary free from any soldier claiming a greater right than the citizen. In times of civil crisis we occasionally see the military used to ensure safety.Most soldiers are dedicated and trustworthy servants of this country and it is only on the rare occasion that one is not. Throughout these crises in our schools we have seen a highly charged and emotional police force move to secure the area and conduct an investigation. People are calling for quick action, looking for people to blame, and being critical of every move. The fourth amendment protects students, teachers, administrators, and parents from unfounded accusations and unwarranted seizures. It protects them from the crafty criminal who may want to shift the focus and action to an innocent party. One does not have to look far to see that people in parts of Central America, Iraq, and Yugoslavia do not have this right. During these times of crisis in our schools, people in and around these institutions are protected by due process of law.They cannot be deprived of their life, liberty, and property without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation. Some Americans want to disregard these provisions in a time of crisis. There are those who demand immediate resolution regardless of cost, but here we see the grandeur of the fifth amendment as it protects people from whims and the heat of a crisis.In any time of urgent need or catastrophe, the innocent may fall victim to false accusations. This is particularly obvious when elected officials are trying to show the electorate that they can produce results. We have seen the innocent accused and then exonerated by the justice system in cases of violence in our schools, and for this we owe the sixth amendment to our Constitution.During these troubling times in our schools there are claims of injury placed against those who have had a public responsibility. The vast majority of our public servants are good decent Americans who work to serve other people. There are a few, for one reason or another, who fail to carry out their responsibilities. The method for redress in these sad circumstances is provided in the seventh amendment.In responding to the horrific events in our schools the justice system is required to balance bail and punishment with the crime committed. The eighth amendment provides for this process to be fair and judicious.And what of rights not clearly enumerated in the Constitution? The ninth amendment expressly states that as sweeping and dedicated to liberty as the document is, it cannot provide for all freedoms. The ninth amendment allows for the protection of rights not clearly defined by the Constitution indicating a wisdom that we embrace as we approach any crisis.The 10th amendment prevents the Federal Government in times of crisis from ignoring the role of the States. Our forefathers feared most of all not the military but a national police force. The individual states were given the basic responsibilities of law enforcement, and in times of school crisis we have witnessed the effectiveness of this provision. We have also witnessed through our history many nations terrorized by a national police force. In these cases isn't an armed citizenry capable of defending itself the preferred but not perfect solution?My purpose for reviewing these vital amendments to our Constitution, this grand Bill of Rights, is to illustrate that in times of crisis, these rights are the layers of a foundation of liberty on which we live. This bedrock is the sacred strength of our nation. It is the bedrock that supports our churches, our homes, our businesses, and our schools. A natural tendency in times of crisis is to drive wedges into this bedrock in search of a solution. It is my hope that we conduct this debate upon the bedrock, and not within it.I hope during this debate we keep in mind that we do not have the power to eliminate all violence in all schools. We must strive to restore a safe environment for learning within the bounds of individual freedom. A few must not be allowed to destroy that which the American people have prospered and come to appreciate over several centuries. Common sense and sensitivity must prevail.In that light I believe there are things we can do to address school violence. There are no simple solutions and it will not happen overnight but I believe we can begin to move down that road by improving the safety in our schools. Even though schools will be our focus, the problems we face go far beyond the walls of any school, any community, any state, or for that matter any country. The laws we pass will have far reaching effects on numerous aspects of our society. I look forward to proceeding through this legislative agenda in a thoughtful manner, mindful of our sacred responsibility to the bedrock of our nation--the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.I was recently given the honor and privilege of chairing a task force on Youth Violence. This task force, composed of twelve Senators, has thoughtfully deliberated over the problem of youth violence for the past two weeks. Our efforts are, in part, a response to the recent tragedies seen in our nation's schools. We support S. 254, the Juvenile Justice bill, and the efforts of Chairman Hatch and his committee who have labored for the past several years to draft careful reforms that will positively impact our juvenile justice system. In addition, we have come to a consensus on several themes which affect juvenile crime, education and our culture. This package of legislative proposals applies reasonable reforms which we hope will enhance the work of Senator Hatch and his committee.The consensus of themes our task force will be working toward this week are:Stengthening prevention and enforcement assistance to State and local government. This is the first step in a plan which infuses funds to State and local authorities to combat juvenile crime. The Federal government will assist states best by providing flexible block grants. Our plan includes juvenile crime grants; improving our management of juvenile crime records; targeted prevention funding; a plan for graduated sanctions which begin early--when the first signs of delinquent or antisocial behavior appear, and alternative education opportunities for at-risk or problem juveniles.Another point is pushing back the influence of cultural violence by empowering parents and encouraging the public to be socially responsible. Our second step is to help our culture do more to limit the exposure of America's children to harmful and violent entertainment. Following the recent tragedy in my state, it seems clear that our culture's fascination with violence played some role in the thoughts and motivations of the cruel perpetrators of the crimes in Littleton. This includes enacting an entertainment industry code of conduct that allows for further development and enforcement of rating systems to limit exposure to children of material that the industry itself has deemed inappropriate for children. We include a plan to investigate the marketing practices of the entertainment industry where children are concerned. This plan also includes empowering Internet service providers to offer screening and filtering software that is designed to empower parents to limit access to material unsuitable for children. Our package also includes a plan to prohibit the posting of bomb making instructions on the Internet.Last, I am offering two amendments which liberate students and faculty to hold memorial services or to construct a memorial on school property in the aftermath of a tragedy.I will conclude my statement today with remarks on these amendments. The final theme of our package reinforces the theme that it is time to get tough on violent juveniles and firearms used by criminals. The Republican plan makes it more difficult for a juvenile to gain access to a firearm and insures that violent juveniles--teenagers who commit violent crimes--will be held accountable for their actions. We do this by ensuring the prosecution of those who abuse existing firearms laws. This means directing the Department of Justice to make firearms prosecutions a priority--something they have not been so far. We address gun show safety and firearms background checks, juvenile firearms possession, and penalties for firearms offenses across the board. We increase the penalty for theft of a firearm and we increase the mandatory minimum sentences for those who corrupt youth by selling them or encouraging them to sell drugs.We also address safe and secure schools. Republicans want all children to receive a quality education. This experience should be a safe one. We propose numerous options for schools to use federal funds for better teacher training regarding violent students and school security. We provide for mandatory school discipline records disclosure for transferring students; we allow for all schools the opportunity to institute address code or school uniform policy; and we free up teachers and school administrators to adequately discipline students while at the same time giving them limited liability protection. Our bill establishes a national center to boost school security efforts and creates a national award for children with character.In proposing this package, we do not pretend to believe our legislative actions will erase the harm already inflicted on too many Americans. Nor do we believe these laws will guard against all future threats of youth violence. But I do believe that the Congress has an opportunity today to strengthen and enhance our existing laws to empower families and communities to take action against this cultural virus seen in our youth.Our responsibility is to apply reason and temperance to the decisions we make this week, holding close the dearly held principles of life and liberty which are expressed in our Bill of Rights. I am hopeful that the Senate will work together to accomplish this objective.I would like to say a few words regarding my proposed amendments that will be before the Senate the first part of this next week. In the aftermath of the Littleton tragedy, I propose these amendments which will allow Congress to go on record with respect to the constitutionality of a permanent memorial or a memorial service that contains religious speech. Of course, the Allard amendments do not put Congress on record with respect to the kind of memorial that would be appropriate--that decision is for local schools and communities. The Allard amendments do, however, declare that a fitting memorial may contain religious speech without violating the Constitution.As you approach Arlington National Cemetery, signs are posted which say:Welcome to Arlington National Cemetery, Our Nation's Most Sacred Shrine. Please Conduct Yourselves with Dignity and Respect at All Times. Please Remember these are Hallowed Grounds.Similarly, Congress appropriates the funds to pay for chaplains who conduct memorial services not only at Arlington Cemetery but wherever they are needed to serve our departed men and women of the Armed Forces and their families. We recognize that paying for chaplains to conduct memorial services is not an establishment of religion by the Government, but a dignified and proper Government function. The Supreme Court has noted that the chaplaincies of the various branches of the service are constitutional. Likewise, no one could seriously contend that the signs identifying Arlington Cemetery as a sacred shrine and hallowed ground are establishments of religion.So today I am offering an amendment which states that it is fitting and proper for a school to hold a memorial service when a student or teacher is killed on school grounds. And it is fitting and proper to include religious references, songs, and readings in such a service. Memorial services help the grieving process of students and faculty, bring a school together in the face of tragedy, and meet a need deeply felt by so many to see their friend given recognition in a dignified and solemn manner. My amendment allows students and faculty of a public school to hold a memorial service that includes prayer, reading of scripture, or the performance of religious music at a memorial service that is held on the campus of a public school in order to honor the memory of any person slain on that campus.As a part of my proposed amendment there is a section that allows for the construction of a memorial that includes religious symbols or reference to God on school property. In either case, if a lawsuit is brought forth, parties are required to pay their own fees and costs and the Attorney General is authorized to provide legal assistance to defenders.This is not the equivalent of a daily school prayer. A memorial service is a very specific response to an unusual circumstance, a circumstance I hope we will not have to revisit again. The amendments specifically mention that religious songs may be sung at such memorials without violating the Constitution. The two federal appeals courts that have taken up this issue both have ruled that school choirs may sing religious music. And the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that it was constitutional for a public high school choir to have ``The Lord Bless You and Keep You'' as its signature song.In the same way, erecting a memorial that contained religious references, such as a quote from scripture, or a religious symbol from the deceased's religious tradition, would not violate the establishment clause of the Constitution.In any community visited by such a tragedy, a person who views such a memorial with religious symbols or references that were important to the deceased would certainly not see some sort of covert attempt to establish an official religion. Rather, they would see a fitting and proper memorial to a departed friend.I urge my colleagues to support my modest proposal. This legislation does two things. It requires that if a school holds memorial services or puts up a memorial in response to a killing on school grounds, and the school is sued, then all parties will bear their own costs and attorneys fees. A school that has experienced a tragedy of this kind should not have to worry about someone bringing a suit and winning thousands and thousands of dollars in attorney fee awards just because the school decides to hold a memorial service or put up a memorial. Second, this legislation permits--but does not require--the Attorney General to aid a school in defending against these suits.This is one small thing we can do to help our schools respond in a humane, compassionate, and constitutional way to the violence that has become far too common in our schools. If the people of Colorado believe that religious speech is necessary to memorialize the heroism and tragedy at Columbine High School, then let them express themselves with the most profound and durable expressions of the human heart. Let us adopt this amendment today, hoping an occasion for its use may never happen again.I yield the floor.",

    "title": "PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 1999",
    "text": "Mr. President, in the 1970s, the State of Colorado adopted a well-child care law, legislation concerning the treatment of alcoholism and mental health, as well as legislation concerning insurance coverage of psychologists. In the 1980s home health care, hospice care, and mammography screening legislation was passed into law. In the 1990s, those who represent the people of Colorado in the State House saw fit to pass laws concerning the coverage of nurses, nurse midwives, nurse anesthetists, nurse practitioners, psychiatric nurses, the continuation of coverage for dependents and employees, and conversion to non-group health care.This decade the Colorado Legislature also passed consumer grievance procedures, children's dental anesthesia and general dental provisions, direct access to OB-GYN, direct access to midwives for OB-GYN, emergency room services legislation, a ban on gag clauses, prostate cancer screening, breast reconstruction, maternity stay, and mental health parity legislation. Last, but certainly not least, among State laws enacted in my home State is a law concerning independent external appeals for patients and a comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights, passed in I am proud to have served in the Colorado State Senate, and I am proud to say that today I represent a state that has been responsive and aggressive in addressing health care issues and patients' rights.At the same time, Mr. President, I am deeply troubled that there are those in this body who are advocates of Senator Kennedy's Patients' Bill of Rights that would preempt a number of the laws that I just mentioned in the State of Colorado. In this country of 260 million Americans throughout the fifty states I believe that the people of those States are in the best position to make these specific decisions. I come from our nation's 8th largest State with a population of just 3.9 million people. I will not assume that any federal entity is more prepared to develop policy for Colorado than the people of Colorado, nor would I impose the policies unique to Colorado's needs on another State.Something I find equally troubling is that in addition to infringing on the laws of the State of Colorado, the legislation that Senator Kennedy and the Democrats have developed has the potential to increase health care costs, deprive 1.9 million Americans of health insurance who are currently covered, and cast heavy mandates down on individual states who are in a far better position to make these decisions for themselves.I will speak today about a number of things I believe will enhance the quality of health care, increase access to care, and provide important protections for patients without unnecessarily placing mandates on individual states. These provisions are all part of a comprehensive package called the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, which I feel properly addresses the needs of America's patients, physicians and health care providers.The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act establishes consumer protection standards for self-funded plans currently governed by the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act (ERISA). 48 million Americans are currently covered by plans governed by ERISA--these are American health care consumers who are not under the jurisdiction of state laws.Our bill would eliminate gag rule clauses in providers' contracts and ensure that patients have access to specialty care. The legislation also requires that health plans that use formularies to provide prescription medications ensure the participation of doctors and pharmacists in the construction of the formulary. Further addressing patient choice and access, health plans would be required to allow women direct access to obstetricians and gynecologists, and direct access to pediatricians for children, without referrals from general practitioners.These provisions are important steps in removing barriers that may prevent patients covered under ERISA from receiving necessary and proper treatment in a timely manner.As a former small business owner I have a keen understanding of the issues that confront the self-employed. I also have experience in balancing the wages and benefits you extend to an employee with a healthy bottom line. I think it is important that we remember throughout the course of this debate that employers provide health care benefits as a voluntary form of compensation for their employees. We must be wary of legislation that will increase costs and liability for employers in a way that may reduce the quality and scope of benefit packages for employees.Our bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, would make health insurance deductible for the self-employed and increase the availability of medical savings accounts. I believe that each of these provisions would give greater power to the individual and make private insurance more affordable for families and individuals. Large corporations can claim a 100 percent deduction for health care and small business should be treated the same.Medical savings accounts, otherwise known as MSAs, combine a high deductible and low cost catastrophic policy with tax free savings that can be used for routine medical expenses. We should increase the availability to all families who desire MSAs. These efforts will prove particularly helpful to those individuals working for small business, and those in transition from one job to another since MSAs are fully portable.I want to stress that our legislation will not mandate these accounts for everyone, but will simply establish the accounts as an option to those who feel they will be best served by MSAs. I believe that medical savings accounts are particularly important for uninsured, lower income Americans. Allowing consumers to pay for medical expenses through these affordable tax-deductible plans, tailored to their needs, is a viable free-market approach to decreasing the number of uninsured in America. This is a question of providing greater choice for health care consumers.The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act would also permit the carryover of unused benefits from flexible spending accounts, again increasing the number of options available to the consumers of health care.In keeping with presenting more options to the consumer, The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act includes language that would require all group health plans to provide a wide range of comparative information about the health coverage they provide. This information would include descriptions of health insurance coverage and the networks who provide care so that consumers covered by self insured and fully insured group health plans can make the best decisions based on their needs and preferences.One of the most contentious issues in health care has been the issue of malpractice liability, grievance procedures and the mechanism for the appeal of decisions made by managed care companies. My colleagues across the aisle are interested in taking the grievance procedure into a court of law, allowing a patient greater access to litigation as a means of challenging a managed care organization's decision.Lawsuits and the increased threat of litigation will demand that more money to be funneled into non-medical administration and away from what patients really want--quality health care. Furthermore, making the courts a de facto arbiter of health care decisions seems to me to be less efficient and less effective in dealing with the interests of the patient. The Kennedy bill is an enormous gift for the trial lawyers in America who stand to profit by high cost, long-term cases. Patients, not lawyers, will fare far better under the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus.I am also concerned that expanding medical malpractice liability will lead to more defensive medical decisions regardless of the merit of a particular treatment. High liability exposure and cost has driven countless physicians from their profession for years, particularly in high-need rural areas.This is not a provision we can afford in rural areas of western States like Colorado that are already under-served.Rather than take health care out of the doctor's office and into the courts, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act establishes strict time frames for internal and external appeals for the 124 million Americans who receive care from self insured and fully insured group plans. Routine requests would need to be completed within 30 days, or 72 hours in specific cases when a delay would be detrimental to the patient. Rather than use the courts in cases of health care appeals our legislation would establish a system of independent, internal and external review by physicians with appropriate expertise. We are talking about doctors with years of experience and medical training making health care decisions, not legal arguments.I believe that such a system will be more responsive and more tailored to the needs of every individual patient--and it will do so without creating unnecessary bureaucracy. It is also important to note that these internal and external appeals will cost patients and employers considerably less than the alternative proposal that is heavy on lawsuits, lawyers and litigation.Another area of concern that I believe needs to be incorporated in any sensible managed care reform legislation is the inclusion of protections for patients from genetic discrimination. The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act would prohibit all group health plans and insurers from denying coverage or adjusting premiums based on predictive genetic information. The protected genetic information includes an individual's genetic tests, genetic tests of family members, or information about the medical history of family members.No one should live in fear of being without health care based on genetic traits that may not develop into a health problem.Mr. President, I believe these provisions will empower the individual, not the lawyers or bureaucracies. I am committed to the notion that each individual American consumer of health care is in the best position to chose where his or her health care dollar is best spent.An administrative issue involved in this debate that I am very concerned with is the effort to attempt to force all health plans--not just HMOs--to report the medical outcomes of their subscribers and the physicians who treat them. This makes sense for a managed care plan such as an HMO, but it would be virtually impossible for a PPO or indemnity plan to monitor and classify this data without becoming involved in individual medical cases.I believe that if we require all health plans to collect and report data like this we will be requiring all plans to be organized like an HMO. This would significantly reduce the number of choices consumers and employers currently enjoy in selecting their health care.The Congressional Budget Office recently determined that if S. 6, the Kennedy version of the Patients' Bill of Rights, were to pass that this country would see private health insurance premiums increase 6.1 percent above inflation. What appears to be a minor increase to health care premiums would have disastrous and immediate consequences around the country, adding 1.9 million Americans to the ranks of the uninsured. In my home state that translates to 32,384 people. In Colorado the average household would lose $203 in wages and 2,989 jobs would be lost by 2003 for this ``minor'' increase.We are talking about people in Colorado losing their jobs and their health care coverage because Washington wants to do what the State of Colorado has been working on for the last thirty years.The Congressional Budget Office determined that our bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, would increase costs by less than 1 percent. While I urge my colleagues to be wary of any potential increase in costs for the American people, I also believe that the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, and not the current Kennedy bill, directly addresses health care quality issues and increases choice for consumers with a minimal cost.",

By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Crapo):S. 3213. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow an individual to designate $3 or more on their income tax return to be used to reduce the public debt; to the Committee on Finance.Mr. President, I have introduced S. 3213. I want to take a few moments to talk about this important piece of legislation for paying down the national debt.As the 106th Congress comes to an end, I rise to make a few comments on the evolution of an issue of great concern to myself and to many Americans. The issue is the $5,661,548,045,674 national debt we had as of October 2, 2000.In August of 1993, while serving in the House of Representatives, I introduced House Joint Resolution 251 with the support of a number of my colleagues. The intention of this resolution was to amend the Constitution of the United States to provide for budgetary reform by requiring the reduction of the deficit, a balanced Federal budget, and the repayment of the national debt. During my years in the House, I had the good fortune to work with many Republican colleagues who were committed to these fiscally sound and enormously important issues.Today, a scant 7 years later, we are enjoying unsurpassed Federal budget surpluses and the many difficulties that accompany such prosperity. I am concerned that the running dialog in Washington is far too focused on today's spending, today's enormous Federal programs, today's immediate wants and needs. I am concerned that we are talking too much about spend today and not enough about the consequences of tomorrow. As we conclude the appropriations process, it is apparent that many Members of this body are eager to transform the Federal budget surplus into new Federal spending, creating more Federal programs that will begat future obligations.I am primarily concerned that efforts to recklessly spend every nickel of the taxpayers' money will threaten the long-term fiscal health of our Nation, the Nation our children and grandchildren will inherit. The majority of my colleagues on this side of the aisle are focusing on returning the surplus to its rightful owners--the American people.In recent months, the current administration has taken a hardline against tax cuts, making it clear that the President believes the Federal budget surplus belongs to Washington and not the hard-working men and women who send far more money to the Internal Revenue Service than they often save for retirement, college, or for buying a home.I find it frustrating and the height of arrogance to assume that the Federal Government can do more with this money than the taxpayers. So many of my Republican colleagues have such a profound conviction regarding returning the money to the working man and woman that, in fact, they have been hesitant to engage in development of a comprehensive long-term debt repayment plan.I have come to the floor before, and I will come to the floor again, to make clear what is required to manage the national debt in a comprehensive repayment strategy. The sheer enormity of the national debt demands such diligence. I admit that I have no desire to increase the growth of the Federal Government instead of paying down the debt. I am, as many of my colleagues, however, personally committed to cutting taxes.I have come to the floor today for no other reason than to make one thing crystal clear: We can pay down the debt and cut taxes. It is not an either/or proposition. It takes planning, and it takes commitment. It takes a plan to repay the debt and a commitment to cut taxes and the discipline to refrain from pouring ever more money into newer or larger programs.At the end of fiscal year 1999, the gross Federal budget was $5,656,270,901,615 and at the end of fiscal year 2000, the gross Federal budget was $5,674,178,209,886.Our past fiscal irresponsibilities have created this overwhelming mess, and an unpleasant task lies before us. For the health and well-being of our national economy and the future security of our young people, we must commit to the elimination of this debt.The journey of 5\\1/2\\ trillion miles begins with a single step. Early in the 106th Congress, I introduced the American Debt Repayment Act. A year later, I followed that legislation with the American Social Security Protection and Debt Repayment Act. I believe each of these bills provided a sensible first step toward debt repayment and the 5 trillion steps to follow.Both pieces of legislation suggested we treat the Federal debt just as every American treats the largest purchase they will ever make. That is their home. In February of this year, I came to the floor with my friends, George Voinovich, Rod Grams and Mike Enzi, with an amortization schedule for debt repayment to be offered to the budget resolution. Just as any American home buyer would amortize the purchase of their home with a mortgage, we offered a dutiful and moderate restriction on Federal spending combined with a specific debt repayment schedule. Our amendment was defeated. I believe the chief reason for the defeat of the amendment was the fear of being locked into a long-term repayment plan that would prohibit future tax cuts. The July 2000 budget economic and outlook update by the Congressional Budget Office disputes this understandable fear.According to the CBO, assuming spending is frozen at fiscal year 2000 levels, the next 10 years will yield an on-budget surplus of $3.4 trillion. If this Congress had exercised some discipline this year and appropriated within a freeze, the on-budget surplus in fiscal year 2001, which we have just begun, is projected to be $116 billion.One criticism of the long-term debt amortization plan that I brought to the floor was that it would prevent tax cuts and tie the hands of appropriators by absorbing all of the surplus. My most recent plan simply dedicates $15 billion of on-budget surplus to debt repayment and adds $15 billion each year thereafter. The sum total after 10 years of structured debt repayment is $825 billion from on-budget surplus.This repayment schedule would have left $2.6 trillion remaining for tax cuts and new spending over the next 10 years.It is important to note that these numbers do not take into account the off-budget surplus created by Social Security. I have said on the floor many times before that paying down the national debt is one of the best ways to provide long-term fiscal stability to Social Security.In the past, I proposed restricted use of the Social Security surplus to help pay down the debt. This not only provides for the future stability of Social Security by paying down the debt but protects Social Security money from Federal discretionary spending.Social Security surplus money should be used for debt repayment only until such time as Congress can initiate sensible reform to preserve the long-term integrity of Social Security. Social Security reform has been a priority of this Congress, and we can act to reduce the debt and reform this important program in one commitment.When the new Congress convenes in 2001, I intend to continue to work with my colleagues on developing a sensible and concrete debt repayment plan. I am also interested in working with my colleagues on other innovative ways to reduce the national debt. Legislation was recently introduced in the House, and I am pleased to come to the floor today on behalf of myself and the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Crapo, to introduce the Taxpayers Choice Debt Reduction Act.Every year, millions of taxpaying Americans have the opportunity to designate on their tax form a $3 contribution to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund. This checkoff on all 1040 forms would allow for the taxpayers themselves to designate that $3, or $6 for joint filers, would be dedicated to a special Department of the Treasury account to pay down the national debt.Checking the box on the tax document would not increase the amount of taxes to be paid, nor would it decrease any refund. Checking ``yes'' in this box would simply provide a directive from the taxpayer that 3 of the dollars they were paying in taxes be used solely to pay down the Nation's debt. Importantly, these funds would be beyond any money set aside by Congress for debt reduction.In my annual town meetings around the State of Colorado, I often speak with my constituents over the enormous debt owed by this country. I can say with great confidence that this is an issue where the public desires action. It is my hope that with this legislation Congress will empower these concerned taxpayers to act on their impulse to eliminate the debt. Mr. GREGG (for himself and Mr. Harkin):S. 3214. A bill to amend the Assets for Independence Act (Title IV of the Community Opportunities, Accountability, and Training and Educational Services Act of 1998) to enhance program flexibility, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.Mr. President, in his 1991 book ``Assets and the Poor: a New American Welfare Policy,'' Washington University Professor Michael Sherraden argues that people move forward economically through savings and investment, not through spending and consumption. Owning assets gives people a stake in the future--a reason to save, to dream, and to invest time, effort and resources in creating a future for themselves and their children. As Sherraden puts it, ``income may feed people's stomachs, but assets change their heads.''I am pleased today to be joined by Senator Harkin in introducing legislation designed to further promote innovative asset-building strategies for the poor.Over the past two years, asset-building strategies have gained widespread, bi-partisan support at both the federal and state levels. Legislation has been introduced and laws have been enacted to develop and promote Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) among low income Americans. IDAs reward the monthly savings of working poor families who are trying to buy their first home, pay for post secondary education, or start a business.In some respects, IDAs are like Individual Retirement Accounts for the working poor. IDAs are dedicated savings accounts that can be used for purchasing a first home, paying for post-secondary education, or capitalizing business. These investments are associated with extremely high rates of return that have the potential to bring a new level of economic and personal security to families and communities. Participants also are able to make emergency withdrawals in limited circumstances and must pay back such withdrawals within 12 months.The individual or family deposits whatever dollar amount they can save (typically $5 to $20 a month) into the account. The sponsoring organization matches that deposit with funds provided by local churches and service organizations, corporations, foundations, and state or local governments. The sponsoring organization determines the ratio at which they will match an individual's contribution (not less than $0.50 and not more than $4 for every $1).In 1998, Congress enacted legislation entitled the ``Assets for Independence Act''. This Act established a five year demonstration program to determine the social, civic, psychological and economic effects that individual development account, IDA, savings accounts can have on low income individuals and their families. The assets for independence demonstration program is presently the largest source of federal funding for individual development accounts.The intent of this demonstration program is to encourage participants to develop and reinforce strong habits for saving money. To assist this, sponsor organizations provide participating individuals and families intensive financial counseling and counseling to develop investment plans for education, home ownership, and entrepreneurship. In addition, participating welfare and low-income families build assets whose high return on investment has the capacity for propelling them into independence and stability. The community also benefits from the significant return on investment in IDAs: we expect welfare rolls to be reduced, tax receipts to increase, employment to increase, and local enterprises and builders can expect local businesses to benefit from increased activity. Neighborhoods will be rejuvenated as new micro-enterprises and increased home renovation and building drive increased employment and community development.In fact, it is estimated that an investment of $125 million in assert building through these individual accounts will generate 7,050 new businesses, 68,799 new jobs, $730 million in additional earnings, 12,000 new or rehabilitated homes, $287 million in savings and matching contributions and earnings on those accounts, $188 million in increased assets for low-income families, 6,600 families removed from welfare rolls, 12,000 youth graduates from vocational education and college programs, 20,000 adults obtaining high school, vocational, and college degrees.IDA programs currently exist in about 250-300 communities, with another 100 in development. Overall, at least 10,000 people are currently saving in an IDA and another 30,000-40,000 are expected to be reached by the year 2003. All but three states have IDA programs in their states or mechanisms in place to permit the start up of an IDA program.The field of economic development has rapidly changed over the course of the last few years, and as a result, those administering IDAs on a national basis have sought to work within the structure defined by Congress. Unfortunately, because of changes in the field and certain unforeseen difficulties with the implementation of the demonstration in its current form, we have been asked to consider making a handful of technical changes that will help with program administration and make the program run more consistently and effectively.Those changes include: (1) changing the legal accounting structure of IDAs; (2) expanding the potential field of grantees to include low-income credit unions and community development financial institutions; (3) providing additional flexibility for withdrawals from IDA accounts for the purchase of a home; (4) expanding the availability of funds for economic literacy training; and (5) adding a Federal poverty measure to the current eligibility criteria; and (6) making the AFIA and TANF Individual Development Account programs consistent with respect to the treatment of funds for purposes of determining eligibility for Federal programs based on need.These are modest but needed changes in the law that will help Federal IDA programs function more as originally intended. I urge their adoption.I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Assets for Independence Act Amendments of 2000--Section-by-Section NOTE: Except where otherwise specified, references in this summary to provisions of law are references to provisions of the Assets for Independence Act (the Act), title IV of the Community Opportunities, Accountability, and Training and Educational Services Act of 1998.This section amends section 404(5)(A) (which defines the term ``Individual Development Account'' (IDA) and specifies required IDA elements), in clause (v), to eliminate language which permits use of matching contributions by the qualified entity serving as IDA trustee for emergency withdrawals. As amended, clause (v) would permit use of matching contributions only for qualified expenses (as defined in section 404(8)). The amendment would eliminate the inconsistency between section 404(5)(A)(v) as currently drafted and section 404(3), which defines the term ``emergency withdrawal'' to mean a withdrawal by the eligible individual of some or all of the funds deposited by that individual for specified emergency situations.This section amends section 404(7) (the definition of ``qualified entity'') to expand the category of entities eligible to operate IDA programs under the Act to include low-income credit unions (as designated by the National Credit Union Administration) and organizations designated as community development financial institutions by the Secretary of the Treasury (or the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund) that can demonstrate a collaborative relationship with a community-based organization.Section 4(a) amends section 407(8)(B) (which includes the purchase of a first home in the definition of ``qualified expenses'' for which IDA funds can be withdrawn by the participant) to increase the purchase price limit to 120 percent of the average area purchase price for such a residence.Section 5 amends section 407(c)(3) by increasing from 9.5 percent of 15 percent the amount of funds that grantee organizations may use to provide economic literacy training and other administrative functions. Of this amount, not more than 7.5 percent may be used for administrative functions.This section amends section 408(a) (which sets forth IDA participation criteria) by adding an additional criteria for eligibility as an IDA program participant. Under this amendment, an individual with an income less than 200% of the poverty line (as defined by OMB), would be eligible to participate.Section 7 amends Section 412 &lt;Copyright&gt; which currently requires the first Annual Progress Report to be delivered not later than 60 days after the end of the calendar year. This amendment would require the first report to be delivered not later than 60 days after the end of the project year.This section amends section 414(d) which currently requires the first interim evaluation to be delivered not later than 90 days after the end of the calendar year in which the Secretary first authorizes a demonstration project. This amendment would require the first interim evaluation to be delivered not later than 90 days after the end of the project year.The section amends section 414(e) (which sets forth the amount the Secretary may set aside to evaluate the IDA program) by changing from 2% to not more than $500,000 the amount of IDA appropriations set aside for such evaluation. By Mr. HARKIN:S. 3215. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize women's health research award programs conducted through the National Institutes of Health; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Women's Health Research Career Enhancement Act of 2000. This legislation addresses a critical shortage of qualified clinician researchers available to investigate the diseases and conditions that primarily affect women.As the brother of two sisters lost to breast cancer and the father of two daughters, I know first-hand the importance of making women's health initiatives a top priority. More can and must be done to guarantee that women have the quality care they deserve. This includes making sure that qualified researchers are out there leading the search for cures and treatments.In 1985, the United States Public Health Task Force on Women's Health Issues concluded that women's health care was getting short shrift by the lack of research focus on women's health concerns. Since then we have made good progress to expand women's health research, but more needs to be done.In 1990, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) found that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) had been slow and ineffective in implementing a policy to include women in research study populations. At the urging of myself and others, and in response to passage of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993, the NIH began to take more comprehensive measures to increase research on health problems affecting women. And more recently, at my request, along with Senators Olympia Snowe and Barbara Mikulski, and Representative Harry Waxman (D-CA), the GAO published a report last May assessing the NIH's progress on conducting research on women's health in the past decade. The GAO's report found that while NIH has made significant progress in implementing a strengthened policy on including women in clinical research, they have failed to fully analyze clinical data on women's health.It is clear we can and must do more to advance a comprehensive women's health agenda.A growing body of evidence is emerging that demonstrates significant differences between men and women and how they get sick and how they react to potential treatments. Women and men metabolize food, alcohol, medication and environmental toxins differently.And certain diseases and conditions disproportionately affect women. For example, women comprise 80% of those suffering from osteoporosis. Seventy-five percent of those afflicted with autoimmune diseases are women. And although we have made significant progress, we are still fighting the terrible epidemic of breast cancer in this country, a disease that strikes 1 out of every 8 American women.Women everywhere will benefit through more and better scientific research on the diseases and conditions that affect them. And our scientific enterprise will reap maximum returns when it involves teams of investigators with expertise in various disciplines. A comprehensive, targeted approach is necessary to develop a multi-disciplinary cadre of researchers with the interest and expertise to broaden the field of women's health research.In addition, mentoring between junior and senior scientists is important to promoting an inclusive and diverse research environment. Mentoring relationships can lead to the retention and advancement of talented scientists from all segments of the population and enhance our investment in medical research.Mr. President, my legislation authorizes two important initiatives to expand the number of qualified investigators in women's health research by providing improved career development opportunities through the National Institutes of Health (NIH):First, the Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health Program--will support the career development of junior women's health scientists by providing new opportunities to improve their research skills in interdisciplinary settings. The NIH, through the Office of Research on Women's Health, will provide grants to research institutions to pair junior investigators with seasoned senior investigators, who will mentor them for 2-5 years.Second, the Women's Reproductive Health Research Career Development Centers--will help build the next generation of investigators in obstetrics and gynecology by giving clinicians the experience they need to become women's health scientists. The NIH, through the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Office of Research on Women's Health, will provide grants to research institutions and hospitals for the training of new women's health researchers.The Women's Reproductive Health Research Career Development Centers program and the Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health grant program have already stimulated women's health research across a variety of disciplines. Authorizing and expanding these programs will speed breakthroughs in women's health research by building and improving the network of scientific investigators expert in the diseases and conditions that affect women.Mr. President, I have a long tradition of supporting research and specifically women's health research both as Chairman and now Ranking Member of the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee. This year we will provide an unprecedented, $2.7 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health, keeping us well on track towards our goal of doubling the NIH budget over 5 years.But all the funding in the world will do us no good if we don't have talented investigators ready and able to take on the challenge of finding the cures and treatments for the diseases that afflict us. We must do more to make sure we grow and strengthen a diverse network of our best and brightest clinicians and scientists to keep pace with our increased investment in medical research. The bill I am introducing today will help to do just that. It has the support of the National Institutes of Health, the Society for Women's Health Research, the Women's Health Research Coalition and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,This Act may be cited as the ``Women's Health Research Career Enhancement Act of 2000''.Congress makes the following findings: (1) The Public Health Service's Task Force on Women's Health Issues concluded in 1985 that women's health care was compromised by the lack of research focus on women's health concerns. Since then, progress has been made to expand women's health research, but more can be done to strengthen our nation's capacity to aggressively investigate the diseases and conditions primarily affecting women. (2) A growing body of evidence demonstrates dramatic differences between women's and men's biology, including symptoms of disease, mechanism of disease and responses to treatment. (3) Women and men differ in disease presentation and treatment outcomes of coronary heart disease. Women comprise 80 percent of the population suffering from osteoporosis. Women comprise 75 percent of those afflicted with autoimmune diseases. Women and men metablolize food, alcohol, medication, and atmospheric toxins differently. (4) Scientific research will reap maximum returns when it involves teams of investigators with expertise in various disciplines. A comprehensive, targeted effort is necessary to develop a multi-disciplinary cadre of researchers with the interest and expertise to develop the field of gender based health research so that it has the greatest impact on all women and men. (5) Mentoring between junior and senior scientists is vitally important to promoting an inclusive and diverse research environment, leading to the retention and advancement of talented scientists from all segments of the population and enhancing the nation's investment in treatments and cures for the diseases and conditions that affect Americans. (6) The Women's Reproductive Health Research Career Development Centers and the Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health grant programs have stimulated women's health research across a variety of disciplines. (7) Expanding the initiatives described in paragraph (6) will speed breakthroughs in women's health research by building and improving the network of scientific investigators who are experts in the diseases and conditions that affect women.Part A of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:Part A of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``SEC. 310A.

    "text": "Mr. President, today I want to take a few minutes to recognize the efforts of everyone involved in the capture of the Texas fugitives that ended one of the largest manhunts this national has ever seen. As you know, the last two of the seven Texas inmates that escaped from a maximum security prison in Kenedy, Texas on December 13th surrendered on January 24th in Colorado Springs, Colorado. This can be attributed to the exemplary work done by the local and federal law enforcement agencies involved as well as the communities of Woodland Park and Colorado Springs. This was a cooperative effort that saw the pooling of all the resources available and resulted in a peaceful conclusion.There cannot be enough said about the work that was done by the law enforcement agencies involved. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, The Colorado Springs office of the Bureau of Alcohol and Firearms, the U.S. Marshals office, the Texas authorities, the Teller County Sheriffs office, the El Paso County Sheriffs office, the Colorado Springs Police Department, the Woodland Park Police Department and the Colorado State Patrol did a tremendous job of working together to apprehend the seven fugitives.The effort and support of the residents of Woodland Park and Colorado Springs can't be overlooked. We need to commend people like Wade Holder and Eric Singer. Mr. Holder resides in Woodland Park and is the owner of the RV park where the fugitives were hiding out. He called in a tip to the local authorities after seeing pictures of the fugitives on the America's Most Wanted Web Site. KKTV's Colorado Springs news anchor Eric Singer helped negotiators by conducting a telephone interview with the last two fugitives in order to assure a peaceful surrender. These are just a couple of examples of how the two communities contributed to the successful manhunt.In all of this we should not forget that two law enforcement agents lost their lives in this investigation. Irving, Texas Officer Aubrey Hawkins and Colorado State Trooper Jason Manspeaker both died in the line of duty. Officer Hawkins was brutally shot 11 times and killed by one of the fugitives while responding to a robbery of a sporting goods store in Irving Texas on December 24th. Colorado State Trooper Jason Manspeaker was killed when he crashed his Jeep Cherokee Squad car into a heavy equipment trailer on U.S. Highway 6 in Colorado. The crash occurred while chasing a vehicle suspected of harboring the last two fugitives on January 23rd. Both Officer Hawkins and State Trooper Manspeaker paid the ultimate price for our freedom. My wife Joan and I offer all our compassion, our sympathy and our prayers to the families of both victims. ",

    "title": "THE BUDGET OUTLOOK",
    "text": "Mr. President, on July 20 the senior Senator from the great State of North Dakota made a series of thought-provoking comments on the floor of the Senate. Many of those comments related to a speech Larry Lindsey, President Bush's economic advisor and a distinguished public servant, delivered in Philadelphia on July 19.In his statement my colleague alleges that Dr. Lindsey misrepresented his views on raising taxes at a time of economic slowdown. In fact, on page 12 of his speech, Dr. Lindsey said, ``In recent hearings conducted by Senator Conrad at which Budget Director Daniels testified, the Senator agreed that raising taxes this year might not be a good idea given the economy. But he went on to be clear that next year might be different. He hinted at a tax increase in 2002, just as the economy is recovering.''If, when he made his remarks on the floor of the Senate, Senator Conrad had not seen a copy of Dr. Lindsey's speech, I can well understand that he may not have realized that his allegation on the matter of his favoring a tax increase this year was false. As to Senator Conrad's views on the advisability of a tax increase next year, I must say that the transcript of his floor statement on July 20 only reinforces the view that he might support a tax increase next year when the economy is growing more robustly. Independent observers have drawn the same conclusion about Senator Conrad's views from his public statements. Robert Samuelson, in the July 11 Washington Post wrote, ``To protect on-budget surpluses, Conrad says the Bush administration has `an affirmative obligation to come up with spending cuts or new revenue (tax increases).''' If this is not the case, and Senator Conrad is opposed to tax increases next year, I can assure you that I would applaud his decision.In his Philadelphia speech, Dr. Lindsey provided compelling reasons why we should not even be talking about the possibility of raising taxes next year. First, a tax increase next year would undermine the sense of permanence associated with this year's tax cut. That sense of permanence is key to the success of this year's tax cut. Talk of increasing taxes, or of repealing the tax cut next year, thus reduces the effectiveness of this year's tax cut. Furthermore, you need only look at Japan's experience when it increased taxes early in an expansion. It wasn't pretty.A second point of concern in this dialogue involves the timing of the tax cut. I am pleased to discover the amount of agreement between the administration and Senator Conrad on the need for a fiscal stimulus this year. When he announced his tax program in December, 1999, the President said that the country may need an insurance policy. Thus, while he proposed a basic plan involving a 5-year phase-in, the President left flexible the actual timing of his tax reduction, explicitly letting it depend on macroeconomic circumstances. In January he indicated a need to work with Congress on an acceleration of the tax cut. And in his formal proposal in February, the President said explicitly, ``I want to work with you to give our economy an important jump-start by making tax relief retroactive.'' That was a full month before the distinguished senior Senator from North Dakota proposed his $60 billion tax cut proposal for this year.Fortunately, Congress did pass a fiscal stimulus for 2001. Senator Conrad's floor statement indicates support for a $60 billion tax reduction this year. That figure is very close to the $74 billion figure that actually passed and was signed into law. I don't believe that the $14 billion difference in these figures could be the basis for Senator Conrad's assertion that the administration is ``driving us into the fiscal ditch,'' especially given a $2 trillion Federal budget and the Senator's apparent support for cutting taxes during an economic slowdown.Furthermore, the spending side of the fiscal year 2001 budget was determined last fall under President Clinton. At that time, the President and the Congress increased discretionary spending by more than 8 percent. Had that rate of spending increase been sustained, we certainly would have deficit problems later this decade. Fortunately President Bush proposed a budget, and Congress adopted a budget resolution, with a sharp deceleration of that rate of spending increase.Looking forward, a comparison of the Democratic alternative that Senator Conrad referred to in his remarks and the bill that actually passed is instructive. For example, in fiscal year 2002 the bill that passed the Congress and was signed by the President was scored at $38 billion. By comparison, the Democratic alternative was scored at $64 billion. Would the Democratic alternative tax proposal have driven us into the ``fiscal ditch'' deeper and faster than the President's budget?In fiscal year 2003, the relevant scoring by Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation shows the bill that actually passed cost $91 billion while the Democratic alternative cost $83 billion. In fiscal year 2004 the figures were $108 billion for the bill that actually passed and $101 billion for the Democratic alternative. In fiscal year 2005 the actual legislation cost $107 billion while the Democratic alternative cost $115 billion. Surely this $7 billion difference between the two bills over a three year period cannot plausibly be labeled ``driving us into the fiscal ditch'' either.One must assume that Senator Conrad's assertions are based on the long-term revenue effects of the President's proposal. Yet, in fiscal year 2006 and later no one is forecasting anything but a large budget surplus. Thus, it is hard to find any factual basis for claims that the President's tax plan is ``driving us into the fiscal ditch'' by any definition of that term that does not also apply to the proposals Senator Conrad and his Democrat colleagues advanced during the budget debate.It is apparent from Senator Conrad's remarks that he and Dr. Lindsey differ on the proper measure of fiscal tightness. Dr. Lindsey asserted in his speech that the best measure of the Government's effect on the financial markets is the Unified Budget Surplus. This was a concept created by a special commission appointed by President Lyndon Johnson and has been in use for more than 30 years. It has long been the standard for non-partisan analysis of the budget. For good measure, on page fifteen of his speech, Dr. Lindsey quoted Robert Samuelson regarding the usefulness of alternative definitions.As to the appropriate size of the unified surplus, I concur wholeheartedly with the administration's view that the unified surplus should be at least as large as the Social Security surplus. Dr. Lindsey outlined in his Philadelphia speech why this is appropriate. But, Senator Conrad and Dr. Lindsey disagree fundamentally regarding the right term to apply to Medicare. As Dr. Lindsey stated in his speech, every dollar of Medicare premiums paid by beneficiaries and every dollar of Medicare taxes paid by workers and their employers is spent on Medicare. In addition, Medicare receives $50 billion in extra money from the rest of the Federal budget. Frankly, the ``surplus'' concept does not make much sense under the circumstances.In his floor speech Senator Conrad made an analogy to ``defense,'' noting that all of its funding is paid for from the rest of the Federal budget. But no one talks of a ``defense surplus.'' Indeed, the concept of a ``surplus'' in a program that requires net inflows from the rest of the budget seems to make little sense. I therefore do not see why references to the budgetary funding of defense conceivably supports the assertion that Medicare has a ``surplus.''Finally, Senator Conrad and Dr. Lindsey also seem to disagree on the extent to which the Government should control the fruits of our Nation's labor, saving, and risk-taking. Over the last 8 years, the share of GDP taken in Federal receipts has increased from 17.3 percent to 20.3 percent. Even if the President's original campaign proposal on taxes were to have been enacted, the tax share of GDP would have been rolled back only modestly, and would still have been above the post-War average. I believe that I am on firm ground stating that Senator Conrad's opposition to even this modest rollback means that he supports something close to the current record-setting tax take.As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I urge my colleagues to consider these facts as they consider the appropriate course for fiscal policy in the months and years ahead.",

    "text": "After the Persian Gulf conflict, the international community levied economic sanctions and established the ``Oil for Food'' program. However, these sanctions have largely eroded due to the lack of resolve by the international community and the reality of Iraq's substantial illicit trade. Turkey and Jordan import Iraqi oil via truck routes, Iran escorts oil tankers through territorial waters, an Iraq-Syrian pipeline is the largest export method of Iraqi oil, with an Iraq-Jordan pipeline scheduled to be operational in 2005.The United States attempted to garner support for ``Smart Sanctions'' in early 2001, but this attempt met tepid reception by the international community. Russia, China, and France have negotiated substantial contracts with Iraq which would be executable upon lifting of U.N. sanctions. Under the Oil for Food program, food import levels exceed and oil revenue is comparable to pre-Gulf war levels. The program experiences periodic progressive adjustments in its export ceiling in response to growing international concern about the Iraqi humanitarian condition.However, Saddam Hussein consistently circumvent's the economic sanctions and attempts to thwart the oil for food program. Saddam's regime has exported thousands of barrels of oil each day in violation of UN resolutions and he completely disregards the humanitarian well-being of his own people. By illegally exporting this oil, he has deprived the Iraqi people billions of dollars in food and medicine which would have been allowed under the program.The living conditions of the Iraqi people are intolerable. Saddam Hussein has expanded his violence against women and children, withheld food and medicine from his own citizens, and violated the basic human rights of the Iraqi people.Mr. President, some have blamed the oil for food program and the economic sanctions for these conditions. But let us be very clear, the reason for these intolerable conditions and why we are debating this topic today lay at the feet of Saddam Hussein and his regime. To quote Secretary of State Powell from a Foreign Relations Committee hearing on September 26, ``Iraq stands guilty. It convicts itself by its actions.''The threat of Saddam Hussein is real and is growing. Iraq enjoys a sizable military advantage over all Gulf States except Iran. Iraq's 424,000 military personnel outnumber the combined personnel total of all U.S. Gulf allies. Iraq continues to pursue weapons of mass destruction, and is attempting to acquire a nuclear capability. According to recent reports, it is estimated that if Iraq were to obtain fissile material then Saddam Hussein could build a nuclear bomb within months. United Nations Special Commission has identified gaps in accounting for Iraq's current chemical stockpiles and capabilities and has not accounted for hundreds of tons of chemical precursors and 1000's of delivery warheads. UNSCOM also reported that Iraq has understated their declarations regarding the extent of its biological agents.Again, I would like to quote Secretary Powell from the same hearing, when he stated:We can have debates about the size and nature of the Iraqi stockpile. We can have debates about how long it will take them to reach this level of readiness or that level of readiness with respect to these weapons. But no one can doubt two things: one, they are in violation of these resolutions-- there's no debate about that; and secondly, they have not lost the interest to develop these weapons of mass destruction. Whether they are one day, five days, one year or seven years away from any particular weapons, whether their stockpile is small, medium or large, what has not been lost is the interest to have such weapons of mass destruction.Secretary Powell also made it clear that we aren't alone in our concern regarding the threat of Saddam Hussein. Referencing Arab leaders and their thoughts regarding Saddam, Secretary Powell added, ``There is no question in their minds that he's a threat to regional stability and peace. There is no question in their minds that he is a threat to the region and has demonstrated previously his willingness to use weapons of mass destruction. And there is no doubt in their minds that he continues to have the intent to develop these weapons of mass destructions.''So what now--what do we do? Do we hope that Saddam Hussein goes gently into the night or do we finally stand up to this dictator and let the world know that Saddam Hussein can no longer thumb his nose at the international community.We only need to go back a few weeks to see Saddam's duplicity. On September 16, 4 days after the President's speech at the U.N., the Iraqi government announced it would unconditionally allow the return of U.N. inspectors. However on September 20, Iraq backpeddled on its previous announcement by stating that the definition of ``unconditional access'' means no ``presidential sites'' and 24 hours notice before any inspection.''My reaction to this new definition of ``unconditional'' by Iraq is best summed up in an October 3 Denver Post editorial when it stated, ``Saddam, there you go again.''I ask unanimous consent that the entire article entitled ``Saddam Must Open Palaces'' be printed in the Record.",

    "text": " There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, By Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Craig):S. 1036. A bill to provide for a multi-agency cooperative effort to encourage further research regarding the causes of chronic wasting disease and methods to control the further spread of the disease in deer and elk herds, to monitor the incidence of the disease, to support State efforts to control the disease, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.Mr. President, last year, I joined eleven colleagues in an effort to pass legislation that dealt with the eradication, monitoring, and surveillance of chronic wasting disease. Today, I am offering similar legislation, the ``Chronic Wasting Disease Support Act of 2003.'' Before I discuss the legislation further, I first want to thank Senator Feingold for his leadership on this matter and for working diligently to eradicate the disease. I also want to congratulate the State of Colorado, especially those Departments and Divisions that have been on the leading edge of disease management and eradication. They faced a horrendous task--processing tens of thousands of tests on a tight time frame. While more work lies ahead, they are to be commended for their effort.What was first a serious problem in the western United States, chronic wasting disease now poses a serious threat to every State of the union. As a United States Senator, chronic wasting disease presents not only a great animal health challenge, but a scientific quandary as well. As a veterinarian, chronic wasting disease presents an even greater challenge to the scientific communities of both the States and the Federal Government because we know so little about the disease. This legislation, cosponsored by Senators Feingold, Kohl, Roberts, Campbell, Burns and Craig, is a bipartisan effort to defeat the disease and to send a message that CWD must remain a priority for the Federal Government.The importance of this bill to both the State and Federal Government cannot be emphasized enough. It authorizes $34.5 million in the battle against chronic wasting disease. Although the bill authorizes a substantial amount Federal funding to fight and eradicate the disease, the States will retain their undisputed primacy and policy-making authority with regard to wildlife management. Nothing in this act interferes with or otherwise affects the primacy of the States in managing wildlife generally, or managing, surveying and monitoring the incidence of chronic wasting disease. It is important that all members of our delegation and in both the House and the Senate, coordinate our efforts as we fight the disease.Chronic wasting disease, or CWD, may be a new threat to some. Others may not be familiar with it at all. However, it is not new to those of us in Colorado and Wyoming, who have been dealing with it for over twenty years, and if the disease continues to spread, those unfamiliar with the fatal disease will, unfortunately, become experts in CWD policy. The scientific community has gone to great lengths to deal with the disease on limited budgets. These experts, through scientific publication and Congressional hearings, have told us that, although we have learned a tremendous amount about chronic wasting disease, there is much that we do not know and much that we must do to eradicate it.One thing we do know is that sound science is the answer, and that the Chronic Wasting Disease Support Act of 2003 is intended to greatly increase research, monitoring, surveillance, and management of the disease on all levels. It bolsters testing capacity, diagnostics capabilities, and funding authorization.Increased research and research funding is necessary because the disease is quite simply a mystery--the origin and transmission of CWD remains unknown. Unfortunately, the only way to treat an animal with CWD or to contain the disease is to destroy the animal and cull the herd. Together, we must embark on an ambitious and sound scientific commitment for research and investigation to end chronic wasting disease. That is what this bill calls for--cooperation and collaboration, working together at both the State and Federal level to achieve a common objective. We must end chronic wasting disease, and we must begin our eradication efforts now.The impact CWD will have on wildlife and agriculture is undeniable, and the economic and emotional toll of the disease cannot be overstated. Communities that are economically reliant upon deer and elk related enterprises will feel the impact of CWD as concern about the disease grows. But we can stop this, and we must stop this. We have an opportunity to restore cervid health, to contain the disease, and, most importantly, to eradicate the disease. This is the challenge that I urge my colleagues to accept, and to take decisive action; adequate research funding that is directed toward the complete eradication of chronic wasting disease starts with this authorizing legislation.In those States that are already dealing with CWD, the fiscal demands required to manage the disease is quite apparent. State budgets are stretched thin as they cull wild and captive herds and research for workable solutions to stop the disease. With State budgets already strained, an infusion of Federal resources and technical assistance is required to help the States keep CWD from spreading, to treat infected or exposed populations, and to greatly expand research for testing and possible cures. This bill does just that by providing assistance in the form of grants, Federal research programs and incidence reporting, as well as scientific assistance. State and Federal cooperation will protect animal welfare, safeguard our valued livestock industry, provide relief to family elk ranchers, help guarantee America's food safety, and protect the public health.The Chronic Wasting Disease Support Act of 2003 provides the foundation for a nationwide increase in diagnostic capabilities. Undoubtedly, the spread of CWD and the increased awareness of the disease, will cause the demand for testing to grow exponentially--this bill helps us prepare to handle a large volume of cases efficiently and reliably. The legislation calls for the development of new testing methods to help us understand the disease, as well as developing a live test.Chronic wasting disease presents a common problem to the States and the Federal Government. The Federal conduit role that is provided in the bill will allow animal health experts to unravel the CWD mystery. The challenge we face is to achieve what we all recognize as a common objective--to understand CWD and to eradicate it. But, we must act quickly or this disease will redefine the wildlife characteristics of our States. Thank you, Senator Feingold. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,This Act may be cited as the ``Chronic Wasting Disease Support Act of 2003''.In this Act, the term ``chronic wasting disease'' means the animal disease afflicting deer and elk that-- (1) is a transmissible disease of the nervous system resulting in distinctive lesions in the brain; and (2) belongs to the group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, which group includes scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and Cruetzfeldt-Jakob disease.Congress finds the following: (1) Pursuant to State and Federal law, the States retain undisputed primacy and policy-making authority with regard to wildlife management, and nothing in this Act interferes with or otherwise affects the primacy of the States in managing wildlife generally, or managing, surveying, and monitoring the incidence of chronic wasting disease. (2) Chronic wasting disease, the fatal neurological disease found in cervids, is a fundamental threat to the health and vibrancy of deer and elk populations, and the increased occurrence of chronic wasting disease in regionally diverse locations in recent months necessitates an escalation in research, surveillance, monitoring, and management activities focused on containing, managing, and eradicating this lethal disease. (3) As the States move to manage existing incidence of chronic wasting disease and insulate non-infected wild and captive cervid populations from the disease, the Federal Government should endeavor to provide integrated and holistic financial and technical support to these States. (4) In its statutory role as supporting agent, relevant Federal agencies should provide consistent, coherent, and integrated support structures and programs for the benefit of State wildlife and agricultural administrators, as chronic wasting disease can move freely between captive and wild cervids across the broad array of Federal, State, and local land management jurisdictions. (5) The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and other affected Federal authorities can provide consistent, coherent, and integrated support systems under existing legal authorities.Congress finds the following: (1) Pursuant to State and Federal law, the States retain undisputed primacy and policy-making authority with regard to wildlife management, and nothing in this Act interferes with or otherwise affects the primacy of the States in managing wildlife generally, or managing, surveying, and monitoring the incidence of chronic wasting disease.

    "text": " There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of  By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Campbell):S. 1058. A bill to provide a cost-sharing requirement for the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit in the State of Colorado; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.Mr. President, an historian and poet once penned that the history of Colorado would be written in water. In the midst of Colorado's worst drought in 300 years, this prediction has proven an accurate account of life in the headwater State and has proven a strong reminder that water is indeed our most precious natural resource. Yet in Southeastern Colorado, home of the Arkansas River, finding clean, inexpensive water, can be difficult. That is why today I am introducing legislation that will ensure the expedited construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit--a pipeline that will provide the small, financially strapped towns and water agencies along the Arkansas River with safe, clean, affordable water. By creating a Federal/Local cost share formula to help offset the costs of constructing the Conduit, this legislation will protect the future of Southeastern Colorado.By way of background, the Arkansas Valley Conduit was originally authorized by Congress forty years ago as a part of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project. Due to the authorizing statute's lack of a cost share provision and Southeastern Colorado's depressed economic status, the Conduit was never built. Until recently, the region has been fortunate to enjoy an economical and safe alternative to pipeline-transportation of Project Water: the Arkansas River. Sadly, the water quality in the Arkansas has degraded to a point where it is no longer economical to use as a means of transport. At the same time, the Federal government has continued to strengthen its unfunded water quality standards.In order to comply with these standards, the region's municipalities have begun exploring options for water treatment, some of which are estimated to cost between $20 million and $40 million. Taken together, the municipalities alone are facing potential expenditures of up to $640 million simply to comply with federally mandated water quality standards. Construction of over a half a billion dollars worth of water treatment facilities is simply not a feasible alternative for the financially strapped farming communities along the Arkansas River. With the Conduit, the communities will not need to build new water treatment facilities.In an effort to resurrect the Conduit, last year, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell and I, worked to secure $200,000 for a Bureau of Reclamation Re-evaluation Statement on the project. Thanks to this effort, the people of the valley are beginning to realize that the Conduit is much more than just a pipedream, and that Congress is serious about fulfilling the promise of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project.According to the draft feasibility study, the Conduit is estimated to cost $200 million. My legislation calls for a 75/25 Federal/Local cost share, meaning that the local communities will be required to come up with at least $50 million to pay for their share. This is a sizeable sum, but is a far cry from the $640 million it would cost to build the new treatment facilities that would be required if the Conduit is not built. This will leave $150 million for the Federal government's share. However, I would like to point out that this $150 million undoubtedly would be exceeded if the communities were forced to seek Federal grants to help build new treatment plants.The Arkansas Valley Conduit will deliver fresh, clean water to dozens of valley communities and thousands of people along the river. The local sponsors of the project have initiated and are nearing the completion of an independently funded feasibility study of the Conduit, and have developed a coalition of support from water users in Southeastern Colorado. They continue to explore options for financing their share of the costs, and are working hard to develop the organization that will oversee the Conduit project.With the help of my colleagues, the promise made by Congress forty years ago to the people of Southeastern Colorado, will finally become a reality.I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, By Mrs. HUTCHISON:S. 1059. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to adjust the tax rate for political organizations; to the Committee on Finance.Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to correct an inequity in our tax code.Currently, we use inconsistent standards to tax different types of political campaign committees. Congressional campaigns are taxed at the applicable corporate rates: depending on how much taxable income a campaign generates, it will be taxed at rates that vary from 15 percent to 35 percent. However, all other campaigns must pay the highest corporate rate of 35 percent. This is unfair.It's wrong to tax some campaigns at rates that change according to income level and then arbitrarily charge others at the highest possible rate. This disparity particularly hurts local and State candidates who generally have relatively low levels of taxable income but have to pay the same 35 percent rate as campaigns that may generate more than $10 million in taxable income.The bill I am introducing today will eliminate this inequity by taxing all campaign committees at the corporate rate based on their level of income. No longer will congressional campaigns be allowed to receive preferred tax treatment. All campaigns will be treated the same.I hope my colleagues will support this effort to improve the fairness of the tax code.I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Carper, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Levin, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reid, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Miller, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Graham of Florida):S. 1061. A bill to authorize 36 additional bankruptcy judgeships, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2003, along with over a dozen Senators of both parties who are joining me on this legislation. This bill creates new temporary and permanent bankruptcy judgeships in districts that need them, and extends and converts other temporary judgeships.The substantial increase in bankruptcy case filings in recent years has created a dire need for additional bankruptcy judgeships. My bill would create 23 new permanent bankruptcy judgeships, 5 temporary judgeships, convert 2 temporary judgeships to permanent status and extend 2 other temporary judgeships. 17 States would receive new judgeships, as recommended by the Administrative Office for United States Courts.Among other things, the bill authorizes four new bankruptcy judgeships, and converts one from temporary to permanent status, for the District of Delaware, the Nation's most overloaded bankruptcy district. The most recent data show weighted filings for the district of Delaware surpassing 13,500 per judge, while the next busiest district faces only about 3,000.The bankruptcy bar in Delaware is among the most respected and accomplished in the country, as are our bankruptcy judges. But our judges are not superhuman. They must receive the assistance that this bill would grant them, and I intend to see that they get it.The Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2003 is long overdue and I urge my colleagues to support it.I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,This Act may be cited as the ``Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2003''.The following judgeship positions shall be filled in the manner prescribed in section 152(a)(1) of title 28, United States Code, for the appointment of bankruptcy judges provided for in section 152(a)(2) of such title: (1) Two additional bankruptcy judgeships for the southern district of New York. (2) Four additional bankruptcy judgeships for the district of Delaware. (3) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the district of New Jersey. (4) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the eastern district of Pennsylvania. (5) Three additional bankruptcy judgeships for the district of Maryland.

This legislation is being introduced today by Senator Biden, and is being cosponsored by myself and Senators Carper, Nelson of Florida, Clinton, Edwards, Graham of South Carolina, Hollings, Levin, Pryor, Reid, Chambliss, Miller, Alexander and Graham of Florida.This bill is another significant step forward in our efforts to strengthen Maryland's Federal bankruptcy court. We have been working for several years to get these additional judgeships approved, yet no legislation has been passed that would authorize them. With such inaction, the burden facing Maryland's sitting bankruptcy judges has grown, and Maryland has remained without the additional judgeships it so desperately needs to make our bankruptcy system work.Maryland's four sitting bankruptcy judges continue to show remarkable dedication given the extraordinary burdens placed upon them. However, additional judgeships remain essential to the fair and timely administration of the Bankruptcy Code for all of the businesses and individuals that come before the Maryland District.Since 1992, we have been requesting additional judgeships for the District of Maryland; thus far none have been approved. In 1992, there were approximately 15,000 bankruptcy filings in the District of Maryland. From 1998 to 2002, there were over 30,000 bankruptcy filings per year in Maryland. In the past few years the number of new filings per year has been closer to 35,000, and in 2002 there were 35,900 new cases. The caseload has more than doubled in the past ten years, and the Court still does its work with only four bankruptcy judges. This dire need for additional judgeships in Maryland has yet to be remedied by the Congress.This legislation provides four additional judgeships for Maryland, in accordance with a September 2002 recommendation from the United States Judicial Conference. These four additional judgeships would help reduce the overwhelming workload of the four sitting bankruptcy judges. As of June 30, 2002, the national weighted filing average for bankruptcy judges was 1,641. The weighted filing per judge for Maryland's four bankruptcy judges was 3,030--almost twice the national average. By Mr. CAMPBELL.:S. 1062. A bill to amend section 924 of title 18, United States Code, to increase the maximum term of imprisonment for offenses involving stolen firearms; to the Committee on the Judiciary.Mr. President, this week, May 11 through 17, is ``National Police Week 2003.''This is the week when thousands of law enforcement officers from all over the United States gather here in our Nation's Capital. Representing a full spectrum of our Nation's law enforcement personnel including local, State, and Federal officers, they gather here to honor their fallen comrades, as well as to celebrate all who serve this country and its citizens. Some of this year's highlights include the May 11 ``Law Ride,'' the May 13 ``Candlelight Vigil at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial'' and the May 15 ``National Peace Officers' Memorial Day Service'' which will be held on the Capitol grounds. These events are being held to specifically pay tribute to the more than 145 peace officers who were killed in the line of duty across the U.S. during 2002.In honor of ``National Police Week,'' today I am introducing two bills that will help improve our Nation's justice system and protect the law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line for us all on a daily basis.The first bill I am introducing is the ``Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 2003'' which would increase the maximum prison sentences for violating existing stolen gun laws.A growing number of crimes in our country are being committed with stolen guns. The extent of this problem is reflected in a number of recent studies and news reports which indicate that almost half a million guns are stolen each year.This problem is increasing, and is therefore especially alarming among young people. A Justice Department study of juvenile inmates in four States showed that over 50 percent of the inmates in those prison systems had stolen a gun. In the same study, gang members and drug sellers were also more likely to have stolen a gun.Specifically, this bill would increase the maximum penalty for violating four provisions of the firearms laws. Under title 18 of the U.S. Code, it is illegal to knowingly transport or ship a stolen firearm or stolen ammunition. It is also illegal to knowingly receive, possess, conceal, store, sell, or otherwise dispose of a stolen firearm or stolen ammunition. The penalty for violating either of these provisions is a fine, a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years, or both.My bill increases the maximum prison sentence to 15 years.I am a strong supporter of the rights of law-abiding gun owners. However, I firmly believe we need tougher penalties for the illegal use of firearms.The ``Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 2003'' will send a strong signal to criminals who are even thinking about stealing a firearm. I urge my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 2003 be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,This Act may be cited as the ``Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 2003''. By Mr. CAMPBELL:S. 1065. A bill to establish a matching grant program to help State and local jurisdictions purchase bullet-resistant equipment for use by law enforcement departments; to the Committee on the Judiciary.Mr. President, the second bill I am introducing today is the ``Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 2003''.This bill is named in honor of Officer Dale Claxton of Cortez, CO, a fine law enforcement officer and family man, who was fatally shot through the windshield of his patrol car on May 29, 1998, after stopping a stolen truck. His assailants turned out to be dangerous fugitives and as a result, a large-scale man hunt was launched. The assailants were brought to justice, but Officer Claxton was tragically and prematurely taken away from his wife and four children.``The Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act'' would aid law enforcement agencies in acquiring bullet resistant equipment for their forces, including bullet resistant glass for law enforcement vehicles, hand-held shields and any other equipment that officers may need when they serve on the front lines of law enforcement. Specifically, this legislation would help our Nation's State and local law enforcement officers acquire the bullet resistant equipment they need in order to protect themselves from would-be killers. This legislation would authorize the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance to administer a $40 million matching grant program to assist these agencies purchase bullet resistant equipment.This legislation is a worthy companion, and similar in many ways, to S.764, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, which I recently introduced for reauthorization. Like S. 764, today's bill would help State and local law enforcement agencies acquire bullet resistant equipment--however this bill would simply provide for a wider array of bullet resistant equipment to supplement bullet proof vests.As a former deputy sheriff, I am personally aware of the dangers which law enforcement officers face on the front lines every day. One way in which the Federal Government can improve their safety is to help them acquire bullet resistant glass and other equipment for patrol cars. These partnership grants are especially crucial for officers who serve in small, local jurisdictions that often lack the funds to provide their officers with the life saving equipment they may need.The second component of this legislation would launch expedited and targeted research and development by authorizing $3 million over 3 years for the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice, NIJ, to conduct research and development of new bullet resistant technologies, such as bonded acrylic, polymers, polycarbons, aluminized material, and transparent ceramics.Promising new bullet resistant materials now being developed could be as revolutionary in coming years as the development of Kevlar was in the 1970s for the manufacture of body armor. These exciting new technologies promise to be lighter, more versatile and hopefully less expensive than traditional heavy bulletproof glass.Our Nation's police officers, sheriffs and deputies regularly put their lives in harm's way as they protect the people and preserve the peace. They deserve to have access to the bullet resistant equipment they need. The Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act will both accelerate the development of new lifesaving bullet resistant technologies and then help get them deployed into the field where they are needed. Officers lives will be saved.I ask unanimous consent that the text of Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 2003 be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,This Act may be cited as the ``Officer Dale Claxton Bulletproof Police Protective Equipment Act of 2003''.(a) Findings.--Congress finds that-- (1) Officer Dale Claxton of the Cortez, Colorado, Police Department was shot and killed by bullets that passed through the windshield of his police car after he stopped a stolen truck, and his life may have been saved if his police car had been equipped with bullet-resistant equipment; (2) the number of law enforcement officers who are killed in the line of duty would significantly decrease if every law enforcement officer in the United States had access to additional bullet-resistant equipment; (3) according to studies, between 1990 and 2000, 1,700 law enforcement officers in the United States were shot and killed in the line of duty; (4) the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that the risk of fatality to law enforcement officers while not wearing bullet-resistant equipment, such as an armor vest, is 14 times higher than for officers wearing an armor vest; and (5) the Executive Committee for Indian Country Law Enforcement Improvements reports that violent crime in Indian country has risen sharply despite a decrease in the national crime rate, and has concluded that there is a ``public safety crisis in Indian country''. (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to save lives of law enforcement officers by helping State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies provide officers with bullet- resistant equipment and video cameras.(a) In General.--Part Y of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended-- (1) by striking the part designation and part heading and inserting the following:(a) In General.--Part Y of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended-- (1) by striking the part designation and part heading and inserting the following: ``PART Y--MATCHING GRANT PROGRAMS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT(a) In General.--Part Y of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended-- (1) by striking the part designation and part heading and inserting the following: ``PART Y--MATCHING GRANT PROGRAMS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ``Subpart A--Grant Program for Armor Vests'';(a) In General.--Part Y of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended-- (1) by striking the part designation and part heading and inserting the following: ``PART Y--MATCHING GRANT PROGRAMS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ``Subpart A--Grant Program for Armor Vests''; (2) by striking ``this part'' each place that term appears and inserting ``this subpart''; and (3) by adding at the end the following:(a) In General.--Part Y of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended-- (1) by striking the part designation and part heading and inserting the following: ``PART Y--MATCHING GRANT PROGRAMS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ``Subpart A--Grant Program for Armor Vests''; (2) by striking ``this part'' each place that term appears and inserting ``this subpart''; and (3) by adding at the end the following: ``Subpart B--Grant Program for Bullet-Resistant EquipmentIn the case of any equipment or products that may be authorized to be purchased with financial assistance provided using funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act, it is the sense of Congress that entities receiving the assistance should, in expending the assistance, purchase only American-made equipment and products.Section 202 of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3722) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(e) Bullet-Resistant Technology Development.-- ``(1) In general.--The Institute is authorized to-- ``(A) conduct research and otherwise work to develop new bullet-resistant technologies (i.e., acrylic, polymers, aluminized material, and transparent ceramics) for use in police equipment (including windshield glass, car panels, shields, and protective gear); ``(B) inventory bullet-resistant technologies used in the private sector, in surplus military property, and by foreign countries; and ``(C) promulgate relevant standards for, and conduct technical and operational testing and evaluation of, bullet- resistant technology and equipment, and otherwise facilitate the use of that technology in police equipment. ``(2) Priority.--In carrying out this subsection, the Institute shall give priority in testing and engineering surveys to law enforcement partnerships developed in coordination with high-intensity drug trafficking areas. ``(3) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this subsection $3,000,000 for fiscal years 2004 through 2006.''.",

    "text": "Mr. President, hospitals in the United States have enormous responsibility. The Nation's hospitals care for patients, perform surgeries, train interns, research cures to diseases, and provide millions of dollars annually for the uninsured. Their services improve Americans' health and lives and better our communities. I laud their service to Colorado and the Nation.Recently Solucient, a company that provides health care data to improve health care results, published its list of the Nation's 100 top hospitals. Four of Solucient's designees are Colorado hospitals: Saint Joseph Hospital in Denver, Rose Medical Center in Denver, Swedish Medical Center in Englewood, and Lutheran Medical Center in Wheat Ridge. Solucient determines its selection of top hospitals according to hospitals' consistent and superior quality care, financial performance, and efficient delivery of care. According to Solucient, the Top 100 hospitals treat more, and sicker, patients with better survival rates and fewer complications.I am pleased to acknowledge Solucient's selection of Colorado hospitals for its quality service, dedication, and commitment to providing quality health care for Colorado, the Nation, and the world. First, Solucient has recognized Saint Joe's Hospital in Denver in its studies of orthopedic and intensive care units. According to the hospital, Saint Joe delivers more babies than any other Colorado hospital, serves more patients in gastroenterology, general surgery, pulmonology, cardiac care, nephrology and rheumatology than any other acute care hospital in the Denver metropolitan area, and for the past 5 years the hospital has cared for more cardiology and open heart surgery patients than any other acute care hospital in the metro area.Second, Exempla Lutheran Medical Center specializes in cardiology, oncology, orthopedic services, and women's health care. Lutheran Medical also provides special care to the community through its community clinics, special programs and services for the elderly, and hospice care. In addition, Lutheran Medical Center's Emergency Department has the second highest patient load in the Denver metropolitan area.Third, with a mission of commitment to patients, Rose Medical Center in Denver asserts a reputation for high quality health care and quality customer service. Rose Medical Center specializes in women's health services, general surgery, internal medicine, pediatric care, and emergency services. Rose Medical Center also partners with philanthropic organizations to help offer services to the Colorado community. Further, Rose Medical Center is the official health care provider for the Denver Nuggets professional basketball team and the Colorado Avalanche professional hockey team.Fourth, Solucient recognized a teaching hospital in Englewood, Colorado, Swedish Medical Center, which has six ``Centers of Excellence:'' the Colorado Neurological Institute, adult &amp; pediatric trauma services, advanced radiology capabilities, cardiology services, cancer treatment services, and women's and children's services. In addition, Swedish is a Level I Trauma Center and is a leading referral center for neurotrauma. Swedish also offers services for the elderly, emergency medical service education, and has a Family Medicine Residency Program.I am pleased these Colorado hospitals have been recognized as leaders in quality, efficiency, and financial responsibility in institutional health care. I laud their work and am expectant for their continued high quality of care and progress for Colorado and the Nation.",

    "text": "The Senator from Minnesota. Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect and compassion for my colleague from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and for his commitment to what this institution is all about.I don't know if I can find the words to describe the feeling that I have, elected just this year to the Senate, to these hallowed halls. I listened to the reading from my friend and colleague from Arkansas from Caro's ``The Master of the Senate.'' It is a humbling honor to be part of this body, to be part of the flow of history, a flow that has helped develop the greatest nation in the world. We got there due to divinely inspired guidance from the Founders of this great Republic who gave us a Constitution which provides a sense of clarity of our roles and responsibility. If we decide to only abide by it 98 percent of the time and the folks who follow us decide to abide by it 98 percent of the time, we are in trouble. My colleagues across the aisle have a sign that says 168 to 4. They are proud of that. I am stunned. I am absolutely stunned. If the airline I flew back and forth to Minneapolis would advertise 98 percent of the time they would get me there safely, I wouldn't fly.Think about the Constitution. I could walk you through it. First amendment of the Constitution; Congress shall make no law respecting establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press. If there were 172 newspapers in the United States and I said 168 of them are going to have freedom of the press, but not the other 4, where would we be?Second amendment to the Constitution: Right to bear arms.In Minnesota, we bear arms. A lot of folks were out deer hunting last weekend there. If I were to tell a group of 172 Minnesotans that 168 of you have the right to bear arms, but not 4, 98 percent, I don't think they would be happy Americans.I could go through every amendment. Third amendment: no soldier shall in a time of peace be quartered in any house without the consent of owner, nor in time of war but in a manner prescribed by law, the third amendment to the Constitution. If I went to a group of homeowners and said, you are going to quarter soldiers, 2 percent of you are, they wouldn't be very happy, and they shouldn't be.We took a solemn oath to preserve and defend and abide by the Constitution of the United States. That is how we got here. That is our obligation once we got here. It wasn't a partial thing. It wasn't an almost thing. It wasn't a but-for thing, and it wasn't a 98 percent thing. It was to preserve the Constitution. The fifth amendment to the Constitution: Individuals cannot be compelled to testify against themselves. Can you imagine if we said that applies 98 percent of the time? It doesn't work that way. It should not work that way. There is a reason why. You have to think about this. Again my colleague read the history of the Senate. It is a magnificent history. But the public out there has to ask the question: Why in the over 200 years of this Republic has there never been up until now a partisan filibuster that has stopped judges from being confirmed.Yes, we have the right to advise and consent. The Constitution gives the President the opportunity to appoint judges. We are then to advise and consent. He nominates. We advise and consent. But we do it by a simple majority. We cast our vote. If you don't agree, you vote them down. If you agree, you vote them up. But for the history of this Republic, we have a process which we abide by, the Constitution. That was reflected in the readings from my colleague from Arkansas. Treaties, as he noted in his comments, require in the Constitution a supermajority, but not judges.",

    "title": "CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005",
    "text": "Mr. President, we have heard a lot of discussion about how important eliminating the deficit is. I could not agree more. We do need to eliminate the deficit. The reason we have a deficit today is because this Senate has refused to make tough choices about spending.I make the point that when President Bush assumed office, he came into office when the economy was starting to move down. I don't think anybody can dispute that. When he took office, he was challenged as much as any President in recent history because not only was the economy turning down--and, I might add, with an unprecedented turndown of 2 to 3 years consecutively--but then on top of that we had the September 11 terrorist attack. We went to conflict in Afghanistan, as well as Iraq. It has been a tough time for this President.Fortunately, this country has had strong leadership. Without that strong leadership, I would hate to imagine where we might be today.We look at the combination of all these events as having an impact on revenues coming into the Federal Government. They had an impact on spending. I have been a supporter of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, as have many Members of the Senate, but there has always been a provision in times of conflict that there would be an exception to balance the budget. This is one of those exceptions in time caused by the attack on September 11 against the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. Then we lost a plane in the Midwest. Heroic, Americans on that plane tried to take over that particular plane. So I think it is understandable why the Senate and the House would decide we need to appropriate some dollars to take care of this time of conflict.If we look back, the spending was probably the second most significant thing that contributed to our shortfall as far as eliminating the deficit. The most significant factor was the recession.An analysis has been made by the Joint Economic Committee that has indicated that at least 40 percent--and there are other estimates of at least 49 percent--of the deficit can be attributed to this unprecedented recession.Then, second in line is the amount of spending we have had, somewhere around 35 percent, if my memory serves me correctly. I might be off a few percentage points. And then somewhere around 25, 26, 27 percent--in that area--was attributed to the tax cuts we put in place.The problem has been basically the turndown in the economy and the amount of spending. I think it is all too easy to go ahead and criticize the tax cuts and ignore the major reasons as to why we are having a shortfall in the deficit. I happen to think the tax package we passed when the President was first elected, and then we came back and passed an economic stimulus package, and then last year we passed another package of tax cuts, really did stimulate the economy.We are going to have amendment after amendment on the floor saying we ought to increase spending and increase taxes. I think it is the wrong way to go. I think if we raise taxes, as our economy is showing signs of recovery, it sends the wrong message, and that later on this year we will find our economy still struggling and trying to work its way out of this economic downturn. But if we can sustain these tax cuts--in fact, even those that are expiring, if we go ahead and renew those, I think it will instill confidence in our economy and that we can expect it to continue to do well for the rest of the year.I think the American workers need a break. Frankly, they send a lot of money to Washington. The producers of this country send a lot of money to Washington. From our colleagues on the other side, we hear all about how they want to go ahead and tax the wealthy, the upper 10 percent or the upper 1 percent, and then provide some program of sustained spending that is never going to quit. It is going to continue to grow.If we look at our tax policy, we put taxes in on a temporary period of time--10 years most of them--and then they go away. In our spending programs, we put them in place, and they just seem to go on and on and on.If we look at what happens to those tax figures as we go out in time in the budget, and we look at what happens to the spending figures as we go out in time from this year, the spending increases at a greater rate than the cost from the tax cuts. In other words, if we were to spend an equal amount of money for tax cuts and an equal amount of money for one of the spending programs, as it moves out over time, there is a discrepancy that develops, and spending increases at a greater rate than what happens with the tax cut.I think it is something we need to do. I think it would be shameful if we abandoned the President's plan for economic growth, particularly when the economy is starting to recover.There are those who would argue they do not think the jobs are coming or growing as fast as they would like to see. I agree, we would all like to see the jobs grow faster, but the fact is we are getting job recovery.If we look at the household survey, for example, for a number of months now--close to 9 months--we have seen some phenomenal growth. Why is the household survey important? Because it measures small business. It measures individuals who are out producing on their own, or a few people are out producing on their own. There is no salary. They are all in together. They decide to start a company or provide a service.I am a veterinarian. A lot of them are veterinarians. They are a single-person practice. They are going out there and taking care of the needs of the community, and they are working and creating revenue for their family. They pay property taxes. They are supporting their community. But they never get counted, except in the household survey, because they may very well be operating out of their home.We have a plethora of small businesses that work that way. We have seen this growth. I think a good percentage of that growth has been so phenomenal that they are trying to come up with an explanation for it.Here is my conclusion. I think when we had the downturn in the high-tech sector of our economy, many of those individuals left their former employers with some kind of bonus when they separated, so they had this pocket full of cash. They did not have a job, so they thought: Here is a great opportunity for me to go into business for myself.A lot of these businesses are things that can sustain themselves if you have a good computer system and you can run it out of your home. Your costs are minimal. It is a great opportunity for an entrepreneur to take some idea he may have and start a business for himself, with a relatively inexpensive operation, and running it out of his home. That is the American dream.This is the small business sector. This is where Americans have hope not only of owning their own home, but also of going into business for themselves. A lot of them have this desire.I think when we saw the downturn and a separation of many employees from high-tech companies, they took the separation bonuses they were getting and took this opportunity to go into business for themselves. I think that is great. That is the strength of America.Now let's look at the payroll survey. The payroll survey in the last couple months has been showing a growth. That is the last parameter, historically, that you see happen when the economy is recovering. I think that is great.We saw job growth this month. Maybe it was not as great as some would like to see it. The previous month was a phenomenal figure; in fact, it led to some pretty optimistic projections on job growth this month that did not occur. But I think over time we are going to continue to see this growth in jobs. I think that is very important to the recovery efforts, and our tax cuts have contributed to that. We recognize this in the budget which the Republican Budget Committee has proposed and brought to the floor. I think it is one that recognizes our economy is starting to recover.This economic growth is going to help us eliminate some of our deficit problems. I am optimistic about that. I think we made some tough decisions in this budget when we made some spending decisions.Last year, I told the chairman of the Budget Committee that we simply had to have a plan on how we were going to eliminate the deficit. Obviously, we had to limit the spending parameters. So the Budget Committee went ahead, last year, with a plan as to how to pay down the deficit. What I was watching for this year was to make sure we stayed on plan to eliminate that deficit within 10 years. And we are well within the plan.I was pleased, at the first of this year, when the President endorsed the idea that we needed to have a plan to pay down the deficit. The plan he put forward was a 5-year plan. It said, as a percentage of gross domestic product--which is probably, from an economist point of view, a very realistic way of looking at the impact of our deficit on the economy--that in 5 years we want to eliminate it by one-half.I looked at those figures and, lo and behold, the nominal rate was also reduced in half. Now, this is the actual dollar figure. The Budget Committee did better than that. They eliminated the plan. They did better than that. They reached about where the President was in about 3 years or so. And both the figures--as a percent of gross domestic product and nominally speaking, where we look at actual dollars--has got us well on the way to eliminating the deficit.I am proud to support this budget because we are taking a realistic approach.Spending is a problem. We are going to have to take a serious look at spending. I remember when we passed the budget in 2000, the last year of the Clinton administration, we were trying to adjourn the Congress. In the last few days of that session, we passed over $500 billion in new spending. We had to compromise with then-President Clinton on a lot of his spending priorities. He was moving out of office. We were trying to get out of session so we could move on with the election. That $500 billion in new spending over a 10-year period is now coming home to roost.We are beginning to see phenomenal growth in spending in programs. It strikes me how many people believe we need to do more spending. If we look out at producers in the country, the taxpayers, they are having to take cuts. Many of them are losing their jobs. Yet the agencies can't afford to take a cut. Even the President's budget, as austere as it is, takes care of defense needs. We are in conflict. It takes care of homeland security to protect the country, and we should put our efforts into that. It is a very small increase in the rest of the budget, about .5 percent.The fact is, there is still an increase in spending. While the rest of the country is suffering reductions in their household spending, the Government still claims it needs increases year after year, despite what happens to the economy.There are going to have to be some serious decisions made about spending programs. Some of those decisions are going to be made this year. That is a step in the right direction. We need to look at what it is we can put in place as a policy for the Senate and the Congress to hold down spending. In 2002, a number of provisions we had adopted that would help us restrain spending in the Congress, help us restrain spending on the Senate side, expired. When they expired, we all of a sudden began to see spending increases. We needed to have budget parameters. Thankfully we began to put them in place in the last budget, and we are going to put them in place now with this budget.I know the chairman committed during our Budget Committee deliberations he would work with the ranking member to see if they cannot put together legislation and send a bill to the President he could sign where we could put in place some of the President's recommendations on how we can restrain spending and some of the recommendations of Members in the Senate. They are giving a lot of serious thought to it. I know Senator Conrad, as well as Senator Nickles, is thinking about it. I commend them both for looking at some of these parameters.We have in this particular budget some provisions to help restrain spending in the future. Hopefully we can keep those in the budget, and hopefully they will be applied in a way that will help hold down spending.I want to talk a little bit now about who is paying the taxes. About 1 percent of the population, the top 1 percent, pays 34 percent of the individual income taxes. These are 2001 figures. Then if we look at the top 50 percent, they pay about 96 percent. That means the bottom 50 percent of individual income tax filers is paying the balance, is paying only 4 percent of the individual income tax. We keep hearing talk about how the producers of the country, the top 50 percent of the country, are getting off scot-free. They are the ones who are really making a difference. They are the ones who are making our economy move. I made some comments in this regard yesterday.I also looked at the amount of money. If you take all the income tax filers together, the whole group of them, and you take those paying $100,000 or more in taxes, they pay 75 percent of our total income taxes. So they are paying their fair share.Today a study was brought to my attention that had been done by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Usually I don't pay too much attention because they don't actually end up focusing on tax cuts and the tax issue. But they have come up with some very interesting data, more current than what I was quoting as far as the tax foundation was concerned. The bottom 50 percent of taxpayers is paying minus 3 percent of income taxes. In other words, our earned tax credits are kicking in, and they are showing the bottom 50 percent of the taxpayers is paying a minus 3 percent of income. The earned income tax credit is a cash payment we give to those with lower income. Fourteen percent of the payroll taxes come from that 50 percent.Yesterday somebody said: You didn't talk about the payroll taxes. This bottom 50 percent makes up about 14 percent of the payroll taxes. That is only 5 percent of all income and payroll taxes. So when we combine those together, we come up with 5 percent. That includes your filers, plus the withholding from their taxes.What happens to the top 10 percent of the taxpayers? The top 10 percent pay 71 percent of our income. That is based on the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Thirty-two percent of those are payroll taxes. That is a total of 53 percent of all income and payroll taxes together. So 10 percent of all taxpayers, including income tax plus payroll taxes, are paying 53 percent. The bottom 50 percent is paying 5 percent when you combine them.The producers of this country, the wealthy, if you want to put them in that category, are the ones who are really making a difference.It is time we put aside class warfare and talk about meaningful change in the economy that will make a difference.I yield the floor.",

    "text": "Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Senate's attention the retirement of a Colorado native from the U.S. Army, LTC Julia Cook.Lieutenant Colonel Cook has distinguished herself with exceptionally meritorious conduct while serving in key positions of ever increasing responsibility as an Army quartermaster and human resources officer, culminating her career as a legislative liaison for Secretary of the Army, Office of the Chief Legislative Liaison. During her years of superlative service, Lieutenant Colonel Cook consistently demonstrated exceptional leadership, resourcefulness and professionalism while making lasting contributions to Army soldiers and families, readiness and mission accomplishment. Lieutenant Colonel Cook's 20 years of dedicated and faithful service enhanced the soldiers and the units to which she was assigned and reflects the greatest credit upon herself and the U.S. Army.Lieutenant Colonel Cook was commissioned a second lieutenant through the ROTC program, Quartermaster Corps, after graduating from the University of Colorado in December 1984. Her first assignment, following the quartermaster officer basic course, was to Ft. Leonard Wood, MO, from 1985 to 1986, serving as XO for an AIT company that trained 63Bs and 64Cs and as an assistant brigade S4. She volunteered to serve in Korea from 1986 to 1988, distinguishing herself as tech supply platoon leader in 595th Maintenance Company, K-16 Air Base and as battalion S1, 227th Maintenance Battalion, Youngman. Following her tour in Korea, she completed the quartermaster officer advance course and was assigned to Ft. Carson, CO, from 1988 to 1993. Again she served superbly in a variety of positions, as the 4th ID DISCOM support operations officer; the S2/3, 704th Main Support Battalion; as commander, Company C, 704th Main Support Battalion; and as the division equal opportunity officer. She also deployed on a 6-month rotation to JTF-B, Honduras, serving as the logistics plans officer. From 1993 to 1997 she performed her duties as a soldier assigned to Headquarters, U.S. Army Materiel Command, AMC. She served in a variety of positions including, logistics operations officer in the Emergency Operations Center, staff action control officer for the Secretary of the General Staff, executive officer for the Chief of Staff, special project officer to Project Manager Soldier, and team executive officer for the Secretary of the Army's Senior Review Panel on Sexual Harassment after the Aberdeen Proving Ground Sexual Harassment scandal.After graduation from the Command and General Staff College, she was assigned to the 21st Theater Support Command, Kaiserslautern, Germany, from 1998 to 2001. While overseas, she served as chief, Distribution Management Center, where she developed supply distribution initiatives for a command supporting over 65,000 soldiers in European-based units. Lieutenant Colonel Cook's work enabled the Command to reduce shipping costs through the air challenge process by $2 million for the first two quarters of fiscal year 1999. She served as executive officer of the 191st Ordnance Battalion, Miesau, Germany, and was responsible for internal operations of a 600-soldier battalion consisting of a headquarters and headquarters company, an ammunition company, a quartermaster rigging detachment, and two explosive ordnance disposal companies, all while exercising oversight of a $2 million annual budget. Lieutenant Colonel Cook finished her career serving with the Army's office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison from August 2001 to May 2005 where she was the staff action officer and legislative assistant to the Undersecretary of the Army and the Sergeant Major of the Army. She prepared the Undersecretary and Sergeant Major for all interactions with Congress including hearings, office calls, and phone calls. Finally, she served in the program division as the Army legislative liaison between the U.S. Congress and the Army staff for all issues related to logistics.Through these assignments, Lieutenant Colonel Cook has provided outstanding leadership, advice, and sound professional judgment on numerous critical issues of enduring importance to both the Army and Congress. Her actions and counsel were invaluable to Army leaders and Members of Congress as they considered the impact of important issues. Lieutenant Colonel Cook's dedication to accomplishing the Army's legislative liaison mission has been extraordinary. She is truly an outstanding officer who displays superb professional leadership skills and is totally dedicated to mission accomplishment in the highest traditions of military service, and I thank her for her service to this great Nation.

    "title": "STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS",
    "text": "Mr. President, the events of the past few months remind us of the vital role of first responders in responding to natural disasters and terrorists attacks. First responders are just that: the first to respond. When they arrive on the scene, they often face fluid and volatile situations whereupon they are required to make split-second decisions, each of which has the potential to affect thousands of lives. For this reason, it is important that our first responders receive the training and experience needed to make critical life saving decisions under emergency circumstances. I believe that an essential element of preparing our first responders is to provide them with hands-on experience in simulated, real-world training environments.The importance of real world training was called to my attention by a visit to the Technology Training Center (TTC) in Pueblo, CO. There, I witnessed first hand the tools at our disposal to equip our first responders with the training they need, specifically in the context of rail and mass transit. Already aware of the training facilities at the disposal of our first responders through the Department of Homeland Security's National Domestic Preparedness Consortium (NDPC), TTC's potential to fill a gap in the rail and mass transit environment became apparent.Congress recognized the need to train first responders in the 1998 Appropriations Act, Public Law 105-119, and accompanying report. There, Congress stated that, while the Federal Government plays an important role in preventing and responding to these types of threats, state and local public safety personnel are typically first to respond to the scene when such incidents occur. As a result, Congress authorized the Attorney General to assist state and local public safety personnel in acquiring the specialized training and equipment necessary to safely respond to and manage terrorist incidents involving weapons of mass destruction.On April 30, 1998, the Attorney General delegated authority to the Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs (OJP) to develop and administer training and equipment assistance programs for state and local emergency response agencies to better prepare them against this threat. To execute this mission, the Office of Justice Programs established the Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) to develop and administer a national Domestic Preparedness Program.Upon passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-296, the ODP was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security from OJP. In 2003, a number of grant programs and functions from other DHS components were consolidated with ODP, including the NDPC, under a new DHS agency, the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness (SLGCP).Today, SLGCP is the Federal Government's lead agency responsible for preparing the nation against terrorism by assisting states, local and tribal jurisdictions, and regional authorities as they prevent, deter, and respond to terrorist acts. SLGCP's ODP provides tailored training to enhance the capacity of States and local jurisdictions to prevent, deter, and respond safely and effectively to emergency situations.ODP draws upon a coalition of ``training partners'' in the development and delivery of state-of-the-art training programs. This coalition is composed of government facilities, academic institutions, and private organizations, all of which are committed to providing a variety of specialized training for emergency responders across the country.ODP's major training partner is the NDPC, through which ODP identifies, develops, tests, and delivers training to state and local emergency responders. The NDPC includes: ODP's Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP): CDP provides advanced, hands-on training to members of the emergency response community in the areas of command, advanced hazmat, and tactical operations. CDP is the only WMD training facility that provides hands-on training to civilian emergency responders in a toxic chemical agent environment. New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NMIMT): NMIMT, a world leader in explosives research, serves as the lead NDPC partner for explosives, firearms, and incendiary devices training. New Mexico Tech also delivers a program on suicide bombing prevention. Louisiana State University (LSU): LSU provides training and expertise in the areas of law enforcement, bioterrorism, agricultural terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, and mass casualty incidents. Texas A&amp;M University System, Texas Engineering Extension Service (TEEX): TEEX develops and conducts national WMD preparedness training for all emergency response disciplines, as well as courses in incident management/unified command, threat and risk assessments, operations for public works, and WMD operations for emergency medical services. TEEX also conducts a structural collapse technician course to build state capabilities for urban search and rescue operations. Department of Energy's Nevada Test Site (NTS): NTS conducts radiological and nuclear training at NTS and via mobile training teams. It also develops and delivers radiological/nuclear mobile training at the awareness and operations levels and conducts train-the-trainer courses for first responders across the country.Although it consists of an impressive array of training facilities, the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium is not statutorily authorized and does not include a facility that is uniquely focused on emergency preparedness within the railroad and mass transit environment. Therefore, in addition to specifically authorizing the NDPC, this bill incorporates the Transportation Technology Center into the Department of Homeland Security's National Domestic Preparedness Consortium, filling a critical gap in its current training agenda.TTC is a federally-owned, 52 square mile multi-modal testing and training facility in Pueblo, Colorado, operated by the Association of American Railroads (AAR). In 1985, TTC established an on site Emergency Response Training Center (ERTC) to train railroad officials to safely handle accidents involving tank cars carrying hazardous materials. The training proved to be so successful that attendance was opened up to other emergency responders. TTC now serves not only the transportation service industry, but also the public sector emergency response community, the chemical industry, government agencies, and emergency response contractors from all over the world.Each year, an average of 1,700 first responders--from Portland, ME to Portland, OR--travel to Pueblo, CO, to participate in TTC's training program. Former participants include over 600 fire departments and entities from 45 states; 16 state police agencies from Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, and Washington; and numerous government agencies, including the U.S. Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Customs Service, Federal Bureau of Investigations, Environmental Protection Agency, Drug Enforcement Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Transportation Safety Board. In its 20 year history, the facility has trained more than 20,000 students worldwide.The ERTC is regarded as the ``graduate school'' of hazmat training because of its focus on hands-on, true to life, training exercises on actual rail vehicles, including tank cars and passenger rail cars. The ERTC is uniquely positioned to teach emergency response for railway-related emergencies with 69 railway freight cars, 15 railroad passenger cars, 25 highway cargo tanks, van trailers, and intermodal containers, and computer work stations equipped with the latest emergency response software. The Passenger Railcar Security and Integrity Training Facility is currently being developed to test various inspection, response, and remediation techniques' effectiveness for mitigation to incidents involving passenger railcars. This facility focuses on chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosive incidents and other activities associated with potential terrorist events.The distinctive environment of TTC allows testing and training activities to be carried out at a remote Colorado location without disruption to the flow of passenger and rail traffic in and around urban areas. Its inclusion in the NDPC presents a unique opportunity to enhance technology and training that will improve our Nation's ability to prevent, minimize, and respond to potential terrorist attacks similar to those recently seen in London and Madrid.It is for these reasons, among others, that I rise today to introduce a bill statutorily authorizing the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium, as expanded to include the Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, CO, and providing for its coordination and use by the Department of Homeland Security in training the Nation's first responders.",

    "title": "FIRST SESSION OF 109TH CONGRESS",
    "text": "I rise today to speak in review of the first session of this 109th Congress. I have served in the Congress since 1991, and I can say without exaggeration that this year has been the single most productive year I have participated in. As I will detail, we have passed numerous significant legislative items, some of which have languished in Congress for many years. We have stayed a determined course in the global war on terror, maintaining our commitment to our troops and to those eager to adopt a democratic way of life in place of tyranny. We have stayed a proven course to reduce the tax burden on Americans and on American business. Economic indicators in the markets, home ownership data, and employment all illustrate the wisdom of this course. This Congress has shown a very real commitment to principle. While there are those in this body and in the media who would like to deny it, I am confident that this session of Congress will go down in history as singularly productive and representative of the will of the people.The list of significant legislative items passed and signed into law this year is extensive. We got off on the right foot by passing a budget resolution out of the Senate on March 17, and the Congress adopted the budget conference report on April 28. This is amazingly early when compared to the struggles we have encountered in recent years. The Budget, as I have said many times before, is a vital blueprint for our work and a responsibility we must assume to serve the taxpayers. I am a member of the Senate Budget Committee and a former member of the House Budget Committee, and I am pleased to say that our chairman in the Senate has been as efficient and principled an advocate for good budgeting policy as I have ever worked with.In previous years, we have also struggled to complete our work on appropriations legislation. The House, where appropriations measures are to originate, reported every single appropriations bill out of committee by June 21. The Senate passed every bill before October 27. Today, as we wrap up a few remaining issues, all but the Defense and Labor-HHS bills have been signed into law, but it is important to note that these bills were passed by the Senate in October. The leadership on both sides of the Capitol and the members of the various appropriations subcommittees certainly deserve accolades for making such quick work of these difficult legislative items.Congress passed the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act authorizing more than $286 billion of investment in our national infrastructure. The Congress also took a major step forward this year by passing a comprehensive energy policy. A comprehensive energy policy will help America meet long-term demands for energy. This policy will encourage greater domestic production, fuel diversity, research and development of new energy technologies, and an across-the-board improvement of energy infrastructure. One piece of this forward-looking policy includes the Oil Shale Development Act, which I worked on with my colleagues. This has been a prominent issue for years, but we have made the right policy decision, and it is one that will benefit millions of Americans in the decades to come. This year, Congress also addressed the energy needs of low-income families by increasing funds for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program, LIHEAP. Increased funding for this program will help those in need as winter grows more cold.The work we have done on energy and transportation represents historic commitments to the public good. Virtually no aspect of our economic prosperity is unaffected by our fortunes in transportation and energy, and I am pleased to have been a part of these policy achievements.After years of opposition that cost consumers untold millions, Congress finally passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, the first major revision to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since 1978. This law will save approximately $3 billion a year for consumers through lower interest rates and better products and services. Consumers will further benefit from The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and the Class Action Fairness Act. The former puts an end to the frivolous lawsuits that sought to financially drain lawful firearms manufacturers for the acts of criminals, and the latter curbs abuses in our courts that have driven costs for consumers up without benefitting the public. Frivolous lawsuits forced the firearms industry to spend nearly $200 million a year to defend itself from third-party actions and class action lawsuits had grown over 1,000 percent nationwide. Lawyers were getting rich while consumers suffered. These two bills represent a major accomplishment for both consumers and American business. We also passed the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Implementation Act which will benefit American business, consumers, and our neighbors in this hemisphere.I would like to highlight another recent achievement of this administration and of this Congress that we celebrated this week when the first shipment of U.S. beef since December 2003 arrived in Japan. As my colleagues know the Japan Government recently declared that U.S. beef is every bit as safe as Japanese beef and that the beef trade may resume. This is a tribute to sound science, the hard work of our beef producers, and the diligent work of policymakers. It is with some pride that I note the first shipment of beef to be shipped to Japan was sent from Denver, CO.In addition to these notable and historically significant accomplishments, the Congress has also passed a more humble pair of consumer-friendly items in the Junk Fax Prevention Act and The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act. These aren't the kinds of bills that the Washington, DC, crowd may see as being vital national issues, but these are issues felt deeply by our constituents and the small business community.It cannot be overstated that these policies have fostered continued economic growth and prosperity. More than 56,000 jobs were created in our economy in October this year, and more than 4.2 million jobs have been created sine May 2003. Unemployment continues to steadily decline as more Americans than ever are working. This is a remarkable feat by policymakers, investors, small businesspeople, and families across the country. Our economy is strong.Congress continued the national commitment to our men and women in uniform in a variety of ways this year. Though we await completion on the Department of Defense appropriations bill, we have already passed into law more than $80 billion for the further prosecution of the war in Iraq, the reconstruction of Afghanistan, and aid for our international partners. We have increased the pay of our service men and women with an across-the-board 3.1 percent raise, increased housing allowances, increased bonuses for additional retention and recruiting, and increased specific bonuses for those deployed overseas. We have also increased the maximum life insurance allowed for an insured veteran or service member and secured more than $140 million for body armor and personal protection.I am particularly pleased with the steps we have taken to support our troops. Too often policymakers talk the talk without regard to action. It is my hope that we will continue to be responsive and supportive of our troops. The people of the United States are grateful for their dedication and courage. We tackled important veterans health issues this year, as well, by passing the Veterans Medical Services Supplemental. This legislation provided $1.5 billion to meet our commitment to those who have served our Nation.The same Defense supplemental appropriations bill included almost a billion dollars in aid for those impacted by the tsunami in the Indian Ocean almost a year ago, including more than $650 million for the Recovery and Reconstruction Fund.Though not a legislative accomplishment, this would be a good time to mention the tremendous yield we have seen from the years of work by this administration, the military, and Congress. This year started with Parliamentary elections in Iraq to democratically select those responsible for drafting the framework of a free Iraq. In October, the Iraqi people approved their new constitution, and the mechanisms of democracy are still working. In Afghanistan, after many years of turmoil, we also witnessed the free election of a Prime Minister and of the new Parliament. We must stay this course.In the past year, we have also enacted a series of legislative proposals to provide relief to families in the gulf region. The unprecedented impact of Hurricane Katrina demanded an immediate response. The Gulf Coast Emergency Water Infrastructure Assistance Act, The Community Disaster Loan Act, The Natural Disaster Student Aid Fairness Act, Pell Grant Hurricane and Disaster Relief Act, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Emergency Response and Recovery Act, and Katrina Tax Relief Act, among others, put us on the road to recovery. The pair of emergency supplemental appropriations bills that Congress passed total well over $65 billion and have provided needed infrastructure, security, and humanitarian relief. While there is a great deal of work to be done in the Gulf States, Congress has and will continue to demonstrate an ongoing commitment to this region.Congress also engaged in one of the most important debates we could hope to have as far as our national security is concerned, that of enhancing the security of our borders. This year's Homeland Security Appropriations Act provides unprecedented funding to protect our borders from those who wish to enter illegally. This year we passed more than $31 billion in new budget authority for the Department of Homeland Security, increasing border security accounts, providing an additional 1,000 border patrol agents, and providing more 220 detention beds.Among the most high-profile issues of the year were the nominations, hearings, and thus far one confirmation for the U.S. Supreme Court. Not only did the Senate confirm John Roberts to the Court, but Justice Roberts was also named to be the new Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. In the time since Chief Justice Roberts came before the Senate, we have also worked through a pair of nominations, one of which we will take up as our first order of business in the new year. The Roberts nomination demonstrated the value of our system and all of its various parts, working together for a greater good. I look forward to the timely hearings on Judge Alito's nomination and an up-or-down vote on his nomination.This has been an amazing year of accomplishment for the Congress. As I said earlier, there has not been a more productive year in my time here. As proud as I am of these many accomplishments I would also like to discuss a few accomplishments a little closer to my home, the State of Colorado, where we have had a pretty big year, as well.One of the ongoing projects I have worked on for many years now is the cleanup of Rocky Flats. This year, we secured more than $560 million for the final stages of the cleanup. Contrary to what many may expect, this cleanup was completed ahead of time and below projected costs, serving both the region and the taxpayer by cleaning up this facility.Another long-term project that I have worked on is the destruction of chemical weapons at the Pueblo Depot. By working with the Department of Defense, we have increased funding and maintained good management principles to meet our treaty obligations in the destruction of more than three-quarters of a million chemical weapons on site.Just down the road from Pueblo is Fort Carson. I recently held a town meeting at Fort Carson to discuss a variety of issues important to that base and to that community, including the political process that accompanies BRAC. We secured more than $120 million in military construction funds for new barracks and training at the facility as well as securing funds to prevent encroachment at the base. Even further on up the road is another jewel in America's military infrastructure, the U.S. Air Force Academy. Our ongoing efforts to assess progress and address problems at the Academy have been very productive thus far, and we secured $18 million to upgrade academic facilities and family housing this year. It is with some pleasure that I can also say I attended all four board of visitor meetings at the academy this year.This has also been a year of accomplishment for Colorado's space industry. This year we added $60 million for military satellite projects in Colorado, secured $12 million for the space control facility at Peterson Air Force Base, and $6 million for the space warning facility in Greeley. In keeping with these efforts to modernize and expand our posture in space I held four Space Power Caucus events. Space is indeed a great frontier, and it is one where we must maintain an aggressive stance. Just as it is important that the military sector be moving forward in space, it is equally vital that our workforce and our students learn about space science and perform cutting-edge research. This year we secured more than $10,000,000 for student space programs at the University of Colorado, Colorado State University, the Challenger Learning Center, and the Space Foundation. The students who will benefit from these programs are our future.Students in my home State will likewise benefit from our continued support of the University of Colorado's Center for Micro and Nano-technology, which will receive three-quarters of a million dollars for cutting edge scientific research that dwells on the cutting edge. Congress has seen fit to support Colorado State University's Pueblo campus, as well, providing $250,000 for the Western Forensic Law Enforcement Training Center.I spoke earlier of the importance of the highway bill and its impact on our Nation's infrastructure. In Colorado, this will translate in to a variety of projects. We secured $80,000,000 for the T-Rex highway improvement program, $5 million for the west corridor, and $9 million for the Colorado Association of Transit Agencies, a statewide coalition of agencies focused on the future of mass transit in my home State. Our successful year of investment in infrastructure includes a variety of projects around the State, including projects such as the Rio Grande bike trail in Garfield County, funding for the Pikes Peak Highway, State Highway 145 from Dolores to Stoner, the Ports-to-Plains Corridor, and Frisco's West Main Street.In the Agriculture Appropriations Act we secured more than $300,000 for the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Services for the Russian Wheat Aphid Resistance, Stress Tolerance and Quality Enhancement Project, more than 800,000 for infectious disease research to the Center for Economically Important Infectious Animal Diseases at Colorado State University, and almost $900,000 for the National Beef Cattle Evaluation Consortium, comprised of Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Cornell University, and the University of Georgia.Our efforts this year also yielded $400,000 for tamarisk eradication efforts, more than $10,000,000 for new science and technology facility at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and $10,000,000 for design and construction of a new NREL Administrative Facility, and more than $55,000,000 for the Animas-La Plata project. In addition to securing funding to help my home State combat chronic wasting disease, we worked this year to direct the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA to begin to promulgate rules for dealing with this disease.Another ongoing project that I have been pleased to work on with my colleagues is the modernization and expansion of the Centers for Disease Control lab in Ft. Collins. This facility, which provides vital research on vector-borne disease, will receive $24,000,000 this year.We have been very fortunate in the State of Colorado. I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues in recognizing the vital research, military, and educational facilities housed in Colorado.On a more personal note, this year I opened a new State office in Durango, CO. I would like to urge colleagues, if they have not been, to pay a visit to this charming mountain community in southwestern Colorado. Durango offers terrific recreation in summer and winter, and I look forward to being able to enhance my constituent service with this new office.Each of my State offices and my office here in Washington joined with the University of Denver and the University of Northern Colorado this year to host the sixth annual Allard Capitol Conference. This year, we hosted more than 100 Colorado citizens for 3 days of civic learning and participation. This annual conference is one of the most enjoyable things I am able to do with constituents each year.It has been an extraordinary year of accomplishment for the Congress and for Colorado. We have a tremendous amount of inertia going in to the second half of the 109th Congress, and I look forward to the new year and all of its challenges.",

    "title": "CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2007",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Akaka amendment. The reason I do is I am supporting the Burns amendment primarily because it negates the need for the fee proposals in the President's budget and increases funding for research. The President already provides an 11-percent increase from the fiscal year 2006 level, and over the years from 2001 it is a 69-percent increase. There may be some increased needs as we move through the next budget year for veterans. If that happens, then I see no problem with us going ahead, and the Senate historically has always been more willing to put that money in an emergency supplemental.The concern I have with the Akaka amendment is that it increases taxes. There were a number of amendments that were offered--and I assume they will be offered on the floor--in the Budget Committee that raise taxes to take care of this program or that program. The point I would make is that the tax reductions we did a number of years back have served this economy well, and when you allow the economy to grow, then all these programs are going to benefit indirectly because you increase revenues to the Federal Government. I would like to elaborate on that just a little bit before the Senator from Washington makes her statement.If I might just talk a little bit about some of the comments made by the other side, in particular Senator Conrad, as to what happens when we cut those taxes, reduced those taxes known as the President's economic growth package. It was predicted that when we would do that we would reduce employment. Senator Conrad noted for the record that the President has ``put us on a fiscal course that means lower employment.'' In reality, employment went up as reflected in this chart. He predicted that there would be ``a raise in interest rates,'' that the Republican budget would ``raise equilibrium real interest rates.'' That is Senator Conrad, again, in the Congressional Record.In reality, interest rates have stayed down. The statement was made that ``the economic growth package will crowd out private sector investment.'' Again, the comments were proven wrong by what happened to our economy. We see here that the private business investment surges.Then, the ``determining the economic growth'' comment that was made by Senator Conrad, again in the Congressional Record, that ``the budget will undermine potential gross domestic product and hurt economic growth,'' we see right here that we sustained economic growth.So the bottom line is that when we cut taxes, we help the economy. So I think it is bad to try to increase taxes at a time when our economy is doing so well. That is the objection I have to the Akaka amendment.I sympathize with him in making sure that we have enough money to take care of our veterans, particularly at a time when we are in conflicts. But I also need to make sure we have some accountability as far as taxpayer dollars are concerned, how they are spent. I think the President has been very generous with the 11-percent increase he is advocating from 2006 to 2007. He does that without increasing taxes. He has found a source of funding which negates the fees that were proposed in the President's budget a lot of us would just as soon not be there.So I find myself supporting the Burns amendment and opposing the Akaka amendment pretty much based on tax issues that are in those two amendments. I just think this would be the wrong time to increase taxes, when it would have just the opposite effect of the tax cut we implemented a few years back.So I just wanted to make that point. I think on this side you are going to find that we all support veterans. I can't recall a year when we haven't given substantial increases to veterans. But we also need to have some accountability in this process, and I think we restore that through the Burns amendment.I yield the floor.",

    "text": "I am very disappointed we cannot get that amendment up. I have been working now for some time to get that amendment to move forward. It is an amendment I filed last week. It is a simple, commonsense amendment that denies visas to advocates of terrorism. Yesterday morning, I came to the Senate to speak on that amendment and asked for a vote.Now, more than 24 hours later, we have still not had a vote on my simple, 14-line amendment. It is just one example of the Democrats continued obstruction of well intentioned efforts to debate and make improvements to the immigration bill.Put simply, the Democrats are denying me a vote on my proposal to deny visas to terrorists. Any Democrat who says this is anything other than partisan obstructionism are themselves in denial.To demonstrate the height to which this obstructionism has risen, I am again going to explain what my amendment does and how simple it really is.My amendment is so simple, in fact, that it adds only 6 words to the entire Immigration and Nationality Act. And half of those are the word ``or.'' The other three are ``advocate,'' ``advocates,'' and ``advocated.''These 6 words are narrowly targeted to address a loophole in our current visa system that is evidenced by the following statement:Colleagues, believe it or not, this a heading from our very own Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual. The same Foreign Affairs Manual issued to the Department's 25,000 employees located in more than 250 posts or missions worldwide.Even more alarmingly, this is from the chapter that instructs our consular officers to whom visas should be issued. Visas are, of course, the ticket that foreigners, including terrorists, need to enter the This instruction says to the consular officer deciding whether or not to issue a visa that they need not deny a visa to an individual who advocates terrorism. I, for one, cannot imagine a more pertinent ground for denial. If advocacy of terrorism is not grounds for exclusion, I don't know what is.Not only am I concerned about the message this sends to our dedicated consular officers, I am just as concerned about the message this sends to terrorists. It says to them, feel free to lay the groundwork for an attack at home, apply for a visa, and come to America to finish the job. This is not the message that the U.S. should be conveying to terrorists.This Congress has already passed important legislation denying visas to terrorists, including in the PATRIOT and REAL ID Acts. The REAL ID Act, signed into law on May 11, 2005, specifically states that one who endorses or espouses terrorist activity is inadmissible.The real REAL ID Act became public law on May 11 of last year, 8 days after publication of this manual. Yet, today, more 10 months later, the State Department is still instructing its consular officers that advocacy of terrorism may not be a ground for exclusion.Clearly, the State Department needs to be sent a message that we, in Congress, are serious about securing our borders. And particularly serious about preventing known advocates of terrorism--people who are most likely to wish harm to our country--from entering into the United States.Admittance to the United States is a privilege, not a right. My amendment says, if you advocate terrorism, you lose the privilege of coming to the United States.I would like the opportunity to debate this amendment. I, for one, am curious to hear from the Democrats their reason for opposing it.It is a common sense amendment worthy of debate and a vote. I urge my colleagues to join me in calling for a vote on this legislation that slams the door shut in the face of advocates of terrorism who seek to enter our country.I also submitted a second amendment last week which I believe is another commonsense amendment to improve the immigration bill.My amendment No. 3213 calls upon the administration to develop a plan for securing the borders to curb the inflow of vast quantities of methamphetamine into this country. Our Nation has been hard hit by the illegal trafficking of methamphetamine. My home State of Colorado is no exception. In just 10 years, methamphetamine has become America's worst drug problem--worse than marijuana, cocaine or heroin.According to estimates from the DEA, an alarming 80 percent of the methamphetamine used in the United States comes from larger labs, increasingly abroad, while only 20 percent of the methamphetamine consumed in this country comes from the small laboratories.Therefore, my simple amendment calls for a formal plan that outlines the diplomatic, law enforcement, and other procedures that the Federal Government will implement to reduce the amount of methamphetamine being trafficked into the United States.My amendment aims to build upon the methamphetamine provisions of the PATRIOT Act. We must impress upon the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security the immediate need for a firm plan of action. It is imperative that such a plan include, at a minimum, a specific timeline to reduce the inflow of methamphetamine into the United States.There must be a tough standard for keeping excessive amounts of pseudophedrine products out of the hands of methamphetamine traffickers. We must outline a specific plan to engage the top five exporters of methamphetamine precursor chemicals. It is important that we protect our borders to ensure national security and the safety of our communities.Now, here we are today, 1 week to the day after filing my methamphetamine amendment, and still there has been no opportunity for a debate, much less a vote. I urge my colleagues from across the aisle to allow us to proceed on this and other amendments worthy of debate.Mr. President, I yield for a question from the Senator from Illinois.",

I know this is also being discussed by the leadership. That is the one which states that advocates of terrorism be denied a visa.I have two amendments. My hope is we can get that particular amendment up for a vote. It is the one I just recently asked for a vote on and was denied by your side.

    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks recognizing the Reverend Roger Patrick Joseph Dorcy.The Reverend Roger Patrick Joseph Dorcy was born to Michael and Ellen Dorcy on July 4, 1946. Named for his Aunt Patricia, Patrick Joseph Dorcy was the third youngest of 14 siblings.Growing up in Omaha, NE, he attended Holy Cross School, Creighton Preparatory School, and Mount Michael Abbey.From 1967 to 1969 he worked for Senator Robert F. Kennedy in New York and Washington, DC.He received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from St. Meinrad School of Theology in Indiana and completed post-graduate work at Catholic University of America in Washington, DC.Prior to his ordination to the priesthood he was a member of the Order of St. Benedict, St. Meinrad Archabbey. It was there he took the name Roger. Brother Roger was one of the order's youngest teachers, the Archabbey architect, a paramedic, and a firefighter.When he left the Monastery, he moved to Colorado where he taught theology and English at St. Scholastica Academy in Canon City, CO. Finally answering his call, at the age of 33, Roger Patrick Dorcy was ordained a priest in the Diocese of Pueblo, Colorado, on January 29, 1980.He served as pastor at Sacred Heart Church and campus minister at Adams State College in Alamosa, CO. He was associate pastor at St. Leander's and Our Lady of Guadalupe Churches in Pueblo.

    "title": "WAR ON TERROR",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to discuss recent events that are positive steps in the war on terror for the United States and our allies abroad. The first is the announcement that the United States and foreign counterterrorism officials have worked together to make a series of arrests that appear to be linked to a web of Islamic extremists in Canada, the United States, and Europe. The recent death of Iraqi insurgent leader and al-Qaida member Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi is another. These are significant victories against those who wish our country harm.Last week, Canadian officials arrested 17 people for allegedly plotting to carry out a campaign of bombings, kidnappings and other terrorist acts in Ottawa and Toronto. The arrests were made possible by the monitoring of Internet chat rooms and e-mail accounts tied to suspected Islamic extremists. The arrests came after three tons of ammonium nitrate--common garden fertilizer that is easily transformed into an explosive--was allegedly purchased from undercover officers. Two of 17 suspected terrorists were caught trying to smuggle guns and ammunition from the United States into Canada via the Peace Bridge last summer.These individuals were allegedly using the Internet to communicate with terrorist facilitators abroad, such as a 22-year-old Web site operator with direct links to al-Qaida who was arrested by British police last October on charges of financing and supporting terrorist activities. Authorities believe the Web site operator was in contact with the individuals in the Canadian arrests, as well as two men in the U.S., sharing surveillance videos and other information for potential terrorist attacks. Included in the surveillance videos were many Washington, DC, landmarks.Also, just last Tuesday British police arrested an American student in London as he prepared to board a flight to Pakistan. He was wanted in New York for allegedly providing military equipment to people who took it to members of Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization in Pakistan. Authorities have not ruled out a connection to the Canadian arrests.Here in the U.S., the New York and Atlanta joint terrorism task forces recently arrested two men in connection with an alleged terrorist plot. The plot included discussions about blowing up oil refineries and disabling navigational aids on airplanes. The investigation began when California police arrested two men for a gas station robbery. A subsequent search of their home turned up documents listing the addresses of U.S. military recruiting stations, the Israeli Consulate, and synagogues in the Los Angeles area. The investigation eventually revealed the existence of a terrorist cell that had been spawned by a small radical group operating in Folsom Prison who considered themselves the ``al-Qaida of California.''American counterterrorism officials are joining forces with their colleagues around the world to unravel intricate webs of terrorist organizations that would do us great harm if not for the efforts of these countterror experts. I commend them for their efforts to discover terrorist plots and bring them to a stop before they are carried out.Much further from home, but still close to our hearts are the brave men and women of our Armed Forces deployed in the Middle East and Afghanistan.I thank our servicemen and servicewomen in the U.S. Armed Forces for their on-going service to their country, their commitment to American ideals, and their determination to win the global war on terror. We need to continually express our gratitude to the families of the U.S. military personnel, especially those families who have lost loved ones during our most recent deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.Most important, our Armed Forces continue to seek out terrorists to disrupt their plans both in the Middle East and abroad. They also continue to provide support and guidance to the Iraqi and Afghani people in their newborn democracies. With their steadfast courage, our citizens in uniform have taken the battle to the enemy and achieved success.Their most recent victory was the elimination of insurgent leader and al-Qaida member Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. His death is an enormous blow to those who continue to terrorize the Iraqi people. Zarqawi, whom Osama Bin Laden has heaped praise upon, has lead a horrific campaign against our troops in Iraq and against the Iraqi people. I am thankful to say that this mass murderer will no longer be able to carry on attempts at undermining the Iraqi national government and the coalition.Of note in his demise is the international cooperation that spearheaded the operation. After receiving tips and intelligence of his location from Jordanian sources, Coalition forces killed Zarqawi and many of his lieutenants yesterday in an airstrike. It was this exchange of intelligence information between the United States and Jordan that helped to permanently end Zarqawi's operations. I should also note that the Iraqi police were first on the scene after the air strike to help identify our success.Also, perhaps lost among this news yesterday was another announcement made by Prime Minister Al-Maliki of Iraq that candidates have been named for important cabinet posts in the Iraqi government. After much negotiation, consensus picks were made to fill the defense and interior ministries--both key to a more secure and stable Iraq. Much of our success depends on the men and women forming the Iraqi government, and these are important steps to meeting the security challenges.The recent announcements in Iraq and our international counterterrorism efforts, while significant, are only small victories in the overall global war on terror. There are more extremists who will line up to preach against democracy and freedom. There are still those that will attack the free people of this world and want to do us much harm.After news of Zarqawi's death, the forces of al-Qaida in Iraq vowed publicly to continue their so-called ``holy war'' on innocent civilians. They have stated:The death of our leaders is life for us. It will only increase our persistence in continuing holy war so that the word of God will be supreme.In fact, only two hours after the Zarqawi announcement a bomb blew up in Baghdad killing at least nineteen people. It is clear that our success in Iraq against this enemy depends greatly on our continual cooperation with the Iraqi government and the new ministers in charge of security there.The global war on terror has been a great challenge for our Nation. Yet while the cost has been high, the cost of doing nothing would be even greater. And we cannot do this alone. Only with help of our neighbors, countrymen, and allies throughout the world can we assure that our democratic ideals defeat those of the terrorist extremists. I thank all of them for a job well done.Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.",

Only 26 are rated ineffective in discretionary spending.Chairman Conrad will say the budget resolution cannot tell appropriators how to implement the savings.

    "title": "FAREWELL TO THE SENATE",
    "text": "Mr. President, I would like to now wrap up with a few comments. I have now spent 12 years in the Senate, 18 years in the Congress all together, when you consider the 6 years I served in the House of Representatives. I can say it has been a great experience. In my view, I have represented the best State in the Union. We refer to it as the ``Centennial State'' because it joined the Union exactly 100 years after we became the United States.It has always been enjoyable to talk to my colleagues and talk to visitors to the Capitol about my State of Colorado because they have usually had great experiences when they have visited my State. It is a tourist attraction. We have a lot of things that bring people to Colorado. It is a beautiful State. People have great vacations when they go there, and they are more than anxious to share their wonderful experiences with me, share the wonderful and welcoming attitude they experienced from the people of Colorado, and share with me how much they have enjoyed visiting the great State of Colorado.And, when people get tired of talking about the great State of Colorado, we have always been able to talk about their favorite cat or their favorite dog because, as a veterinarian, it has always been a common interest among many of my colleagues in the Senate, as well as visitors to our office, to talk to me about their favorite pet. So it has been a wonderful experience.This is the greatest legislative body in the world. It is an honor to serve here. There are a lot of dedicated employees who have helped me get things done in this body. They put their own political preferences aside and thought of the well-being of the institution. They have always been very polite and most supportive and helpful. I wish to thank them.I have had great employees in my office. I wish to mention that you get things done because of the people with whom you surround yourself. I have two members who are currently on my staff who have served with me since I was first elected to the Congress. I was elected to the House of Representatives in 1990. They came in with me and worked with me on the House side for 6 years and then they came over here and continued to work in my office for the last 12 years. I appreciate their dedication. Those kinds of people don't come along everyday. They spent 18 years with me, bless their souls. The two I speak of are Sean Conway and Doris Morgan. Both of them have been dedicated staff people who have helped to make my service to the people of Colorado successful.There are also some staffers who joined me after I became a Senator in 1997, in addition to the two I mentioned, including Andy Merritt, who is now my State director; Dick Poole, who is one of my top staff people; Tewana Wilkerson, who has helped me on the Banking Committee; and Kris Hanisch, who has helped us balance our books as well as helping us to move through the maze here in the Senate. We do have our own little bureaucracy in the Senate. She knows it and understands it and has helped us move through it. She has been my office manager and has kept us on the straight and narrow. I appreciate the dedication of all of the employees who have worked with me.I have a great group of employees currently serving me in my office. We have had a number of people who have come and gone, but I never felt it was because they were disappointed in having to work in our office. When I talked to people who came to work as employees in my office, I would say: If your ultimate goal is to work in a Senate office, I want you to rethink your goals. I want you to get an experience here that will help you grow once you leave the Senate, so you can be a better citizen, so you can contribute more fully to whatever path you decide to assume once you leave this great body and leave our office. So I have always tried to encourage them to think about where they want to go. We have had employees who have worked in my office, continued their education, and have become very outstanding. I have a number of former staff people who are actually serving in elected office; I think some five or six people right now who are serving. They decided to go back to Colorado and pursue elected office. I congratulate them, as they are very active citizens in their communities.I wish to mention some of the committee chairmen I have had an opportunity to work with. One of the committees I was successful in getting on was the Budget Committee, with Pete Domenici as chairman, and then Judd Gregg following him, and now we have Senator Kent Conrad. All of these chairmen have been very gracious and helpful in working with me on issues.Then I have had the chance to serve on the Armed Services Committee. Senator John Warner, a great friend, and somebody who is retiring and who has been very helpful, served as the chairman of that committee while I was on the Armed Services Committee.I also served on the Banking Committee. The first chairman I served under was Phil Gramm and then Richard Shelby and now Chris Dodd. I have to say I have been blessed with great leadership on all of those committees.I also served on the Intelligence Committee. I served with Senator Shelby, who was chairman, and Senator Kerrey who was ranking member at the time I served on the Intelligence Committee.Now I serve on a different committee this Congress, the HELP Committee. It deals with health, education, pension and labor issues. My well-known colleague here in the Senate, Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts, is chairman of that committee. He is a wonderful person and someone whom I greatly appreciate and who has spent a lot of time in Colorado, I might say.I also serve with my very good friend who was chairman of that committee for a while, Senator Enzi. I couldn't ask for a better friend. He is from Wyoming, a neighbor of Colorado. So we had many issues in common, and both Joan and I consider Diana and Mike Enzi as our very good friends.I wish to say a few things about those people who are retiring, starting with Senator Pete Domenici, who I mentioned was my chairman on the Budget Committee. I have worked with him also on the Appropriations Committee. I worked with him on energy issues and issues that are common to New Mexico and the State of Colorado. His service here in the Senate has been remarkable and dedicated. The West has been blessed that we have had such a good spokesman as Senator Domenici out there, carrying many of the issues that are important to his neighboring States, as well as New Mexico. The institution will miss him. I am sure New Mexico will miss him. I consider it an honor and a pleasure to have served with him.Senator Warner I mentioned earlier. We couldn't ask for a greater statesman. He has made a number of trips to Colorado. I worked with him on the Defense Authorization bill. He has been more than considerate and helpful to those issues that are important to Colorado. He has been supportive on matters that we worked on for Fort Carson and for Peterson Air Force Base and the Air Force Academy and the many other issues involving the military and military installations we have in Colorado. He has been tough at times, but his leadership has been greatly appreciated by me. I think the Senate and the country have been blessed because Senator Warner has been willing to dedicate so much of his time and effort to making this a better country, a stronger country. He is somebody I am very proud to have been able to serve with.Also retiring is Senator Larry Craig from Idaho, another westerner with whom I found a lot in common. He and I both have strong agricultural roots. He has been a very strong advocate of those issues important to the West and his State of Idaho. Again, I have appreciated working with him on national park issues and public lands issues. He is a superb individual.Another individual I wish to recognize who is retiring is Senator Chuck Hagel from Nebraska; again, one of the neighboring States of Colorado. The State of Nebraska is downstream from Colorado. So we have ribbed each other a little bit about water issues. Basically, though, we have been partners on water issues. We have been able to work together on many issues that have improved the management of water in the Platte River drainage system, which is one of the many rivers that originates in Colorado and flows downstream. I also worked with Senator Hagel on the Banking Committee. He was one who pushed early on for the reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He brought to this institution a great deal of experience. Again, he has decided to retire the same year as I have. I will always remember Senator Chuck Hagel and our relationship and how we have been able to work together, I think for the betterment of both of our States.I would be remiss if I didn't brag about my partner and my wife, Joan Allard. Joan has spent much of her time being with me, whether I have been in Colorado or here in the Senate. Senator Mitch McConnell talked about the town meetings she attended. She attended about as many of those town meetings as I. It has been kind of embarrassing at times because sometimes the number of people who came just to see her in the back of the room was large and they were having more fun back there than I was, up front trying to conduct the meeting. People loved Joan as they got to know her throughout the State of Colorado. Her dedication to me and to her family and the people of Colorado is remarkable and unique. We are known as partners here in the Senate. Wherever I go, Joan is very close by, and people are used to seeing us both at receptions. Many times I was invited to events where they wanted me to come alone. I said: No, I want my wife with me, and if you can't accept my wife, maybe we won't make the reception, because she is somebody who I didn't want to be divorced from this process. She has been willing to make a personal commitment in time and in supporting me in my work. So I wanted to make sure that the responsibilities of serving in the Senate didn't drive a wedge between what a wonderful relationship we have had. She worked side by side with me at the veterinary hospital. We worked and met the challenges of raising two wonderful daughters whom we are very proud of, and now we are seeing grandsons coming up. So I couldn't have asked for a more dedicated wife. We still have a lot ahead of us. I am very pleased that she was willing to take an interest in my job of representing the people of Colorado.The first vote I took in the House and in the Congress was on whether to authorize the first Gulf War in 1991. That was a tough vote. I have now possibly cast my last vote on the economic bailout or the stabilization act we voted on yesterday. So my congressional career has been bookended by hugely significant votes that have humbled me in terms of the trust the people of Colorado have granted. I wish to thank the people of Colorado who have been supportive and who have expressed their views to me in my town meetings, letters, e-mails, faxes, and phone calls. My office has sent out roughly 2.1 million constituent letters since I was sworn in. I say honestly that I relish every opportunity to hear from and explain myself to the people of Colorado. Even those who weren't supportive and who expressed those views in town meetings, letters, e-mails, faxes and phone calls, I thank them for that.I have no regrets and leave this institution with a clear conscience. I feel as though I have been true to my campaign promises and have worked to hold down taxes, hold down spending, hold down the growth of government here in Washington, and I have fought to balance the budget. I feel as though I have worked to defend local control and keep America strong. I have kept in mind private property rights and the power of the State in managing its own water resources.It is time to say goodbye and wish my colleagues the very best, and to wish my successor, whoever that might be, the very best. It is time for Joan and me to move on, hopefully returning to a future in the private sector. I came to Washington with small business experience, and I hope to continue working in the business sector. The challenge, as I see it, is for future Congresses to protect the freedom that continues to create opportunity for us and future generations and to ensure that we have a secure America.May God bless America, and may God bless Congress's future endeavors.I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.",

I rise in support of the Roemer amendment.Tomorrow, my 5-year-old daughter Jacqueline is going to enroll for kindergarten, and when my wife and I look at the cost of paying for an education, we really have our fingers crossed that some day she will earn an athletic scholarship to play lacrosse or soccer or field hockey or some other sport. We are going to need it.The day that her mother started college, there were far fewer opportunities for women to play intercollegiate sports. When her grandmother was growing up, very few women went to college at all. There has been a lot of progress in opportunities for women over the years, and I believe that we should do nothing to turn back the clock on that progress. It is very important that we reaffirm our support for title IX, as I believe this amendment does.I also believe that no one on the other side of this question wants to downgrade women's sports, and I understand that. I believe that we have gotten in an unfortunate box where, somehow or another, we believe that we are choosing between men and women in intercollegiate sports opportunities, and we should not.I happen to believe that the record does show, particularly in the case of some sports like men's wrestling, that there have been some unjustifiable decisions made that have hurt student athletes. And I, for one, am looking for a tool to try and remedy those injustices.With all due respect to its author, who I know is very well-advised and well-intentioned, I do not believe this is the right tool because of the expanded time window that is in it. I do share his conviction, however, that there ought to be some guarantee that before an institution chooses to terminate a sport that it ought to say exactly how much money it is going to save, justify those numbers so that the dynamic of the campus-based, decision-making community can look at that argument and see whether it is true or false.So I will support the Roemer amendment tonight, but I will offer my willingness to cooperate in trying to find a way to resolve this very serious problem.",

Gender discrimination has been institutionalized in American life. It is important that we try to uproot that discrimination from its roots, and what better place to start than the classrooms of America.I am particularly gratified that the authors of this amendment have included in it language that I suggested with respect to a special education program for gender equity that involves the birthplace of women's rights, in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, the Alice Paul Foundation. Alice Paul understood when she wrote the equal rights amendment, which we will yet ratify, and she understood when she led the fight for women's suffrage that discrimination on the basis of gender is rooted in American life.My grandmother was born at a time when women did not have the right to vote. My wife was born at a time when the smartest girl in the class, which she was, was told that she could be a teacher but not the principal, that she could be a nurse but not a doctor. Now, nursing and teaching are honorable professions and if a young woman or young man chooses that profession, we should encourage them to do so, but we should educate them that if they choose to be the doctor or the principal or the President, that they have every right to do so. It is important that young women learn that from the word go.My daughters are 6 and 4. They are being educated in their homes to understand that they can go as far as their abilities will take them. But I understand that in the institutions that they will encounter, they will not necessarily receive the same message. They will be paid 69 cents for every dollar that their brothers earn. They will be told that there are still glass ceilings that apply to them but not their boy cousins or brothers. This must change. The first and best place to change it is in America's classrooms, and the best way to change it today is for us to strongly support the retention of this program.I applaud the authors for introducing it.",

    "title": "APPLAUDING THE RECENT ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE ILLINOIS STATE LEGISLATURE REGARDING THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise before you today in strong support of the recent actions taken by the Illinois state legislature regarding the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), a proposed amendment to the Constitution which would unequivocally guarantee equal gender rights under the law. As many of my colleagues are certainly aware, the Illinois State Assembly recently voted on and passed the ERA, clearing the way for their counterparts in the Senate to consider this crucial legislation at the conclusion of their current recess. If Illinois' State Senate agrees to ratify the ERA, then only two more state ratifications will be necessary for this long overdue amendment to be added to our Constitution.Some people have argued that the addition of an ERA amendment to the Constitution would simply be a change in semantics and nothing more. I strongly disagree. Presently, on average, women receive only 76 percent of the pay that men receive for comparable full time positions. Inequities such as these are inexcusable; they are disastrously damaging not just to women, but also to their families. Through the ratification of an Equal Rights Amendment, women would have an expanded legal basis to call for equal compensation for equal work.Although the Equal Rights Amendment may have faded from the public spotlight at times, the movement to include women in the Constitution never died, and it is growing vigorously once again. Women had to wait until 1920 to be granted the right to vote under the Constitution. While this was certainly a monumental development, it has not produced full gender equality. The 14th Amendment, granting ``equal protection of the laws,'' did not, and still does not, fully protect women from damaging gender discrimination. Only an Equal Rights Amendment would ensure the Constitutionally guaranteed full equality that women deserve.The ERA was originally passed by Congress in 1972, along with a seven-year time limit for ratification. In 1979, Congress extended the time limit for three more years, leaving the deadline at 1982. Within a decade of the initial 1972 passage, the amendment had been ratified by 35 states, three short of the necessary 38. For many years after that, the ERA was, for technical reasons, generally considered ``dead.'' However, legal analyses indicate that with just three more state ratifications, the ERA may in fact meet the requirements to be added to the Constitution. As has been verified by several legal experts, the fact that the time limit appears in the proposing clause rather than the text of the legislation leaves this deadline open to adjustment. When Congress chose to extend the deadline in 1979, a precedent was set; subsequent sessions of Congress may adjust time limits placed in proposing clauses by their predecessors. These adjustments may include extensions of time, reductions, or elimination of the deadline altogether.It is therefore possible for current or future sessions of Congress to eliminate the deadline originally placed on ratification of the ERA, thus allowing the amendment to be added to the Constitution once it is ratified by three more states. This ``three state strategy'' is a very real possibility, and I have introduced legislation into the House of Representatives, H. Res. 38, to ensure that action will be immediately considered by Congress once three more state legislatures ratify the Put simply, it is time for the Constitution to be amended to include an amendment which ensures gender equality for all Americans. Today, unlike some times in the past, the American people are decidedly ready for Constitutionally-guaranteed equal rights for men and women. A July 2001 nationwide survey by Opinion Research Corporation showed that 96 percent of American adults believe that male and female citizens of the U.S. should have equal rights, and 88 percent believe that our Constitution should explicitly guarantee those rights. Having the ERA in the Constitution will simply recognize what the American people already want--equal justice under the law.Many leaders both here in Congress and in state legislatures are advocating for the ``three state strategy,'' as well as a renewal of the ERA by Congress through a second passage of the amendment. I feel that anyone who is serious about guaranteeing equal rights to women should be supportive of both of these approaches. It does not matter how the ERA is eventually made part of the Constitution, as long as guaranteed gender equality rights are the end result.As the Equal Rights Amendment reads, ``Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.'' The ERA is unfinished business for the Constitution. It will be achieved, and present and future generations of women--and men--will thank us for it, and wonder why it took so long. It is simple justice, it is long overdue, and it is time.",

    "title": "COMMENDING CLEMSON UNIVERSITY TIGERS MEN'S GOLF TEAM FOR WINNING 2003 NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION DIVISION I MEN'S GOLF CHAMPIONSHIP",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.I rise in support of this resolution, and I commend and congratulate the gentlemen from South Carolina (Mr. Barrett), (Mr. Spratt), (Mr. Clyburn), (Mr. DeMint), (Mr. Brown), and my friend (Mr. Wilson) for their authorship and sponsorship of this resolution. I can understand why the South Carolina delegation is so justifiably proud of the young men who have achieved so much on the links.Among the very most important classrooms, teaching places in our system of our higher education, is the field of athletic competition. There is a reason why we want to encourage colleges and universities around our country to continue educating young men and women on playing fields; and the achievements of the young men of the Clemson University men's golf team are an example of that principle.I must say parenthetically one of the issues that I am proud of is my alma mater, which did not win the NCAA golf tournament, Bucknell University, was recently noted for graduating 100 percent of its student athletes who participate in NCAA sports, and that is an aspiration that I know is shared around the country.These young men of Clemson and these young Tigers had an extraordinary year amidst extraordinarily difficult competition. I am told that they finished the season with a record of 128 wins, eight losses and three draws, or three ties, against opponents ranked in the top 25 teams in the country. So when they took on the very finest competition there was, they won 93 percent of the matches, which is really an astonishingly good record. I wish that I was right 93 percent of the time in the things that I do here in doing my job.We also want to commend the Oklahoma State University Cowboys who were in second place in the tournament. My understanding is that the tournament took place on their home course, and I think that adds special luster to the achievement of the young men from Clemson because when one is playing against competition that is used to playing on that course day in and day out, it is an advantage for the home team that the Clemson team was able to overcome.It is my understanding that each of the Tigers players who participated in the NCAA championship are native-born South Carolinians. That must be a source of great pride for the schools and the coaches and families of the State of South Carolina for which we congratulate those schools and coaches and families.Finally, it is my understanding that players D.J. Trahan, Jack Ferguson, and Matt Hendrix were all honored as All-Americans in the 2002-2003 season. To have three All-Americans on one team in any sport is quite an achievement; and I know that Head Coach Larry Penley, who himself was honored as the Golf Coaches Association of America's Dave Williams Award winner as Coach of the Year, should be justifiably proud.This morning, as we speak, there are young Americans who are in science labs and lecture halls and technology centers and study areas, all in campuses all around our country, and we commend them for that; but we also recognize that one of the most important places to learn about life and about the principles of life is on the field of battle and athletic competitions. It is obvious Clemson University should be very proud of these young men.I also add one thing parenthetically now to inject a controversial topic for those of us, and I mean those of us on both sides of the aisle who so strongly support title IX and support equal athletic opportunities for young men and women. This is one example of how we do not have to choose between broader opportunities for all athletes and broader opportunities for some. One of the concerns about title IX is that nonrevenue-producing sports on the men's side, like golf, which really does not produce revenue, would be jeopardized if we have a strong and robust title IX. Well, we have a strong and robust title IX. We are pleased we are going to keep this, and I think this is one more example of how we can have men and women excel in the field of athletic competition.So I congratulate Clemson University, and all of their alumni and students and followers must be very, very proud of these young men who have won such an esteemed championship.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.",

For Mr. Malcolm Adler, Principal at George Washington, Ms. Ryan serves as an exemplar through which he instills the values of dedication and service in new teachers.There are no plans for retirement in Ms. Ryan's future. Her continued passion and dedication have recently earned her outstanding evaluations from her supervisor and Principal. Ms. Ryan is also well respected by her colleagues at George Washington who last year voted her ``Teacher of the Year.''Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Ms. Wanda Ryan on her dedicated service to the public school system, the George Washington School, the City of Camden, and the 1st Congressional District of New Jersey.",

This bill is for the woman who runs the office, who makes all the important decisions, without whom the place couldn't function; who one day comes in and discovers that a man, usually a man younger than her, has been brought in and given a higher title, a higher pay, and fewer responsibilities. And she goes to work and says, this isn't fair. I'm doing a job that is actually more important than this other person and getting paid less for it.Now it's true that the statutes presently say you have to get equal pay for equal work. But it's also true that the remedies are so limited under existing law that many women can't get an attorney to represent them in their case so it never gets brought.The best idea in this bill is for the first time it gives robust and full remedies to help that woman so that if she is able to prove her claim that she is underpaid relative to the work that she is doing, she will be fully and fairly compensated, and out of that compensation will come the funds to get her the competent representation that she deserves. The woman who's the office manager who doesn't make as much as the executive vice president for administration.Well, I will tell you, in my life, Mr. Chairman, I benefited from a lot of women who are office managers that don't have fancy titles but without whom institutions could not run. This bill is for that woman and for her daughters so that they do not have the situation where they are devalued, debased, degraded, and disrespected in the workplace.It is long overdue that we vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I would urge colleagues on both sides to do that.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, and I would like to address several of the arguments that we have heard against it, first, that this is some bonanza for trial lawyers.What this is is an opportunity for women who have been discriminated against to get a lawyer. If you work as a sales clerk or in a factory, you can't afford to pay a lawyer the hourly fee that he or she needs to represent you. The only way you are going to get represented is through a contingent fee arrangement where a lawyer would recover, would get to keep part of what you recover as part of the deal.Now, the problem with the Equal Pay Act is its remedies are limited so much to just twice what your salary is that the damages are never high enough to justify legal representation. This is about getting lawyers for people who have a valid claim who cannot afford the thousands of dollars that it would be.Second, there was a representation made that defenses are stripped from employers. That's not accurate. What is accurate is that if an employer alleges that some reason other than gender was the reason that he paid the woman less than the man, it has to be a legitimate reason, like level of education or experience. It has to be a legitimate reason. The present law doesn't require that legitimacy.Finally, the statement was made that an employer cannot discharge an employee for talking about pay scales publicly, that's not accurate. What the law does is to say that it protects employees that are custodians and guardians of pay records. But it certainly doesn't restrict in any way an employer's right to enforce a legitimate and realistic company policy.This is a good bill. It's an excellent proposal that will help lift the economic status of women who work very hard, every day, in some cases 7 days a week, and deserve it.I would urge a ``yes'' vote.",

This is the bill for the women who do the work, make the decisions, shoulder the responsibility but don't get the pay.

This makes the promise of the Equal Pay Act a reality for working women around this country.I'm proud that in the 19 years she's served in this body, the author of this bill has fought for this bill; and I say to her, to you, Mr. Speaker, and Americans all over this country, it will become law because of what we're about to do here today.",

    "title": "HONORING RICHARD E. MURRAY, FACHE, FOR HIS SERVICE AS THE PRESIDENT/CEO OF KENNEDY MEMORIAL HEALTH SYSTEM",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Richard E. Murray, FACHE. He has played an integral role in New Jersey's First District through his administration of multiple health care systems. Mr. Murray has demonstrated a history of compassion throughout the community and for this he deserves great praise.Mr. Murray has served as the President/Chief Executive Officer of Kennedy Memorial Health System since 1980. Kennedy Memorial Health System consists of three acute-care hospitals, multiple outpatient clinics and various wellness programs.Mr. Murray's leadership has led to many advances within the Kennedy Memorial Health System. Since 1998, Kennedy Memorial Hospital has opened a free-standing outpatient Dialysis Center, a Sleep Center, a 10-bed Ronald McDonald House Pediatric Unit, a Cancer Center and Outpatient Medical Imaging Center, an Emergency Department, a Center for Wound Healing, a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, a 40-bed Progressive Care Unit, a 12-bed Innovative Hospice Care Center, a Stroke Program, a Maternity Center, a PET/CT Center, a Family Health Services Center, a Maternal-Fetal Medicine Unit, a Surgical Unit, and an Intensive Care Unit.Aside from the structural upgrades, Mr. Murray has overseen multiple projects that have improved the quality of care within the Kennedy Memorial Health System. These projects include the creation of an ``Invensivist Program'' to ensure the oversight of health care providers and patient safety, the purchase of the high-tech DaVinci Robot for use in minimally invasive surgical procedures, and the creation of programs for diabetes control and a smoke free environment at all facilities. Without the hard work and exceptional guidance provided by Mr. Murray, none of these things would have been possible.Mr. Murray has received multiple awards commemorating his service to the South Jersey community. In 2005, he received the New Jersey Hospital Association's Distinguished Service Award, presented annually to an individual with more than 15 years of service in health care who ``consistently demonstrates strength, integrity, professionalism and a relentless commitment to a hospital or health care system.'' In 2006, he was honored by March of Dimes for his positive influence and contribution to the community. In 2007, he was honored with the New Jersey Institute for Nursing EPIC Award, which honors exceptional individuals for their contributions to New Jersey communities and the advancement of health care for the profession of nursing.Madam Speaker, Mr. Murray's service to New Jersey's First Congressional District should not go unrecognized. I want to personally thank Dick Murray for the exceptional guidance he has provided his staff, the community service he has provided to members of the community, and the lives that he has changed throughout New Jersey. I congratulate Mr. Murray and wish him the best of luck in the future.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, there are 15 million unemployed Americans as we meet this afternoon, and this is the 11th consecutive week that the majority has not brought to the floor a bill for us to work together to create an environment where small businesses and entrepreneurs could create jobs for our country.Now, I do agree with the proposition that one of the ways that we could have jobs created by small businesses and entrepreneurs is to improve the country's fiscal standing and give us low long-term interest rates in the long run; and reducing our deficit is a key part of doing that. So I think the issue is not if we reduce spending; it's how we reduce spending.And I do think we should stop sending money to the Brazilian Cotton Institute. I think we shouldn't spend $1.5 billion for the Police Department in Baghdad when American cities are laying police officers off around our country.And I certainly don't think we should be giving $40 billion in subsidies to the oil companies that made $77 billion in profit last year and are raising gasoline to four or five bucks at the pump. I think those are areas we ought to agree on and get this budget done.But 11 consecutive weeks without a bill that helps small businesses and entrepreneurs create jobs is 11 weeks too many.I do, however, Mr. Speaker want to compliment the majority on a good decision I think they've made in this bill. There's an argument in this country about whether to repeal the health care bill or not. We think that would be a surrender to the insurance industry and hurt the American people, and we're against that repeal.And there's an argument in this country about whether Planned Parenthood should continue to get funding for women's health services. Most of us think it should, and many on the other side think it should not.These are legitimate debates. They are not debates that should result in a shutdown of the Federal Government, however. The right thing to do is to agree on the budget and then agree to disagree on repealing the health care bill and funding for Planned Parenthood later down the road.And I would commend the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the chairman of the Rules Committee for putting on the floor this afternoon an extension that does not defund the health care bill, that leaves it in place, and an extension that does not defund Planned Parenthood, that leaves the funding for that in place.I think that's the result that we should have in the long run. I think the budget that we adopt between now and September 30 should continue to fund the health care bill, as this bill does, and should continue to fund Planned Parenthood, as this bill does.But I commend the majority for its decision to leave those issues out of this bill so that these issues are not wrapped up in this.",

    "text": "I thank my friend for yielding.Mr. Speaker, I want to agree with the gentlelady from Illinois who just spoke, who said what the American people want is jobs. I agree with her. And when we assess the record of the new majority on this issue, I think we have to assess that it's found very wanting.This is the 10th week of the new majority. In 10 weeks, they found a way to shut down women's health clinics by defunding Planned Parenthood. They've found a way to essentially repeal 30 years' worth of protections for our drinking water and our air and our land. They've found a way to pass a budget that cuts education, that saps strength and energy from our job creators in this country, but they haven't found one bill, 1 minute, one debate over a plan to work together to create jobs for the American people.I believe, Mr. Speaker, that the American people want Republicans and Democrats to come together and figure out an environment that will encourage entrepreneurs and small businesses to create jobs for our country. The majority has, frankly, done everything but that. And today is yet another bill that I think is a wasted opportunity in that regard.I view today's debate through the eyes of three constituents I interacted with at home this weekend. One was a gentleman who runs a music distribution company. They produce CDs for people who have written and recorded music and don't have a label yet so they can get their music out to the rest of the world. He employs 500 people, and he wants to grow. And in order to grow, he needs people who are facile with various software and other technologies that will help his company grow. He depends upon graduates from our community colleges and our 4-year colleges and universities. And he didn't understand why the majority wants to cut the maximum college scholarship under Pell Grants by $845, thereby taking employees away, conceivably, from him by taking them out of school.It's the homebuilder that I met who really can't call himself a homebuilder anymore because he's not building any homes, and he wonders what we're doing to try to restore faith and confidence to the real estate market so that Americans will feel secure and confident enough to buy a home and put him and his workers back to work. He wonders what we're doing.It was the gentleman I met yesterday who runs a biotech company that has two employees, and he depends on contracts from the National Institutes of Health to do research on various pharmaceutical products. He wants to double the size of his company, put just two more people to work, but he won't hire them as long as the threat of a government shutdown is imminent.This is the wrong bill at the wrong time on the floor.",

    "text": "Madam Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Mink/Woolsey/Sanchez/Morella amendment which restores current gender equity provisions to ensure that girls succeed in school. We need to support gender equity and diversity through all levels of education. For decades, title I has included essential programs to address the gender gap in education. Now arguments have been made that gender inequities no longer warrant our attention. While it is true that girls have made some improvements, the statistics show there are still major gaps in areas such as technology.In our fast-paced global economy, it is essential that girls receive the technology skills to compete successfully.Another continuing problem is inequitable teaching. In 1998, an American Association of University Women report showed that gender inequities still persist in teacher practices. While in most cases teacher biases are unintentional, we need to develop and implement strategies to prevent classroom gender biases. These and other examples show why we must continue to address the need for gender equity in education. We should make this good bipartisan bill better and adopt the Mink amendment.First, this amendment includes provisions to keep pregnant and parenting teenagers in schools. This is one of the most common reasons girls give for dropping out of high school. We should not and cannot turn our back on those who are at risk.Second, the amendment continues to encourage title I schools to meet the educational needs of underserved populations, including girls.Schools should develop strategies to treat boys and girls fairly in the classroom and to encourage girls to pursue higher degrees and careers in math, science, and technology.Finally, this amendment would reauthorize the Women's Educational Equity Act, WEEA, which was enacted in 1974 under the leadership of the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink), to help schools and teachers meet the title IX requirements that prohibit sex discrimination in educational programs that receive Federal funding. WEEA provides resources for teachers and schools seeking equitable education models and methods. Girls all over this country have realized the success of WEEA and other currently working programs; and given the current continuing evidence of the need, we must reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that girls have choices in the future that are not limited by gender; and therefore I urge my colleagues to adopt the Mink/Woolsey/Sanchez/Morella amendment.",
