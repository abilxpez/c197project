    "title": "INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the experiences of Pamela Ferguson-Brey. She is the Honolulu League of Women Voters Human Resource chair and she atteded the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China.In September, 1995, I joined women from around the world at the United Nations Fourth World Conference in China. The Non- Governmental Organization (NGO) conference provided a platform for community organizations from around the world to influence their governments to move more quickly toward equal rights and human rights for women and girls. The NGO forum also provided women from around the world with a forum to highlight issues from their neighborhood, town, city, region, and country and brought participants together to discuss local, national, international solutions to these issues. The NGO conference was an overwhelming experience. From the moment that I first boarded the plane to China and during the conference there was an unspoken acknowledgment, a bond and an excitement between the conference participants. Tens of thousands of women from around the world together for one purpose--to accelerate the movement of governments toward equal human rights for women and girls. While we were strangers and did not all speak the same language or have the same customs, we all shared a unique understanding about our status as women. As women, we know what it means to be denied human rights because of our gender status. As women, we know what is means to be afraid of violence because we are not safe in our streets or in our homes. We know what is means to be denied equal access to reproductive and medical care. We know what is means to be denied a seat at the table when policy decisions are being made about our lives and rights. And we know that in over a dozen counties, through infanticide and dowry deaths, women and girls are killed because of their gender. The bond between women at the conference was also a reflection of the commitment that these thousands of women had to make to realize the changes that are necessary at the local, national and international level to assure that women have equal human rights. At the opening ceremony to the NGO conference NGO participants sang ``I'm going to fight for women's freedom, never turning back, never turning back.'' I think of these words and the conference and I am recommitted and energized to help my own community move forward more quickly toward equal human rights for women and girls.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak against H.R. 3136. My opposition stems not from a desire to prevent the needed increase in the debt limit, nor do I oppose the increase in the Social Security earnings limit contained in section 4, a proposition I supported with my vote in favor of H.R. 2684 last December.Rather, my objection, Mr. Speaker, is to the measure before us, which rests on my adamant opposition to the line-item veto provisions of section 3. The line-item veto is not about money as such. It is about power, specifically the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of the Federal Government. This has nothing to do with Republicans and Democrats. It has nothing to do with the contract except the contract we should be keeping with history that provided for our constitutional democracy to be able to sustain a balance between the executive and the legislative. It assumes that the executive branch, compared to the legislature, is inherently inclined to restrain spending. In fact, however, congressional appropriations have been lower than the amounts requested by the past three Presidents, Democrat and Republican alike. In denying Congress the authority to single out proposed rescissions for individual consideration, H.R. 3136 denies to the Congress an authority it grants to the President.If the President can unilaterally veto individual items in a single bill, why is Congress required to sustain or override those vetoes as an indivisible package? Why is Congress denied the authority, why are we denying ourselves the authority to judge each veto cast by the President? The upshot is more power for the executive branch, less for the legislature. By giving the President power to veto specific tax and appropriation items within a single bill, H.R. 3136 deprives the legislative branch of its share of its ability to strike a compromise with the executive.Mr. Speaker, it upsets the carefully calibrated balance between the legislative and executive branches of Government. That balance is what inclines our political system to compromise. Look at what is happening in the rest of the world where the executive has exclusive authority. I know I am going to be among the few votes that is going to be cast today. What I regret is, and this has happened before in our legislative history, there will be a few who will try to strike a balance to keep the power of the legislature against the executive, and one day there will be a Ph.D. writing a thesis about it, how we gave up our power, how we gave up the balance of power that exists in our democracy. Vote ``no'' on 3136.",

    "title": "RNC GOOFS ON TAX AND SPEND WORK SHEET",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, yesterday, as we know, the tax and spend work sheet went out all over the country. One was sent to my district from the National Republican Congressional Committee.It says here, ``Neil Abercrombie's Tax and Spend Work Sheet.'' The only problem is that they forgot to white out Representative Karen Thurman's name at the bottom. They were using a generic one-size-fits-all work sheet for everybody in the country, and they are so stupid that they put somebody else's name on my work sheet. They do not know the difference between Hawaii and Florida.So when they ask me about taxing and spending, I say, ``I don't know, ask the Republican National Committee. They're the ones that put out Representative Karen Thurman's work sheet for my work sheet.''They say they want to represent the values of the people of the First District of Hawaii. Well, I am in good shape to do that. I do not live in Florida. Why do you not go down to Florida and check with Representative Karen Thurman the next time you want to do that?They told me this campaign was going to be nasty but they did not say it was going to be foolish as well.",

    "title": "CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. 735, ANTITERRORISM AND EFFECTIVE DEATH PENALTY ACT OF 1996",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I ask that this bill be defeated, and I am sorry to say that I have to disagree with my friend from Illinois, Mr. Hyde, on this. I speak to him personally now and request this, a reconsideration with respect to habeas corpus.This past weekend I saw a student production, in an attic in a home in Honolulu, of ``Death and the Maiden,'' Ariel Dorfman's play about Chile. The principal theme was when habeas corpus is absent, there we have authoritarianism and dictatorship. It leads to torture.In Dorfman's essay on political code and literary code, and I am quoting from it:Terror then has a public character. As such it leads to a great ideological operation which authorizes, in the name of Western Christian values, a purifying crusade against the forces of the devil and of the anti-Nation.He goes on to say:The principal obsession of authoritarian politics is to suppress history and those who could modify it, postulating an unchangeable and superior reality, God, father, and family, to which one owes loyalty.This is the difficulty. If we abandon habeas corpus, we abandon one of the foundation stones of the United States of America.You have heard me on this floor expound before on the right to a trial, the right to be able to vote freely, the right to sue, and the fourth leg of that foundation is habeas corpus, the right to be brought before a Federal court to say that your rights have been violated. If we take that away, then we are succumbing to terrorism. We are terrorizing the Constitution.The time lapses. But the Constitution goes on. I ask, please, Mr. Hyde, reconsideration on the habeas corpus part of this bill, and then perhaps we could vote on the terrorist bill with full meaning.",
