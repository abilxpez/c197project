    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the experiences of Pamela Ferguson-Brey. She is the Honolulu League of Women Voters Human Resource chair and she atteded the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China.In September, 1995, I joined women from around the world at the United Nations Fourth World Conference in China. The Non- Governmental Organization (NGO) conference provided a platform for community organizations from around the world to influence their governments to move more quickly toward equal rights and human rights for women and girls. The NGO forum also provided women from around the world with a forum to highlight issues from their neighborhood, town, city, region, and country and brought participants together to discuss local, national, international solutions to these issues. The NGO conference was an overwhelming experience. From the moment that I first boarded the plane to China and during the conference there was an unspoken acknowledgment, a bond and an excitement between the conference participants. Tens of thousands of women from around the world together for one purpose--to accelerate the movement of governments toward equal human rights for women and girls. While we were strangers and did not all speak the same language or have the same customs, we all shared a unique understanding about our status as women. As women, we know what it means to be denied human rights because of our gender status. As women, we know what is means to be afraid of violence because we are not safe in our streets or in our homes. We know what is means to be denied equal access to reproductive and medical care. We know what is means to be denied a seat at the table when policy decisions are being made about our lives and rights. And we know that in over a dozen counties, through infanticide and dowry deaths, women and girls are killed because of their gender. The bond between women at the conference was also a reflection of the commitment that these thousands of women had to make to realize the changes that are necessary at the local, national and international level to assure that women have equal human rights. At the opening ceremony to the NGO conference NGO participants sang ``I'm going to fight for women's freedom, never turning back, never turning back.'' I think of these words and the conference and I am recommitted and energized to help my own community move forward more quickly toward equal human rights for women and girls.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak against H.R. 3136. My opposition stems not from a desire to prevent the needed increase in the debt limit, nor do I oppose the increase in the Social Security earnings limit contained in section 4, a proposition I supported with my vote in favor of H.R. 2684 last December.Rather, my objection, Mr. Speaker, is to the measure before us, which rests on my adamant opposition to the line-item veto provisions of section 3. The line-item veto is not about money as such. It is about power, specifically the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of the Federal Government. This has nothing to do with Republicans and Democrats. It has nothing to do with the contract except the contract we should be keeping with history that provided for our constitutional democracy to be able to sustain a balance between the executive and the legislative. It assumes that the executive branch, compared to the legislature, is inherently inclined to restrain spending. In fact, however, congressional appropriations have been lower than the amounts requested by the past three Presidents, Democrat and Republican alike. In denying Congress the authority to single out proposed rescissions for individual consideration, H.R. 3136 denies to the Congress an authority it grants to the President.If the President can unilaterally veto individual items in a single bill, why is Congress required to sustain or override those vetoes as an indivisible package? Why is Congress denied the authority, why are we denying ourselves the authority to judge each veto cast by the President? The upshot is more power for the executive branch, less for the legislature. By giving the President power to veto specific tax and appropriation items within a single bill, H.R. 3136 deprives the legislative branch of its share of its ability to strike a compromise with the executive.Mr. Speaker, it upsets the carefully calibrated balance between the legislative and executive branches of Government. That balance is what inclines our political system to compromise. Look at what is happening in the rest of the world where the executive has exclusive authority. I know I am going to be among the few votes that is going to be cast today. What I regret is, and this has happened before in our legislative history, there will be a few who will try to strike a balance to keep the power of the legislature against the executive, and one day there will be a Ph.D. writing a thesis about it, how we gave up our power, how we gave up the balance of power that exists in our democracy. Vote ``no'' on 3136.",

They do not know the difference between Hawaii and Florida.So when they ask me about taxing and spending, I say, ``I don't know, ask the Republican National Committee. They're the ones that put out Representative Karen Thurman's work sheet for my work sheet.''They say they want to represent the values of the people of the First District of Hawaii. Well, I am in good shape to do that. I do not live in Florida.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I ask that this bill be defeated, and I am sorry to say that I have to disagree with my friend from Illinois, Mr. Hyde, on this. I speak to him personally now and request this, a reconsideration with respect to habeas corpus.This past weekend I saw a student production, in an attic in a home in Honolulu, of ``Death and the Maiden,'' Ariel Dorfman's play about Chile. The principal theme was when habeas corpus is absent, there we have authoritarianism and dictatorship. It leads to torture.In Dorfman's essay on political code and literary code, and I am quoting from it:Terror then has a public character. As such it leads to a great ideological operation which authorizes, in the name of Western Christian values, a purifying crusade against the forces of the devil and of the anti-Nation.He goes on to say:The principal obsession of authoritarian politics is to suppress history and those who could modify it, postulating an unchangeable and superior reality, God, father, and family, to which one owes loyalty.This is the difficulty. If we abandon habeas corpus, we abandon one of the foundation stones of the United States of America.You have heard me on this floor expound before on the right to a trial, the right to be able to vote freely, the right to sue, and the fourth leg of that foundation is habeas corpus, the right to be brought before a Federal court to say that your rights have been violated. If we take that away, then we are succumbing to terrorism. We are terrorizing the Constitution.The time lapses. But the Constitution goes on. I ask, please, Mr. Hyde, reconsideration on the habeas corpus part of this bill, and then perhaps we could vote on the terrorist bill with full meaning.",

    "title": "GROUNDS FOR OPPOSITION TO THE ANTITERRORISM BILL",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I want to elaborate, if I might, on the remarks that I made with respect to the so-called antiterrorism bill earlier. As members know, we are constrained by time in our remarks, and by having 5 minutes today, perhaps I can make a little more clear or elaborate a bit on what the grounds were for my opposition.Mr. Speaker, let me quote in part from a story written in today's Washington Post, as follows, excerpting from the story:It marks the first time in more than a century of law on the writ of habeas corpus that Federal judges would have to defer to State court determinations on whether a prisoner's constitutional rights were violated. A writ of habeas corpus is a way for Federal judges to assess whether a defendant's conviction is unconstitutional because, for example, his right to a fair trial was infringed. The writ orders the State to produce the prisoner, the body, or the corpus, so that he can make his case to a Federal court.Mr. Speaker, I had indicated in my previous remarks that this past weekend my wife and I attended a play, were observers at a play that was given in Honolulu in a very small venue. I do not think there were 20 people there, mostly students. It was a student production, student-directed. The set was very simple. There are only three characters, if you will. The play was called ``Death and the Maiden.'' It comes from a work by Schubert and is a beautiful piece, orchestral piece. Death and the Maiden was played by a doctor who is a participant in torture in an unnamed Latin American country. He plays the symphonic piece as he tortures people, to torment them.In the play, a lawyer who has been named to a commission to examine what has happened in the country previously with respect to those who have been arrested and tortured and killed, disappeared, indicates that the reason that the regime was able to accomplish this in the first place was the abandonment of habeas corpus; that is to say, the capacity of the individual to be able to take a case to a Federal judge, in the context of the United States, to ask that judge to determine whether or not he or she is being fairly held.As my good friend from California, Mr. Miller, said to me just very recently in discussion about these remarks and positions on the bill, the loss of our rights and our privileges do not come in grand sweeps. They come by degree, they come by circumstances that are deemed at the moment more than sufficient to erode that particular right.And so I asked friends at the Library of Congress to provide for me a copy of the playwright's essays. Ariel Dorfman, the Chilean writer, is the author of the play ``Death and the Maiden,'' and he was written a book of essays or compiled a book of his essays called ``Some Write to the Future.'' I recommend it to the Speaker and to others who are concerned about this. I realize it was an agonizing vote for many.But in the process of commenting on Chile, the country from which Mr. Dorfman comes, he wrote an essay once called the Political Code and the Literary Code, the testimonial genre in Chile today.In it he says, in that essay:Terror, then, has a public character. As such, it leads to a great ideological operation, which authorizes, in the name of Western, Christian values, a purifying crusade against the forces of the Devil and of the antination. The principal obsession of authoritarian politics is to suppress history and those who could modify it, postulating an unchangeable and superior reality, God, fatherland, family, to which one owes loyalty. What is paradoxical about this ideological framework is that it excuses a repression that, in fact, is never admitted by official channels. Memory of the suffering must survive in gossip, in rumor, in the whispering of what they did, and even in official threats, but at the same time, in each concrete case, in each undeniable and undocumented case, with damaged teeth, genitals, and ribs, in spite of each relative's identification, in spite of the cries of pain, the truth of the violence is denied. The people are punished, but in the long run the relationship is made benevolently and paternally innocent, translating it into terms that are almost familial and intimate: expulsion and exclusion of the wayward, the recalcitrant, the disturbers of public order; reintegration, of the misguided and the repentant. Neo- colonial fascism takes the bourgeois dream to its totalitarian culmination.Mr. Speaker, in that context we see, then, that to eliminate habeas corpus does damage to the Constitution beyond repair.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, if the gentlewoman will yield, it might be of interest in the context that you have just established in regard to the minimum wage to note that the State of Hawaii already has a minimum wage at $5.25. We were an economy in Hawaii based on agriculture. We have moved into one of the most service-oriented economies it is possible to have; that is to say, a dependence on travel and tourism.Yet the argument is always made that if you are in a service economy, you have to keep wages at an absolute minimum. If you are in an agriculture economy, you have to keep wages at an absolute minimum. Yet the prosperity of the State of Hawaii has been based upon the fact that we recognized that people who are working, families that have to work, are best able not just to survive, but to prosper, when they are able to earn more than just a living wage, more than just an adequate wage, but a wage which enables them to fully participate in the economy.That economy is invested in by the very people who are doing the work. The money stays in the area where it is earned. It is not taken by multinational companies, by international companies, elsewhere. It is not moved into a global economy as such.That money earned in that State, whether it is Connecticut, whether it is in Hawaii, whether it is anyplace, whether it is in Georgia, in Cobb County, in Mr. Gingrich's home district, that money stays in that district. That money is invested in that district. Small business people make money in that district as a result of it.Those kinds of wages, the minimum wage, in service oriented jobs, when it is earned, is spent in the clothing store to buy shoes for the children right there in the local community. That is where it goes. The small investor, the small businesses, are the direct beneficiary of the raise in the minimum wage.",

    "title": "WAIHEE MARSH INCLUSION IN OAHU NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE COMPLEX",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for H.R. 1772, to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire certain interests in the Waihe'e Marsh for inclusion in the Oahu National Wildlife Refuge, introduced by my colleague from Hawaii, Representative Patsy Mink.The Waihe'e Marsh, also called the Kahalu'u wetland, is located on the windward side of Oahu. Acquisition of Waihe'e Marsh is vital to the integrity of the Oahu National Wildlife Refuge [Refuge]. The purpose of the refuge is to protect and manage a network of wetlands throughout Oahu for the recovery of endangered waterbirds, migratory birds, and other values of natural wetlands. Specifically, Waihe'e Marsh is identified as a priority wetland site in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's regional wetlands concept plan: Emergency Wetlands Resource Act [USFWS 1990]. Throughout Hawaii there has been a substantial cumulative loss of wetlands.I would like to point out to my colleagues in the House that the natural environment of Hawaii is one of our planet's most significant treasures. The islands are home to more unique species than any place of similar size on the Earth. Yet, Hawaii has the most alarming concentration of species teetering on the brink of extinction. While Hawaii makes up only 0.2 percent of the land area we account for nearly 75 percent of the Nation's historically documented plant and bird extinctions of the United States. Currently, more than one-fourth of the 959 animals and plants on the U.S. endangered and threatened species list come from Hawaii.Under H.R. 1772 Waihe'e Marsh would be rehabilitated and managed for the recovery and support of endangered Hawaiian waterbirds, such as the endangered Hawaiian Stilt, Hawaiian coot, Hawaiian moorhen and Hawaiian duck, which are all protected under the Endangered Species Act. Also, wetlands in Hawaii provide habitat for several species of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl which are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.I want to mention to my colleagues that the importance of Waihe'e Marsh is not limited to plants and animals. This has been an issue that has been worked from the grassroots. I commend all the hard work put in by the local communities. The Waihe'e Marsh is important for the surrounding communities because it naturally serves as a flood control holding area and the vegetation contributes to the control of shoreline erosion for nearby residential areas. Also, the marsh serves as a filter to protect water quality and coral reef communities in Kaneohe Bay.Mr. Speaker, this is a worthwhile piece of legislation that deserves the full support of all my colleagues.",

    "title": "HELIUM PRIVATIZATION ACT OF 1996",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise with regrets, acknowledging H.R. 3008, a bill to close the Federal helium program, will pass today. In these days of downsizing, it seems the time has come to terminate programs which appear to have outlived their usefulness like the Federal helium program.I want to note that I say appear, Mr. Speaker. Since 1925, when the Defense Department believed that dirigibles or blimps would be an integral part of our national defense, the Federal Government has managed a helium program. Today the Federal helium program continues to serve the needs of major Federal users of helium such as NASA and DOE laboratories, who are required to purchase helium from the Bureau of Mines.The Federal Government got involved in helium production at a time when there was no private helium production. Today, however, the private sector manufactures 90 percent of the world's helium. For this reason groups such as the National Taxpayers Union, the ``20/20'' TV program, the Interior Department inspector general, and the Heritage Foundation, an unlikely conglomeration, have called for its elimination.H.R. 3008, like its predecessor, H.R. 3967 in the 103d Congress, enjoys bipartisan support. While I did not support termination of the program, I recognize after several years of consideration Congress is poised to resolve the question of the helium program by terminating it. But I remain concerned that we have not done enough to aid the 200-plus employees in Amarillo, TX, who will lose their livelihood as consequence of our decision.The bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to sell off all the equipment, real property, refining facilities, and gradually sell off most of the crude helium currently stored in Amarillo, TX. Funds from the sale will be deposited in a helium fund established under the 1960 act, and will be available for various termination activities, including some employee benefits already authorized under law. Eventually the fund will be applied against the debt to reduce the deficit. This is, in any event, the hope.During the committee consideration of this bill, I offered an amendment to provide employee benefits in addition to those authorized under existing law so that the 200-plus employees in Amarillo, many of whom have built their careers on this program, would get the same kind of additional education and job placement assistance that we gave defense employees working at bases that were closed. These are people, Mr. Speaker, men and women, who through no fault of their own find themselves working for a Federal program targeted for downsizing and in fact elimination.My amendment would have given these people help in addition to what the Secretary has already authorized to provide, the same kind of help that we have provided, as I indicated, to many of the defense employees working at military bases scheduled for closure: job placement assistance, extended life and health insurance coverage, and the option to take an early retirement without penalty.Sadly, my Republican colleagues on the committee could not be persuaded to provide this type of much-needed aid. During committee debate, my friend and colleague from California [Mr. Calvert] argued that the Secretary already has the authority to provide these benefits. This is simply incorrect, Mr. Speaker.My amendment would have added authority necessary to enable the Secretary to extend health and life insurance coverage for 3 years beyond an employee's termination. The Secretary does not have the ability to provide this assistance under current law. My amendment would have allowed Federal helium employees access to the enhanced early retirement option, and current law does not provide for this protection. My amendment would have given Federal helium employees hiring preference Government-wide, not just in the Amarillo area as is provided under existing law.So, Mr. Speaker, my amendment failed. Even though I agreed with my good friend and colleague from Texas [Mr. Thornberry] that we did not need to terminate this program, I, and I believe he, could see that this bill would pass. So I tried to lessen the blow so that the helium workers might be able to find another Federal job, or if they served 20 years, they could take an early out and retire from civil service.As of now, this is not to be, Mr. Speaker. These activities would have been paid from the existing helium account and would have cost relatively pennies, especially in comparison to the costs of unemployment benefits. The Congressional Budget Office said that my amendment would have had no budgetary effect.It seemed only fair to offer this assistance to the innocent victims of our downsizing zeal, so that the employees who had nothing to do with the difficulties facing the program would not be left stranded by their Government. But my Republican colleagues could not see their way clear to help their fellow public servants in this instance, and so today I expect we will pass H.R. 3008 under suspension of the rules so we can praise ourselves for making Government smaller.We could have done so, Mr. Speaker, in a much more humane and compassionate manner. I will ask the other body to consider my amendment before we conclude the legislative process. Loyal workers in the helium program deserve no less.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

In this particular instance, we are talking about quality of life, and I would like to follow then on the remarks of the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Hefner] as well.Unfortunately, the Department of Defense has come to rely upon us in Congress when it comes to budgetary matters with respect to quality of life. What happens is, on the procurement side, in the more exotic weapons systems, particularly those that cost a great deal of money, they push that part of the envelope right up to the edge, and then they count on Members of Congress to come through on questions of quality of life, whether it is barracks or family housing or what have you, child development centers, et cetera. And we have done that.I want to commend the gentleman from Colorado [Mr. Hefley] for his bipartisan approach on it, the chair of the subcommittee; and my good friend from North Carolina [Mr. Hefner] for seeing to it that these quality of life issues have not been abandoned.In particular, I can say in the area of the Pacific, we have dealt with Schofield Barracks and the renewal of barracks there, and we are very appreciative, and this year at Kaneohe for the Marine Barracks. General Krulak, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, called very, very happy to see that we were going to start the phasing in of the new barracks proposals at Kaneohe in the State of Hawaii.I will say that this has a further good effect. What this does is stop the competition for nonexistent rental housing between military families and civilian families. The result, the 6 years that I have been in office and the plan that I started out with and presented on a bipartisan basis, was that this would reduce rents, reduce the cost of living in Hawaii for civilian families and improve the quality of life for military families, I think a good result from that, and I am very grateful for it.I have two other points that I would like to make very briefly. One, as a way of improving this, I hope and I think the gentleman from Colorado [Mr. Hefley] has indicated that he has an interest in this, and other Republican members on our authorizing committee have indicated an interest in this, is that we start thinking about capital budgeting and start differentiating operating costs from capital costs, particularly using as a demonstration model perhaps quality of life issues in the military. We have started that.The gentleman from Colorado [Mr. Hefley] was instrumental in helping us put together legislation for public-private partnerships to see to it that we can get into capital expenditures. If we can differentiate capital expenditures from operating expenditures, I think we can make vast improvements in the quality of life area and demonstrate a way of moving toward more sensible spending patterns that will result not only in helping to balance the budget but in moving forward in a sensible way with our military budgeting.So I am appreciative to the gentleman from Colorado [Mr. Hefley], the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Hefner], to the gentlewoman from Nevada [Mrs. Vucanovich], and others who have helped support this issue.Finally, Mr. Chairman, let me say that when I was first elected in a special election in 1986, there was someone here who took me under his wing, that acted as a mentor to me, someone whom I believe to be an example of the true gentleman that exists in the House of Representatives, someone who will be more than missed, someone for whom I have the greatest possible respect, someone that we know and military families throughout the country will appreciate for decades to come because of his work at Fort DeRussy and Hale Koa to see that the recreation needs of our military are taken care of. All of us are going to miss with all of our hearts Representative Sonny Montgomery from Mississippi.",

I indicated in that discussion that I had in conjunction with the Congressional Record in 1996 that there was no such thing as a balanced budget being prepared, let alone put forward in 1996, and we have the same situation today.Mr. Speaker, I do not doubt that it is very important for Mr. Dole to resign from the Senate to run as citizen and/or candidate Dole, because I do not think that in his role as Senator, let alone majority leader, that he would have the opportunity to have much credibility in the way of putting forward a balanced budget amendment, let alone putting forward a balanced budget for 1997.My fundamental point, Mr. Speaker, is that the budget that will be presented to us shortly, possibly this week, and be dispatched as quickly as possible, as opposed to 1996, dispatched as quickly as possible because it is not a balanced budget.Now, my good friend, my good and dear friend I would say, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Kasich], will come down, and he is an engaging individual. When I state my affection and friendship for him, Mr. Speaker, you know that it is a feeling that is genuine on my part. I value his friendship and I have genuine affection for him as an individual, but he has an impossible task. I grant he is probably the best one to try to put it forward.As you know, Mr. Speaker, he is an avuncular person, even as yourself, and he will come down on the floor, and with his engaging smile and his wit and rhetoric, we will put the best possible face on the fact that this is not a balanced budget document. It is not balanced for 1997, it most certainly is not going to be balanced for the year 2002.The reason I am taking the special order time, Mr. Speaker, with the budget, is that given the rules of the House it is virtually impossible to have any kind of lengthy discussion that would illuminate for the public and for the Members exactly what the budget is all about. Most of this takes place in a hearing room, in the Committee on the Budget hearings, and in staff work that is being done, discussions between the House and the other body with respect to a conference on the budget. Suffice to say, and I will for the Record, and would be happy to engage, as I did previously when we discussed the 1996 budget, be happy to engage anyone from the Republican side or from the Democratic side, because the budget being prepared from the Democratic side does not balance either. The difference is that we can count, I can count.As you know, Mr. Speaker, I would like to see the budget deficit disappear, but I think we should take a much longer period of time to do it so that we do not endanger the economy. I think that, interestingly enough, considering the labels that are put out about liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans or conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans, whatever these labels are, that I think the Federal Reserve, Mr. Greenspan's approach has been that the economy should be prevented from slipping into either recession or depression or slipping into a phase of inflation or hyperinflation. I think the stock market reflects this.The fact is that the growth in the economy is such that with a judicious approach to deficit cutting, we could keep the economy robust and reduce the deficit. This is, in fact, what President Clinton has accomplished. I know this is a source of great distress to those who predicted disaster with the Clinton budget, as presented in 1992 and 1993, but the fact is that the deficit has been cut considerably both in percentage terms and in real dollars for 3 years running now, something which has not happened since the end of World War II.So the President, not having the benefit of a Congress which is supportive of him in the majority; that is to say, a Republican Congress before him, has accepted the admonition of the majority to utilize the Congressional Budget Office figures in order to present to the public the idea of what would constitute numbers sufficient to have a balanced budget.In that role; that is to say, of a President who is faced with a Congress that wants to balance the budget utilizing the Congressional Budget Office figures, he accepted that ultimately in 1996. His priorities were different. As a result of the priorities within those priorities were, the President vetoed various elements of the budget and the budget was ultimately settled in a series of confrontations, a series of recriminations and arguments back and forth as to who was doing what and why.In the course of events, the Government was closed on various occasions and generally it was seen as a kind of sorry affair all the way around. Nonetheless, my point here is recounting that today is that we will not see that again, apparently, in 1997. We will go through the same series of illusions, using somewhat different numbers, but we will come to a much more rapid conclusion. The reason we will come to the more rapid conclusion is that we will not have the opportunity this year to go through--if the gentleman from Michigan would step to the microphone, I will be happy to yield at an appropriate point.Mr. Speaker, if Mr. Smith will grant me just a moment or two more to make the fundamental of my case, then I will be happy to yield to him. Always a pleasure to see him. In fact, he was one of the few people, as I mentioned previously, Mr. Speaker, who was willing to engage in a dialog and a colloquy on the question of the budget, and I value his input and exchange.As I indicated, Mr. Speaker, in 1996, if you will recall, we went through weeks actually, not just hours or days of discussion but weeks of discussion, and in the course of that discussion I was on the floor reviewing the budget, and I will do so again for 1997. My fundamental premise is this, that just as there was only the illusion of a balanced budget proposal, whether single year or multiyear, in 1996, there will be only the illusion presented this year. It will be strictly for political consumption and will not amount to anything worth the paper that it is written on in such elaborate fashion.I have here, Mr. Speaker, in my hand, and I will not have extensive charts down on the floor, I think the report speaks for itself, it is the concurrent resolution on the budget, fiscal year 1997, a report of the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives to accompany the Congressional Resolution 178 setting forth the congressional budget of the United States Government for the fiscal years 1997 through 2002, and it has additional minority and dissenting views.Now, this document runs some 450-plus pagers, 455 pages or so, and it is a very interesting document. It takes 44 pages, which is the first 44, takes 44 pages to get to the actual budget, when we actually get to the fiscal year budget for 1997. It is preceded on the page 43 with the end of politics as usual. This, I take it, is not exactly an attempt at humor on the part of the Committee on the Budget, the Committee on the Budget not being known for its sense of humor, other than in the person of, as I said, the aforementioned chair of the Committee on the Budget, but in the end of politics as usual, functions by function description, it says, ``The discussions that follow describe the budget resolution's recommended priorities for the fiscal years 1997 through 2002.''Now, it took us 44 pages to get there. We went through everything, including attacking corporate subsidies, economic assumptions of the budget resolution, the Clinton crunch, Americans' anxiety about their economic future, quite a rhetorical set-to in the first 44 pages. But what do we have then on page 44?Well, it says at the end of each function, ``Additional provisions with budgetary effects are mentioned.'' Mentioned, Mr. Speaker. I am going to get into a little more detail. The discussions that follow reflect the assumptions underlying the House Committee on the Budget's recommendations concerning the funding priorities for programs in each function.The actual changes for the programs fall under the authority of the authorizing and appropriating committees with jurisdiction over the programs.Let me explain very briefly, for those Members who may not be fully familiar with the budget process and those members of the public which may follow the Congressional Record on this who may not be totally familiar with it, once the Committee on the Budget makes its recommendations, it provides through that recommendation a kind of game plan for us in the House and the other body, a game plan for the Congress.Then the various committees in the Congress, whether they are authorizing committees or whether they are appropriating committees, authorizing meaning the program committees, the subject matter committees, and the Committee on Appropriations and its subcommittees, those who provide the money for the functions that are approved and authorized, they put the actual numbers and programs behind the Committee on the Budget recommendations.So with that in mind, what do we get to? We hear from Mr. Dole, Mr. Clinton, Mr. Kasich, Mr. Sabo, heartfelt and I will say totally sincere admonitions to us to arrive at a balanced budget. Well, as I indicated, I think that can be done. I think it will take a lot longer period than 1997 to 2002, and I need only look at the actual budget document itself to come up with proof of that.Let us examine what it actually says on page 44 of the budget resolution. Fiscal year 1997 through 2002, the deficit starting in 1997 will be--and these are estimates, they could go up or down. We realize that, but this is the best guess. And it is an informed guess by the Committee on the Budget and utilizing the congressional budget figures, and I take them at their word on this. And for conversation's sake, I will agree that these are the numbers that are under discussion and upon which we will vote--$163 billion deficit in 1995; 1996, it was $150 billion. The 1995 figure was down from the figures previous to that. You may recall during the last years of Mr. Bush's administration, the figures were 250 and above, between 250 and 300 billion. The number 163 then was progress. It may be too high for some people but unless you want to literally amputate the economy in order to achieve a balanced budget, this is certainly within the range of acceptability. It certainly has been reflected, that acceptability has been reflected in the conservative bodies, if you will, of financial opinion in this country as manifested in the policies of the Federal Reserve and the response of the stock exchange. So we had 163 billion, down considerably from the 250 to 290 billion plus of previous years; 1996, 150; 1997, the estimate is 147.This is a deficit I am citing. It is not something I am making up. I am taking this directly from page 44 under the column line deficit/surplus. Either it is a deficit or a surplus. This is the deficit. We get deficits in 1998, 1999, the year 2000, 2001, going from 147 to 142 to 114 to 87 to 39, certainly progress, then suddenly, as if by magic, Mr. Speaker, in the year 2002, we get a plus 3 billion, $3.185 billion.To me it is like watching a television show I saw recently, I think it was called the Wonderful World of Magic. This is the wonderful world of congressional budgeting. When someone is sawed in half, I saw this again, that is one of the oldest tricks, sawing a, generally a young woman in half, we do not really saw her in half. You have the illusion of her being sawed in half. She waves from one end, and the box is split in half and the feet are wiggling at the other end. Then the box is brought back together again and magically she reappears. That knife that went through that body apparently was an illusion.Well, the deficit cutting knife that is going through the deficit here between the years 1997 and 2002 is an illusion. Because suddenly, she is whole, the budget is whole, the budget has been balanced in 2002. Yet what happens then between 1997 and the year 2002, we have had an accumulated deficit of 528 billion. But magically, after that 528 billion in increasing deficit has occurred, suddenly, 528 billion later we achieve a $3 billion surplus for that 1 year. After that the deficit explodes again.Mr. Speaker, surely you can see and surely Members can see and surely the public, upon reading this document, will see that this is a game that is being played, a ballet with the books, a budget that is in name, a budget balancing act which is in name only, an act, yes, but certainly not balanced.I see the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Smith] has taken the rostrum down on the floor and I presume would like to have some discussion. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.",

    "text": "You and I may not be here after today. Although I must say that this does show, I think, that this is not so much a question of majority versus minority. It is a question of whether you want to be honest about it.My defense, if you will, of the President's approach under this is that the President has accepted, and I will say in good faith, the congressional budget numbers as offered by the majority. His difference comes in this, in how he prioritizes the spending changes. We can argue that and I think we should argue it a lot more.My fear is, and what I said earlier today was, because it is so difficult to understand terms like out years and whether a surplus is really a surplus and those kinds of things, because it is so difficult, the majority, I am given to understand, intends to put forward the budget and the amount of discussion that is going to take place about the budget, such as you and I are having right now, will be minimized. In fact, it will be virtually nonexistent. From what I can gather, both sides are apparently quite content to do that. Although I would welcome the opportunity, if Mr. Solomon and the Committee on Rules would agree, to open up the budget for 3 or 4 or 5 days' review.",

    "text": "I not only agree, but I think we should have an extensive discussion as to what exactly constitutes welfare, what exactly constitutes discretionary spending, what programs should we have and not have.For example, my understanding is that the Speaker, for some reason unknown to me, is proposing a defense act or bill which revolves around national missile defense. Now, I would say, and I would hope you would agree, that the majority has not only very able, but extremely well-informed, experienced legislators on the Committee on National Security, of whom I can name two or three right now: Mr. Weldon, Mr. Hunter, and Mr. Cunningham. I can th1nk of just three offhand. And the minority has people like Mr. Spratt.Mr. Dellums, others I could name, Mr. Peterson of Florida, who are equally capable, and equally capable, by the way, of defending and rebutting on the question of national missile defense.But the Speaker has said he wants to bring forward a missile bill. Now, I do not think the Speaker knows any more about missiles than he knows about Hawaiian malasadas, and I do not think he knows much about malasadas, and I will spell that after this is over, but take it from me, it is a Portuguese donut, and I do not think he knows much about it. I think Leonard's knows all about it out in Honolulu.But that budget, if we are going to talk about spending and welfare, has to be looked at very hard. The Congressional Budget Office, as I understand it, came up with figures just to acquire this defense system, missile system, national missile defense, of between $30 and $60 billion. Now, that is a serious question; and we cannot hide behind the idea that somehow, if you are for it, you are for defense, if you are against it, you are against defense, when you have to put it in terms of what constitutes proper spending under the admonitions that you just enunciated.",

That deserves a discussion.I am not saying necessarily a lengthy discussion, but it certainly deserves a discussion in depth, and perhaps the gentleman could indicate whether my understanding is correct, that the intention of the majority, the intention of the majority leader and the Committee on Rules is to dispatch this budget within a day or so of our discussion today.",

    "text": "Thank you very much. I appreciate it.As usual, Mr. Smith has been very forthright in his presentation, and I am appreciative of that. However, I would hope, Mr. Speaker, that you would consider what has been said during this colloquy, which I hope was at least informative, if not illuminating, and in the process then think about what Mr. Smith said.We know what he would prefer. He would prefer the deficit to disappear more quickly, and the reason that I find the notion amusing is I would prefer to be able to dunk a basketball, but I probably would have to pay a lot more in taxes. But I do not think that is going to happen. I mean it is an interesting thing to think about. In fact, I thought about it a lot in my life. I look at that basket up there, and I think, you know, it would be interesting to be able to dunk the ball. But it is a fantasy, and the difference between, I think, a sane person and someone who is steeped in illusion is to know the difference between fantasy and reality.It is a fantasy, and by Mr. Smith's own calculations it is a fantasy, to believe that we are really going to balance the budget in 5 years' time, or 7 years' time, because we have not taken into account where we borrowed the money to be able to put the numbers on the page to pretend that we were balancing the budget. Or we have imagined savings that somehow are going to take place like a balloon payment.You notice I mentioned the phrase balloon payment because I think that is as close as the average person would come to be able to relate their own budget, say their own mortgage, to what is taking place here in the Congress.I take no pleasure in going through this. On the contrary. I am glad Mr. Smith was down here so that it does not look at if it is just something I am conjuring up in order to take up time or to try and make some remarks that can be seen as very smart and sophisticated and dismissive of the genuine problem that exists with respect to the deficit. On the contrary. I would take what Mr. Smith said very much to heart.If you recall, if I recall correctly, he stated something: We should do it more gradually. Well, say 7 years was gradually to him. Well, maybe it would take 17. After all, we take 30 years to pay a mortgage on a home. In many instances we take 5 or 6 years to pay a car, we take some months or even years to pay off an appliance. It seems to me that if we are talking about the economic stability of the United States of America, to put a 30-year timetable or a 15-year timetable on paying down our deficit so that our economy stays stable, in fact stays robust and growing, that inflation stays in check, and interest rates remain low, and confidence high, that that would be an excellent use of our time vis-a-vis the growth capacity and possibilities of the U.S. economy.So there is no need to go through this kind of a charade with the budget unless we are trying to score political points and not deal realistically with the question of the budget and balancing it.Let me further state then at this point a subject that we got into very briefly; that is to say Mr. Smith and I got into it very briefly: How do you balance the budget when you are borrowing against Social Security, the so-called surplus in Social Security? And parenthetically, Mr. Speaker, let me say that that is not really a surplus. What we are doing now is what the average person thinks about when they put their savings together. They save now in order to be able to draw upon it in the future when it is needed.Now, the rough parallel to that is the Social Security System. We are paying into Social Security more than we take out presently because we know that in the future those funds will be called upon to be paid out. More people will be drawing upon Social Security with less people paying into it, we will have to make adjustments at some point in order to take that into account. Now, presumably the economy will grow, the percentage that may be taken in your Social Security tax, your payroll tax, et cetera, may increase in absolute numbers because the economy grows.All of those things can be guessed at, taken into account, but nonetheless the general proposition is, is that the Social Security trust fund must take in more money than it pays out as it goes along in order to be able to meet the requirements that Social Security will have to meet sometime in the next century in the early part of the century.If that is the case, and we are borrowing from Social Security trust fund and other trust funds, principally Social Security, if we are borrowing from them and have no plan to pay it back, because I think Mr. Smith agreed that nowhere in the 1997 budget projections through the next 5 years is there a plan to pay back Social Security, now, Mr. Speaker, if you and I borrowed money from ourselves and had no plan to pay it back, I do not think either of us would feel that that money somehow would magically appear in the year 2002.All that being said, Mr. Speaker, the borrowing, the deficit rising, no plan to pay it back to the Social Security System, how then is it possible to claim that the budget will be balanced in 2002? How is that possible and at the same time have a tax cut that will take revenues out of the system?Does it not make sense to you, Mr. Speaker, that if you are borrowing money in order in order to mask a deficit, that if you have a tax cut, which in fact increases the amount of money that will not be going to the Treasury, in addition to what you are borrowing, you are actually increasing the deficit? you are actually increasing the deficit even more.This is why I oppose this idea of cutting taxes while you say you are balancing the budget. I have no objection to a tax cut if the tax cut is not couched in terms of balancing the budget. Surely we have been through this before.Mr. Speaker, I have no objection to tax cuts as such. Quite the opposite. I would like to see tax incentives. I would like to see, for example, and I think it is well known, I believe that we should have a business meal entertainment deduction increase. I would like to see it at 100 percent. I have no objection to supply-side economics, as such, when we can justify it, deliberate it, and discuss it on an issue-by-issue basis. I think that I could make a case that the business meal entertainment deduction is a job provider, is a job generator; that we could find labor and management on the same side of the table on that. I think the spousal deduction for travel ought to be put forward as an incentive to boosting the economy.I think we will find, Mr. Speaker, in our home States that tourism, entertainment, and travel constitute one of the top three business endeavors in our States. Tourism, travel, and entertainment is the top money producer and job generator in some 13 States, and it is one of the top three in 30-plus States.I am willing, Mr. Speaker, not only willing but eager, to have a discussion about where we can have tax incentives and tax breaks, and discuss what constitutes, as I said with the gentleman from Michigan previously, what constitutes welfare. Welfare is not just something that comes with a single mother and children. Welfare can come to corporations, too.I notice that Mr. Trump was not hurting for people to come to his aid and rescue when he needed all the benefits of corporate welfare, when he was running through his various real estate machinations in New York and Atlantic City and elsewhere. Business has these incentives and breaks all the time.I think individuals ought to be able to finance their education. We cannot exist in the 21st century without a good education, and I think that would be a good investment, if we can find a way to provide tax incentives and breaks to accomplish that. I think we would benefit from that.The argument against that is the immediate consequences of some incentives and cuts and breaks, whatever we want to call them, may be a drop in the Treasury. I would argue that. We would have to determine whether or not, for example, with business meal entertainment deductions and the spousal travel deduction, if we were able to increase that, I think more business would be done, and I could make an argument that revenues would increase. This is essentially the supply-side argument that took place in the 1980's.However, if we take it in such a broad brush that it is to cover everything, then I think we run into the trouble that this budget runs into, that we cannot make the numbers add up. That is where I think the difficulty occurs here. I would like to think, and I certainly hope that I am a reasonable person who takes his oath as seriously as anyone does in all of the Congress, and I believe every one of my colleagues and yourself, Mr. Speaker, takes himself or herself quite seriously when it comes to carrying out their duty under their oath of office.As a result of that, I would like to think that while we may have disagreements as to the precise way in which we can accomplish our goals, that nonetheless, the discussion as to how to arrive at that is not only very valuable, but crucial to determining whether or not we are actually going to accomplish the goal. The goal here is ultimately to balance the budget while keeping the economy robust, and to see to it that the average American throughout the spectrum of opportunity and individual capacities and abilities does the very best that they can nationwide. That is what we do.Mr. Speaker, it used to be a point of pride in this country that people earned a good living, that they could end up better than where they started. Now we seem to see an ethos developing of cost-cutting, which means people-cutting. People are being rewarded at the top of the corporate hierarchy for being able to cut jobs out, and to see to it that people are maligned simply for trying to get an increase in the minimum wage.I do not think this is the atmosphere in which we want to discuss something like balancing the budget, because if the only way to balance the budget is to take it on the backs of children or on people trying to better themselves in life, that is no solution. To me, that runs counter to my understanding of what the American dream is all about.So in that context, then, it seems to me that what is very important here is that we discuss what is actually happening. What actually is happening is that the budget is gradually being balanced, as it should be, without endangering the economy. The deficit declines for the fourth consecutive year in 1996. This is the first time it has happened since the Truman administration. I am going over some of the elements that I have cited before in a little more detail.The traditional Congressional Budget Office baseline projections include discretionary spending at caps established in 1993 and show the deficit rising after 1996 and reaching $210 billion in 2002. This is $18 billion lower than the December projection of this year, and $80 billion lower than April of 1995. In other words, these numbers can change with the wind, but the wind has to be blowing in the right direction.The direction of the budgetary wind is this: That we have a prudent understanding of what it takes to have the budget balance. To simply do it arbitrarily, as is done in this 1997 budget, and to think about the idea of cutting taxes at the same time that you are trying to achieve a balance in the budget and a reduction of the deficit, more than a reduction, the balancing of deficit spending, I think is beyond credibility.I would indicate, Mr. Speaker, because I have had some considerable time to discuss it, and perhaps not all of our colleagues have heard the whole discussion, the hypothesis that I am putting forward, the thesis that I am putting forward, is that if you have as the budget, and the document I am referring to is the budget of the majority, the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives, if we have, as the Committee on the Budget indicates, deficits for every year from 1997 through 2001, and then suddenly find a surplus in the year 2002, it is just not credible. Try and sell that in Ravenswood, WV.I talked with friends there today. I said I was going to make a presentation today. They were interested in what I was going to say, what my premises were going to be. I just asked whether or not this sounded credible, that you could have deficits, declining as they might be right up to 2001, and suddenly come up with a surplus in 2002, and then from 2003 on just watch the deficit expand again.I hope that we are not going to be subject, Mr. Speaker, to Member after Member coming to the well of the House and regaling us with stories about their children and their grandchildren and all this mawkish, overblown rhetoric about how they are so concerned with their children and grandchildren, presumably none of the rest of us are, which I find a little bit farfetched, but rather, if we are so concerned about children and grandchildren, maybe we should be a little more honest with them right now.My fundamental point is this budget does not balance. The budget in 1998 does not balance. The budget in 1999 does not balance. The budget in 2000, 2001, it does not balance. How is it going to balance in 2002? Even if it does on paper, how long is it going to last? Merely the time it takes to say it: ``Oh, the budget is balanced''? Well, it was balanced, because it was balanced when I said it, but now we are 3 seconds beyond that time and it is not balanced anymore. But we balanced it for that moment, on paper, just to go through that allusion. I do not think it is worthy of this Congress to do it.So, Mr. Speaker, I think if we look at 1996 and what we went through, we did not have a balanced budget but we did manage to cut the deficit. We did manage to cut the rate of the deficit. We did hold inflation down. We held steady on interest rates. I think on the whole, then, the President's priorities were met. The majority ultimately voted for a budget that was more in line with the President's priorities, so the President is entitled to credit for sticking to a position with respect to the rate of the deficit reduction under the premises established by the majority in the Congress, the Republican majority, and it worked.Now the President is coming forward again, saying that he would like to see these priorities carried forward on education, on Medicare, on Medicaid and the environment, and that he has certain standards that he desires to maintain under pain of exercising his veto. That is his constitutional right. In fact, it is his obligation as President, even as President Bush and President Reagan before him exercised the veto dozens and dozens of times, most of which we were unable to overcome when we were the majority here in the House of Representatives or the majority in the Senate. They prevailed. That is our constitutional system.It is supposed to be hard to pass legislation in the United States of America. What many people call gridlock is the wheels of government turning precisely the way the Framers of the Constitution intended for them to turn. The Congress of the United States makes policy, yes, but only if it achieve the approbation of the executive. The executive can prevail against the legislative body only if the executive can be sustained in the legislative body. We have the judicial side to see to it that we both keep a proper balance. That is our system.Mr. Speaker, I do not find it regrettable in the least that it is difficult to pass items like the budget. What I find regrettable is that we seem to be passing it so easily this week, Mr. Speaker. That is what bothers me. This is the single most important document with respect to the legislative business and what follows from it that we will have before us this year. It certainly is the most important piece of legislation before the election which is to take place in November. As a result, it seems to me we should be devoting considerable time to it.I appreciate the fact that the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Smith] came down and was willing to spend some time discussing it. I think the import of the arguments that he made essentially supports my position. Of course, I can make that statement now because he has left the floor and cannot taken an opposing position to that, but I think I can extract from what he said at least a reasonable basis for saying, as I have, and indicate again to you at this moment, that we need to be much more gradual about it. To that degree, the President seems to be taking the right approach. He has accepted the will of the majority with respect to the premises upon which it bases its balanced budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office.It is not necessary for me to explain to you, Mr. Speaker, what the Congressional Budget Office is. Suffice it to say that every legislative body relies upon individuals, experts in their field, to make recommendations and to draw upon statistics and information made available to them from their various professional fields and backgrounds in order to complete a picture. In this instance, it is a picture of what the economy is like and what we can expect.This does not mean they are going to be absolutely correct in every instance, but all individual families, all companies, all businesses, all organizations, in fact, all nations, have to utilize the best brains that they have available, accumulate the most knowledge that they can, and try to draw reasonable conclusions as to what the future might bring so they can make decisions. That is all the Congressional Budget Office does with respect to the budget. It makes the best estimate that it can based upon the premises that are agreed upon.In this instance, Mr. Speaker, we have agreed upon premises which, by definition of the budget, do no add up to a balance. I have no objection to passing this budget, Mr. Speaker, with the admonition that we should take up the President's disagreement with respect to the priorities. I voted for the budget previously, and despite my own misgivings, so it is not a question of whether we should vote on a budget, it is question of what the priorities should be.I have no objection to saying that this could be a step in the direction of balancing the budget, if we have the President's priorities involved in it. I do object to us indicating to the American people that somehow this is going to lead to a balanced budget, just as I object to the idea of going through this illusion and farce, which apparently is going to take place in the other body, about passing a balanced budget amendment. The balanced budget amendment will no more achieve a balanced budget than this document does.This does not achieve a balanced budget, and neither does passing the balanced budget amendment accomplish anything of the kind, any more than vows in a marriage guarantee that there will be happiness and prosperity in it. You can have the intention, but unless you put behind it the activity which will ensure that happy consequence, then you cannot claim that it will happen.What I am saying here is if we put forward a budget that says, yes, we will cut spending and we will cut spending in a way that will continue to reduce the deficit over time and we hope at some point then to be able to reach balance, then that is all right. Not only is it all right, but that is the right way to do it.I mentioned a mortgage before. Let me draw the analogy for my colleagues here and for those who may be interested in the record.Just as you are not expected to have cash on hand to buy your house but, rather, you are expected to be able to make your payments, be able to meet your obligations over a period of time, then you can go forward with the purchase of that home and say that you own it. Do you actually own it? No. Because the bank owns it. We are going to have a mortgage-burning ceremony perhaps in 30 years.But that bank is making a bet. That bank is betting that you have the capability and the capacity to make those payments for that period of time. Think about it. Twelve times a month for 13 years. That is pretty good guessing. Perhaps it bespeaks a knowledge of finance and general economic trends that is fairly reliable.Now, that being the case, I think we need to do the same thing with this budget. Let us not con the American people into thinking for a moment that this document is moving toward balancing the budget in the year 2002. It is not true. It is not going to happen. That is irrefutable.On the contrary, he agreed with my premise. It is not going to be balanced because we do not take into account how we are going to pay for all of the money that we borrowed to presumably create the illusion of balancing this budget.What we can do is create over time an ability to pay, a robust economy that will enable us to gradually draw down the amount of the deficit with prudent spending, with a clear understanding of what programs we want to support and why we want to support them and how they benefit the American people, and over that lengthy period of time accomplish this goal. There is nothing not only wrong with that, that is the sensible, practical, reasonable way to do it, because it maximizes the opportunity for the great mass of American people to join in the prosperity, to be able to better themselves in what they want to accomplish for themselves and their family.So I stand here today, Mr. Speaker, I do not think a lonely voice or a single voice. I think I stand here enunciating fairly clearly for the American people, and I hope for my colleagues, most certainly, the idea that we should not utilize the budget process for political purposes merely because there is an election, but we should utilize our opportunity with this budget process to begin to make progress towards reducing the deficit, coming into balance, having the economy grow and seeing a robust, prosperous economy for all.Mr. Speaker, inasmuch as there is only a minute left, I want to thank you for your courtesy today in allowing me to speak and for sharing this time with me. I hope that I have made some contribution today. I intend to, in the future, towards reviewing the 1997 budget and reviewing the whole question of the budget deficit, the budget balance proposition, and seeing to it that all Americans now and in the future are able to enjoy a prosperous future.

As you know, Burma is ruled by a brutal military dictatorship which rejects the mandate of the democratic elections of 1990.Although Aung San Suu Kyi is no longer under house arrest, the military regime has been stepping up its repressive measures against her and her party, the National League for Democracy. As the sixth anniversary of the democratic election approached, over 200 people were arrested. Recently, the regime released half of the detainees. These arrests were the latest example of the egregious human rights situation in Burma.Aung San Suu Kyi and members of the National League for Democracy did not give in to the fear of retribution. They held rallies these past two weekends and will continue to meet.I say to Anug San Suu Kyi, thank you for your courage and devotion to principle, you inspire all of us. You are a very courageous woman, who has endured uncomprehensible hardships.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak out against granting China the most-favored-nation [MFN] status. For many years I have followed the human rights and business violations occurring in China. This past year we have once again seen many problems arise with China.As my colleagues know, last month the United States customs agents arrested suspects in the United States with ties to China's state-owned munitions companies for smuggling AK-47's and other dangerous weapons into the United States. These same companies are selling nuclear weapons technology to Pakistan and advanced missile technology to Iran.Many people claim that if we don't grant MFN status to China that American business will be hurt. That's not true. American businesses are hurt by the Chinese Government allowing piracy of copyrighted American goods. These pirated copies are made in factories with the full knowledge of the Chinese Government. Everyone here is aware that a trade war was barely averted yesterday because the United States and China came to an agreement that is designed to crack down on Chinese piracy of compact discs and computer software.Unfortunately, I don't think the Chinese understand that we are serious about protecting our copyrighted goods. Once again, the Chinese have only been slapped on the wrist for not abiding by agreements made. In the past, MFN status has been granted in hopes that the Chinese Government was going to crack down on the piracy problems and human rights violations. This has not happened yet.Granting MFN to China does not encourage the Chinese Government to correct their human rights violations. Despite China's robust economy and economic reforms, there continues to be widespread human rights abuses. China still places severe restrictions on freedom of speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, privacy, movement and worker rights. In Sunday's Post, it was noted that China's priority for the next 15 years would be to discredit Tibet's exiled religious leader, his Holiness, the Dalai Lama.I ask my colleagues to ask themselves--Why would we want to grant MFN status to a country that continues to ignores human rights violations, continues to replicate American copyrighted goods, smuggles guns into our country, and has given nuclear technology to rogue nations? I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against MFN for China.",

    "title": "LEGISLATION DISAPPROVING THE NRC FROM LOCATING A NUCLEAR WASTE FACILITY",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today with other concerned Members of Congress to introduce legislation which amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to prohibit the licensing of a permanent or interim nuclear waste storage facility outside the 50 States. Specifically, this bill would preclude the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from issuing a license for the storage of radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel in any of the U.S. territories. Senator Daniel Akaka has already introduced a companion bill, S. 1878, in the U.S. Senate.I have grown increasingly troubled by statements and presentations that have been made by a New York City investment firm, KVR, Inc., that earlier this year made an offer for Palmyra Island, an atoll of more than 40 islets 1,000 miles south of Hawaii. Initially, it was reported that KVR. Inc. talked about using Palmyra for scientific research and hotel development of some kind. However, recent events make it evident that KVR, Inc. wants to use Palmyra for a repository of radioactive waste.KVR, Inc. has been circulating draft legislation among the administration and Members of Congress to locate a radioactive waste site on a Pacific atoll. According to representative from KVR, Inc. Palmyra is on a short list of candidate sites being considered.I want to state for the record that I am unequivocally against this initiative.In order to locate the site at Palmyra the draft legislation waives compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act in regard to the preparation of the environmental impact statement and the Clean Water Act to dredging.Siting a radioactive waste facility is a serious matter. The environmental consequences cannot be ignored. For too long the Pacific community has been used as a nuclear dumping ground. The United States tested nuclear devices in the Marshall Islands, and we are all having to deal with the enormous costs associated with these tests. More recently, the Government of France conducted a series of nuclear tests at the Moruroa and Fangatauga atolls in the South Pacific, which was opposed by over 160 nations.Mr. Speaker, my bill is preemptive strike against proposals to designate a radioactive waste site in the Pacific. KVR, Inc. attempts to achieve a laudable goal but at an enormous cost. I want to advise my colleagues that any attempt to go forward with the KVR, Inc. proposal will be vigorously and vehemently opposed.",

    "title": "ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak out against granting most-favored-nation status to China. Many of my colleagues have discussed the various aspects of China's MFN status; I am going to concentrate on the issue of exporting forced labor manufactured products to the United States. The Chinese Government has not complied with the memorandum of understanding on prison labor between the United States and China also known as the MOU.In the MOU, the Chinese acknowledged that exporting forced labor products to the United States is illegal. Key provisions of the MOU state that China will promptly investigate companies or enterprises suspected of violating relevant regulations; they will furnish available evidence and information regarding suspected violations; and they will allow United States officials to visit the respective enterprises or companies.This violation should be important to any working American. Importing products made by convicted, forced or indentured labor in Chinese prison camps takes jobs away from Americans. The United States should not continue granting MFN status to China while it is exporting prison labor products. There are many examples of Chinese and United States companies deliberately violating the law.For example, the Customs Bulletin and Decisions published in the Federal Register on April 23, 1996, reports that certain iron pipe fittings are made using prison labor at the Tianjin Malleable Iron Factory also known as the Tianjin Tongbao Fittings Co., also known as the Tianjin No. 2 Malleable Iron Plant, also known as the Tianjin Secondary Mugging Factory, also known as the Tainajin No. 2 Prison. I'm sure you noticed that the prison goes by many names and is only one example of how the Chinese Government tries to mislead companies and countries on where exported manufactured products are being made.The March 1996 State Department report entitled ``China Human Rights Practices,'' states that cooperation with United States officials has stalled since mid-1995. ``As of the end of 1995, the authorities had not granted access to a prison labor facility since April 30th. * * * As in many Chinese workplaces, safety is a low priority. There are no available figures for casualties in prison industry.''Another example of exported prison labor can be found by examining the Chinese expandable graphite exports. The only mine in China which produces expandable graphite for export is a forced labor camp called the Beishu Laogai Detachment, also known as the Shandong Province Beishu Prison, the Shandong Province Beishu Shengjian Graphite Mine, the Beishu Graphite Mine, and recently the Qingdao Graphite Mine. Producing expandable graphite is dangerous because it involves the extensive use of sulfuric and chromic acid. Shipping records from 1992 to 1995 show that two major customers of the expandable graphite in the United States were the Asbury Graphite Company and China Enterprises.Let me refresh some of my colleagues' memories in the case they don't remember watching the June 1995 Tom Brokaw interview with Steven Riddle, CEO of the Asbury Graphite Co. in New Jersey. During the interview, Mr. Riddle admitted that his company was purchasing expandable graphite from Qingdao Mines, a forced labor camp. In addition, Mr. Riddle admitted that he sometimes worried that his company, Asbury Graphite was violating the law, but ``everybody tends to look the other way.'' We need to stop looking the other way. United States companies should not feel comfortable purchasing forced labor products from China. The U.S. Customs Agency needs to put its foot down and enforce the law.An interesting side note: The Beishu Laogai Detachment was unexpectedly visited on Christmas Day, 1994, by a reporter from the London Sunday Times, named Nick Rufford. He reported that ``Evidence of the use of forced labor was abundant. Inmates marched in double file. Trucks with `Beishu prison' stenciled on the sides in Chinese characters were parked inside the factory gates. Behind the plant stood a walled compound with watchtowers and guards.'' Mr. Rufford reported 3,500 tons of graphite from the mine was shipped to Britain last year.As many of my colleagues know, Amnesty International and other sources have provided ample documentation of the cruel and abusive practices common in Chinese prisons. That abuse, the restricted journals clearly show, is translated directly into hard currency earned in the export trade.For example, in a journal whose readership is restricted to prison officials, a writer laid out the brutal logic of using prison labor for export production: ``Prisoners have become commodity producers. they are cheap and concentrated. They produce labor intensive products.'' It is precisely the goods which fall into the labor intensive category that form the bulk of Chinese exports to the United States.The article also shows that it is common practice in China to forcibly retain so-called labor reform prisoners for indefinite periods beyond the expiration of their terms. the industrial advantages are explained clearly to prison administrators: ``Prisoners retained for in-camp employment * * * can not join labor unions, do not enjoy retirement benefits when they become old, and their wages and living standards are low.''These abuses seal the case against granting China MFN status. China does not play by the rules. China does not reciprocate the trade benefits we grant to them. Despite the fact that over one-third of China's exports are sold into the United States market, China's high tariffs and non tariff barriers limit access to the Chinese market for United States goods and services. Only 2 percent of United States exports are allowed into China. The result is a $34 billion United States trade deficit with China in 1995. This doesn't include any of the stolen intellectual property of the illegally smuggled guns. I strongly urge my colleagues that we no longer reward China's constant violations of agreements. Vote against granting MFN status to China.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gentleman from Colorado, inasmuch as he continues to invoke the name of Hawaii, to at least try to be accurate. I understand the gentleman has his political duty that he is going to do today here, at least as he conceives it. I do not object to that. I do object to his, I must say, making statements like ``Hawaii mandating its wishes on the rest of the Nation''; his constant invocation of what Hawaii intends to do or not do.I daresay that there are not five people in this House of Representatives that have the slightest clue as to what is taking place legislatively or judicially or personally in Hawaii with respect to this issue. I can tell the Members that the individuals involved are constituents of mine, two of whom I know personally.I know that the kind of rhetoric that has been utilized with respect to this issue does not reflect either their wishes or their motivations. I find it at best a question that needs to be answered as to our definition with respect to marriage. I will not use the word hypocritical, but I think others might certainly question the motivation of people who want to define marriage when this Defense of Marriage Act might better be characterized as defense of marriages.If we intend to say that marriage, and we are writing a national marriage law, which is what we want to do here, is between one man and one women, does that mean that we will now write a national divorce law? Because I understand some of the people who are sponsoring this bill are on their second or third marriages. I wonder which one they are defending.I do not object to that. I think people are entitled to make their private relationships what they will and to seek such happiness in this life as they are able to achieve, but I think that when we move into the area of the private relationships of other people, that we at least ought to show some respect for the human context.When the gentleman from Colorado and others speak so glibly of Hawaii and the people who are involved in the legal proceedings there, they forget these are human beings, some human beings that I know personally. All they are trying to do is conduct their lives as reasonable, sober, responsible people seeking their measure of happiness and tranquility in this life, and to try to bring as much as they can into their lives of the values that we cherish in Hawaii, of kindness and responsibility.Mr. Speaker, amendments will be offered to this bill, because this is more than the defense of marriage. It also gets into the question of benefits. We contend and I certainly contend that nothing that is proceeding today in Hawaii and in the courts of Hawaii affects in any way what any other State does. It is quite clear, and I can cite at great length, and I do not have the time obviously now, the fact that other States are able to establish already what they recognize or do not recognize with respect to marriage.The full faith and credit clause has been invoked in our Nation's history very few times, less than half a dozen times, and it involves the custody of children, the protection of children, the interstate capacity to enforce child support laws. That is the kind of thing we have dealt with, serious issues.I do not doubt that it is a serious issue for individuals here as to what constitutes marriage, but to try to utilize Hawaii for some political agenda having to do with, I guess, the elections in November is something that I find nothing less than reprehensible. We can define marriage any way we want in the States right now. This bill has nothing to do with that. Hawaii certainly is not challenging it.In fact, I would like to hear from the gentleman from Colorado or anybody else any indication that the State of Hawaii has ever indicated in any way, shape, or form that it intends to, as the gentleman put it, mandate its wishes on the rest of the Nation. I do not think this is the case, and I do not think this is the bill to do this kind of thing, and certainly not to malign Hawaii in the process.",

    "title": "DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak against H.R. 3396, the Defense of Marriage Act. The title of the bill is puzzling. What are we defending marriage against: divorce, domestic violence, adultery? Can anyone name a single married couple whose union would be strengthened or defended against harm by this legislation? With all the unresolved burning issues facing this institution, it is nothing short of incredible that we would be diverting time and energy away from questions like Medicare, the environment, and the economy on this matter.Supporters of the bill point to what they claim is the danger of same-gender marriage. They say that if a court in Hawaii rules in favor of same-gender couples, other States will then have to give ``full faith and credit'' to the resulting marriages. I'm going to take this opportunity to concentrate on the traditions of our Nation, in particularly the rights of States and the Constitution of the United States. H.R. 3396 is an unnecessary intrusion into the State domain of family law. It tears at the fabric of our Constitution.Historically, States have the primary authority to regulate marriage based upon the 10th amendment of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has supported this constitutional right. In Aukenbrandt versus Richards, 1992, the Court rules that ``without exception, domestic relations has been a matter of state, not federal concern and control since the founding of the Republic.''It is also interesting to note that questions concerning the validity of an out-of-state marriage are generally resolved without reference to the ``full faith and credit'' clause of the U.S. Constitution. States traditionally recognize out-of-state marriages unless they have statutes prohibiting such a union. For example, polygamy is illegal in all States, and in most states certain incestuous marriages are illegal too. States can declare an out-of-state marriage void if it is against the state's public policy or if entered into with the intent to evade the law of the State.Congress has invoked the ``full faith and credit'' clause only five times since the founding of the Republic. The three most recent instances have required each State to give child custody, child support, and protection orders of other States the same faith and credit it gives its own such orders. The Defense of Marriage Act differs in one critical aspect from the legislative enactment passed by the Congress under it full faith and credit power: H.R. 3396 permits sister States to give no effect to the laws of other States.This is a novel and unconstitutional interpretation of the clause. According to a leading constitutional law scholar, Laurence H. Tribe, ``the Constitution delegates to the United States no power to create categorical exceptions to the Full Faith and Credit Clause.''The Supreme Court just recently struck down a Colorado law that targeted gay and lesbians in Romer versus Colorado, This case suggests that the Supreme Court will rule legislation motivated by animus against gays and lesbians unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment unless the legislative classification bears a rational relationship to a legitimate State purpose. In other words, since H.R. 3396 targets a group of people due to their--in the words of Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council--``dangerous lifestyle and behavior,'' it is likely to be struck down by the courts. There is no dire urgency or compelling public interest to pass this measure, which is not only unnecessary but also likely to be found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.In addition, I find it hard to believe how many of my colleagues can justify their support of H.R. 3396 when they are also cosponsors of H.R. 2270. At least 37 Members of the House are cosponsors of both bills. H.R. 2270 would require the Congress to specify the source of authority under the U.S. Constitution for the enactment of laws. Where in article I or anywhere else in the Constitution is the Congress given authority to write a national marriage law? Maybe the sponsors of both bills don't see the contradiction. Maybe they just don't care.Many on the other side of the aisle have been vocal and unceasing in their support for reversing the flow of power away from Washington and back to the States. Well, the laws governing marriage are traditionally and constitutionally under the authority of the States. If there is any area of law to which States can lay a claim to exclusive authority, it is the field of family relations. How can someone reconcile being for States rights while at the same time taking away a basic, constitutional right given to States by the Framers of our Constitution? I strongly encourage my colleagues to allow the States to continue exercising their constitutional rights and not fan the flames of intolerance. As William Eskeridge, Law Professor at Georgetown University, simply stated, ``the reasons to hesitate before adopting this legislation are conservative ones: federalism, original intent and tradition.''Let us remember that the United States draws its strength from the enormous diversity to be found within the borders of our great Nation. Vote against The Defense of Marriage Act.The CHAIRMAN. All time has expired for general debate.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.Mr. Chairman, as long as Hawaii has this incredible power to be able to mandate whatever it decides on the rest of the Nation, I wan thinking that perhaps we could mandate the Hawaii health care system for the other 49 States, so that we would not have to worry about national health care, and we would mandate the weather, if we could, but I think that is even beyond our powers.There is a serious note to be engaged in here, because the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Frank] has to do with the definition. If Members are in fact intending to define marriage nationally in the terms that have been related in the debate so far, they have indicated it is an institution in which we have a secular, sacred duty to maintain the union between a man and a woman.If that is the case, and Members really intend to do this, and we are sincere about covering this as a national definition of marriage, then why do Members not have a national divorce clause in here as well, forbidding it? Where are the criminal penalties associated with adultery? I have heard a continuous drumbeat from some Members here about this union of a man and a woman. If that is the case, I presume, then, Members are going to forbid divorce and most certainly impose penalties with adultery. But I do not see it in here.There appear to be circumstances in which this union of a man and woman can take place in the context of marriage again and again and again. I am not quite sure how the transition is made in Members' definitions, but that is what takes place, all of this within the context that this deficition has to be made in a national context, because of what may or may not happen in Hawaii. But what is left out of this is that the Federal law over and over again, as stated as recently as 1992, and I am quoting the Supreme Court, ``Without exceptions, domestic relations have been a matter of State, not Federal, concern and control since the founding of the Republic.''In this particular instance, it is the State constitution in Hawaii that is the grounds for the suit in Hawaii. The State constitution in Hawaii has particular references to the right of privacy and equal protection that are not found in other constitutions in other States. Therefore, it does not apply.Members should vote for the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Frank] because even if there is a ruling in Hawaii, it does not therefore follow that Pennsylvania or Florida or Illinois or any of the other States have to follow it at all, unless there are similar provisions, and there are judges that would make decisions based on similar interpretations of similar provisions in Members' own State constitutions.The attorneys for the coules that came into court in Hawaii have stated again and again that it is the particular provisions of the Hawaii State Constitution that they are refering to, so it is disingenuous at best for those who want to maintain that this amendment is something that should be voted for to indicate that unless we have this bill today, and unless we defeat the amendment of the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Frank], Members are going to be forced to accept what was a result of a court decision in Hawaii, if it happens to go that way.The State is disputing this at the present time, and may prevail. So unless someone who is in favor of the bill can tell me how the U.S. Constitution reflects the specific provisions in the Hawaii State Constitution, which extend beyond the Federal Constitution the right of privacy and the equal protection based on gender, unless they can explain that, I do not see how Members can deny the validity of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts.I would yield to anybody who can explain to me how the U.S. Constitution, which only deals by implication with the Hawaii State Constitution, will somebody please tell me how the U.S. Constitution and the Hawaii State Constitution are comparable in these two respects, which is the basis for the suit in Hawaii?There are constitutional experts. Do not look puzzled. Members know perfectly well what I am talking about. There is a right to privacy in Hawaii, there is no discrimination based on gender in the Hawaii State Constitution, which does not appear in the U.S. Constitution except by implication, if Members make the argument. In other words, I get no response.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the manager's amendment to H.R. 1975, the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Fairness and Simplification Act. May I say in that regard that I want to thank my colleague and friend, the gentleman from California, Chairman Ken Calvert, and the staff on his side for their fairness in helping to make this as simple a process as possible.As he has indicated in his remarks, this is an issue with which not everyone may be familiar but which is fundamental to the sound fiscal policy with respect to Federal oil and gas royalty fees.I also note the presence on the floor of the chairman of our Committee on Resources, Mr. Young, and I am very pleased to see him here and I appreciate his kindness and fairness. I can no doubt add a few other adjectives, depending on how much I sense from him that he appreciates the same in me. I can see from his body language that he understand the full import of my remarks.Mr. Speaker, the manager's amendment will substitute the language written by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for the language reported by the House Committee on Resources. The primary difference between the House and Senate language is that the Senate language authorizes but does not mandate the Secretary of the Interior to delegate certain royalty management functions to willing and qualified States.This issue has been gone over in detail by the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert], so I will not repeat it.This would resolve my major problem with the bill and removes the President's veto threat on the bill. I would note that during committee consideration of H.R. 1975 I offered an amendment which the majority did not accept at that time that would have made this very change. I am pleased to see that they now concur with me and that there is no reason to require the Secretary of the Interior to transfer the royalty functions to the States.But while there are many positive features in the manager's amendment, it still contains, in my estimation, some flaws. For example, I continue to believe that is no reason to require the Federal Government to pay interest on oil companies' overpayments to the Federal Treasury, especially when these mistakes occur as a result of sloppy accounting or possible sloppy accounting by oil and gas companies. This new benefit for oil and gas corporations will create, again in my estimation, a new Federal debt and possibly cost taxpayers an estimated $44 million between 1997 and 2002 and possibly an additional $10 million in direct spending each year thereafter.However, in the interest of comity, I am willing to take the majority at its word, particularly that of the gentleman from California, Chairman Calvert, and the gentleman from Alaska, Chairman Young, and accept the administration's assurance that this provision will not be allowed to be abused by the oil and gas lessees. Knowing the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young] as I do, I doubt that anybody can get away with anything.Improvement is always in order, and the majority has worked diligently with the Clinton administration to effect this compromise and, I would like to reiterate, has worked diligently with the minority on the committee as well. If we are to govern, then we must be willing to accept compromises. I do so with this bill, and in this context and in this spirit of comity, we do not object to the passage of H.R. 1975, as amended by the bill's manager, and recommend its acceptance.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 1975, the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act. H.R. 1975 would streamline our Federal royalty collection system by improving the management of royalties from Federal and outer continental shelf oil and gas leases.Currently, about $4.2 billion is collected annually by the Federal Government in mineral receipts--our Nation's third largest revenue source. However, reform of our Nation's royalty collection system has been needed for some time. H.R. 1975 achieves the goals set out by the administration, the States, and industry to provide simplicity and fairness in the partnership between the Federal Government and the leaseholders of Federal lands.Specifically, this legislation would establish a clear statute of limitations on royalty collection, expand existing delegation to States provisions, and set time limits on administrative appeal decisions. This legislation also provides marginal well relief by reforming royalty collections for low-production wells--an issue of great importance to my home State of Texas.At a time when we continue to see increasing reliance on oil imports, this legislation provides the necessary relief to enhance domestic production in both an economically efficient and environmentally sound way. In addition, H.R. 1975 would help Congress in its efforts to balance the budget by providing an additional $51 million in royalties over the next 7 years.H.R. 1975 is supported by the administration, a bipartisan delegation of Members from Congress as well as 14 of our Nation's Governors who represent most of our Federal onshore production. It is also supported by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission and industry trade associations representing our Nation's Federal lessees. I urge my colleagues to support royalty simplification and fairness by voting in favor of H.R. 1975.",

Let me assure you that the Administration remains committed to ensuring the efficient management of Federal lands and finding new ways for the States to work cooperatively and creatively with the Federal Government. The President shares your hope that an agreement can be reached on the State delegation issue. In an effort to resolve this issue, Administration representatives, working with the staff of the Senate Energy Committee, were successful in reaching an agreement on language that would expand the list of delegable royalty management authorities, without reducing the Secretary of the Interior's responsibility with respect to the management of Federal lands. That language was included in S. 1014, which was reported out of the Senate Energy Committee on May 1st. The Administration supports S. 1014 as reported out of committee, but will seek a minor technical amendment. The Administration believes this bill's State delegation language is acceptable, unlike the language included in H.R. 1975, the House Resources Committee bill on Royalty Simplification. The Administration will continue to work with Congress as the legislative process moves forward, and stands ready to work in support of the language included in the Senate Energy Committee bill. I appreciate your interest and support in this important legislation. Sincerely, Leon E. Panetta, Chief of Staff.Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",

We have had the extensive cooperation and support again of the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert], our able chair, and of the chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young], for which I am very appreciative.H.R. 3249 would extend authorization for the Mining Institute to promote environmentally responsible mining technology development for the recovery of the minerals from our Nation's seabed. This type of technology, Mr. Speaker, is critical to the future of mining in the United States, and I am very pleased that this is recognized, again on a bipartisan basis, and am very thankful for the individual encouragement from the chairman of the full committee and the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert].Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in strong support of H.R. 3249, the Mining and Mineral Resources Institutes Act. This is legislation that was drafted and introduced in the true spirit of bipartisanship by the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Wicker] and myself.H.R. 3249 would extend authorization for a mining institute to promote environmentally responsible technology development for the recovery of minerals from the Nation's seabed. This type of technology is critical to the future of mining in the United States.H.R. 3249 is not a new Government program. Previously, the marine mining program was carried out under the Mineral Institutes Program within the Bureau of Mines. Last year the decision was made to terminate the Bureau of Mines. Yet, worthwhile functions of this agency still deserve and need support. One such example is in the Marine Mineral Technology Center of the Mineral Institutes Program. The executive branch, recognizing the value of this program, transferred this program to the Minerals Management Service.The Marine Mining Technology Center program is a unique cooperative program involving leading universities with expertise in applied problems in marine resources and the marine environment. The program is singular because for a relatively small sum of Federal seed money to State institutions and small research organizations, we have seen a prodigious amount of practical research and development accomplished. Additionally, as a byproduct, a number of high-quality graduate students have gained practical hands-on experience. The center's program of research, technology development, and education is multidisciplinary and international in scope.Currently, the marine mining program is carried out by the Continental Shelf Division, located at the University of Mississippi, and the Oceans Basins Division at the University of Hawaii. The University of Hawaii program has been assisted by matching funds from the State of Hawaii because of its critical input to State cooperative development programs, as well as university research and education. Practical aspects of the program have included major inputs to an environmental impact statement on cobalt crusts in the exclusive economic zone [EEZ] of the Hawaiian and Johnston Islands, State programs on sand for the preservation of Hawaii's beaches and coastal environment, and the cleanup of military ordinance from the offshore areas of Kaho'olawe Island, recently returned to the native Hawaiian people by the Navy.This program merits continued Federal support. I am hopeful that we will see this legislation proceed expeditiously through the Senate so that President Clinton can sign it into law this year.In that light, Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 3198, a bill that would reauthorize the 1992 Geologic Mapping Act through fiscal year 2000, and amend the act to designate that 20 percent of the total amount appropriated be allocated to the State component of the program. I would note that both the Clinton administration and the State Geologists support this bill.Congress enacted the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992--Public Law 102-285 and 43 U.S.C. sections 31a-h--in order to expedite the production of a geologic map data base for the Nation, which can be applied to land-use management, assessment, and utilization, conservation of natural resources, groundwater management, and environmental protection. The act designated the U.S. Geological Survey as the Federal agency responsible for planning, coordinating, and managing the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program. This program is carried out by a consortium of geologic mapping partners including State geological Surveys, universities, other Federal agencies, and the USGS.Geologic maps are the primary data base for nearly all applied and basic earth science investigations. Federal agencies, State and local governments, private industry, and the general public depend on the information provided by geologic maps. The current geologic map data base is inadequate to meet these needs and development of a comprehensive nationwide program of geologic mapping is required at a pace that responds to increasing demand for mapping in high-priority areas. The States and the USGS each conduct a yearly, needs-based survey to determine program priorities.Improved geologic map information has been shown, using benefit-cost analyses, to be of significant value in many decisionmaking processes, including:Exploring for and developing mineral, energy, and water resources;Screening and characterizing sites for toxic and nuclear waste disposal;Land use evaluation and planning for environmental protection;Earthquake hazards reduction;Predicting volcanic hazards;Designing and constructing infrastructure requirements such as utility lifelines, transportation corridors, and surface-water impoundments;Reducing losses from landslides and other ground failures;Mitigating effects of coastal and stream erosion; andSiting of critical facilities.I urge my colleagues to support enactment of this bill.Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",

South Korean visitors to the United States spent nearly $2 billion in 1995. This means economic growth and jobs for Americans particularly those in States most visited by South Koreans: California, New York, Hawaii, Guam, Nevada, Arizona, Illinois, and Washington, DC. All indications show that this boom is just the beginning. Today, South Korea has the 11th largest economy in the world and is the 6th largest United States trading partner. We need to take positive advantage of this new phase of South Korean prosperity.Unfortunately, the United States continues to restrict Korean travelers by not allowing South Korea to participate in the Visa Waiver Pilot Program [VWPP]. Although many more Koreans would like to visit the United States, they find the visa process to cumbersome. Today, the United States lags behind Canada, Australia, and other countries in cornering the Korean tourist market.The bill I offer with Mr. Jay Kim would establish a visa waiver pilot program for nationals of Korea who are traveling in tour groups to the United States. Under this bill, Korean visitors are allowed for a period of not more than 15 days. The bill would also establish special bond and notification requirements for tour operators. These include the posting of a $200,000 bond and approval by the Secretary for a tour operator's application to escort tour groups to the United States.As we work to strengthen our economy in this country, I am confident that increased revenues generated from Korean visitors will be most welcomed.",

In the brief time that I was here in 1986, I had the opportunity to participate in activities of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, and had the opportunity when I was elected in 1990 to again join that committee.I say ``opportunity,'' because it was there that I, I am sure, had an experience that has been shared with many, many other Members of the House of Representatives, the chance to listen to and to observe and to absorb the perspective and analysis of ocean policy that was the forte of the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Studds]. There are few people in this body, perhaps in the history of this body, better able to articulate their thoughts, particularly with respect to ocean policy, environmental policy.I think Mr. Studds is universally respected for his intellect and for the depth of his perspective on these issues. As the gentleman from California [Mr. Farr] and the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] have indicated, I doubt whether there is anyone in this body, including the renowned gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Frank], who has a quicker wit, a brighter intelligence, a sense of himself entirely self-contained, as opposed to perhaps some others in this body, someone who understands his role and has illuminated many, many corners which would otherwise remain abstract and obscure to the rest of us.It is always a lesson in oratory, I think, as well as perspective, to be able to listen to Mr. Studds outline for those of us who may not be entirely familiar with the legislation at hand, particularly in regard to the ocean, ocean policy, and fisheries, to be able to listen to him enumerate and elucidate for us on those areas, and come to not only a good understanding but solid commitment. I think that is why, as has been indicated, bipartisan support for so much in the way of ocean policy has been forthcoming, is because Gerry Studds has been able to articulate for all Members of the body not entirely familiar with the legislation exactly what it was about, exactly what the implications were, exactly what was in the national interest, and therefore was able to gain the approbation and good will of virtually every Member of the body for legislation that would otherwise be very difficult to comprehend.I really wish him the very best in whatever it is that he will be doing, but I can say with assurance, Mr. Speaker, that this body will be the poorer for him taking leave of it.Mr. Speaker, I rise today, then, to voice my support for H.R. 3487, the aforementioned National Marine Sanctuaries Preservation Act. I, too, wish to thank the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] and others on the committee, both Republican and Democrat, who have worked so hard in this reauthorization. This bipartisan piece of legislation was introduced by the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] and the gentleman from California [Mr. Farr]. I think the description they gave of the process by which it has arrived here today is an exact one. It was a pleasure to work with both of them. Hawaii is one of the 14 major areas where National Marine Sanctuaries, of which the prime objective is to protect our marine resources, have been designated and are in various stage of implementation. In fact, the final environmental impact statement/management plan on the designation of the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale Sanctuary is set to be released later this month.In particular, H.R. 3487, thanks to the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] and the gentleman from California [Mr. Farr], contains two provisions specific to the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary Act regarding the designation of the waters around the Island of Kaho'olawe for inclusion in the sanctuary and the prohibition of the establishment of user fees in the sanctuary.May I add parenthetically, Mr. Speaker, that this is a good example of the hard work and detailed work that had to go into this bill. I am sure the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] and the gentleman from California [Mr. Farr] would agree that virtually every one of the sanctuaries has unique capabilities and unique qualities that require particular individual attention, and the National Marine Sanctuaries Preservation Act is a prime example of how you have to suit legislation to the particular, and that you cannot put together a bill where one size will literally fit all. It cannot happen in this particular kind of legislation. The only way it can succeed is if you have Members who are willing to do their homework and be able to understand the particular necessities associated with each of the sanctuaries.Mr. Speaker, these provisions, the ones I mentioned with regard to Kaho'olawe, were brought to the attention of the Hawaii delegation by State officials as a result of meetings with the Sanctuary Advisory Council. This council was established to empower local communities to provide advice and recommendations to the sanctuary manager on the development and continued management of the site.Currently, the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale Sanctuary Act requires the Secretary of Commerce to make an annual finding concerning the suitability for the inclusion of the sanctuary of waters within 3 nautical miles of Kaho'olawe Island. However, the language included in H.R. 3487 provides that the Kaho'olawe Island Reserve Commission may request the Secretary of Commerce to include the waters surrounding Kaho'olawe into the sanctuary.If a determination of inclusion is made, the Secretary will provide notice to the Governor of Hawaii and prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement and management plan and any necessary implementing regulations in accordance with the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, the Sanctuary, and the National Environmental Policy Act.The Kaho'olawe provision puts the management of Kaho'olawe and the waters surrounding the island into the hands of the Kaho'olawe Island Reserve Commission. Furthermore, it protects the rights of the State of Hawaii and the Secretary to terminate inclusion of Kaho'olawe Island waters if the supplemental management plan, any implementing regulation or any term of the plan or regulation is unacceptable.In 1992, the initial boundaries of the Hawaiian Islands Sanctuary Act were designated. However, the waters around the island of Kaho'olawe, which were previously used by the Department of Defense as a weapons range, was purposely excluded.In 1993, the Governor of Hawaii signed an act which established and created the aforementioned Kaho'olawe Island Reserve Commission to oversee the departments and agencies of the State with respect to the management of the island reserve. It was further stipulated that the reserve shall be used solely and exclusively and reserved in perpetuity for the preservation and practice of all rights customarily and traditionally exercised by native Hawaiians for cultural, spiritual, and subsistence purposes; for the preservation and protection of the reserve's archaeological, historical, and environmental resources, rehabilitation, revegetation, habitat restoration, and preservation; and for education.In 1994, a memorandum of understanding between the U.S. Department of the Navy and the State of Hawaii conveyed the island of Kaho'olawe back to the State.The Department of the Navy in conjunction with the Kaho'olawe Island Reserve Commission has issued an informational draft request for proposals for the clean-up of Kaho'olawe. Issuance of the final RFP will occur after completion of the use plan for the island and several Navy-State agreements required by the Kaho'olawe memorandum of understanding.The second provision regards the prohibition of user fees in the sanctuary. This language was included as a result of concerns expressed by the State regarding the potential impacts of the sanctuary on local communities; this in the context that I previously outlined with respect to native Hawaiian customs, et cetera. Specifically, the language states that the Secretary of Commerce shall not institute any user fee under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act for any activity within the Hawaii Islands National Marine Sanctuary or any use of the Sanctuary or its resources, again in the context previously enumerated.Mr. Speaker, these two provisions will provide for the better management of the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale Marine Sanctuary. I most urgently ask all my colleagues to support H.R. 3487.Mr. Speaker, may I again thank the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] and the gentleman from California [Mr. Farr] for their hard work on this bill.",

    "title": "CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1996",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 919, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act amendments. These amendments are especially important for States like Hawaii that will benefit from an increase in the small State minimum for the distribution of funds under the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act.Under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, services and shelter for victims of domestic violence are provided by the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act to States on a population basis. Small population States receive a minute allocation under this act of $200,000, or 1 percent, whichever is less. S. 919 would increase the minimum allocation to $400,000 so small States can receive a fair share of the new funding available under the Violence Against Women Act.In the State of Hawaii, the percentage of homicides that were committed by family members is now seen as twice the national average, and it is my hope that increased funding and focus for Hawaii's domestic violence shelters and services can turn this frightening statistic around.Mr. Speaker, I wanted to go over a bit of the chronology of events as to how this report now reaches us on the floor because I think it is instructive not only for the membership, but for the community at large, as to how a matter that is seen as having tremendous public impact and community impact is able to be dealt with by the Congress. I think it is a lesson, a civics lesson, if my colleagues will, Mr. Speaker, in how to deal with drastic circumstances that are not otherwise amenable to being resolved in the community minus the legislative support of the Congress.In the course of that I want to compliment the office of the gentleman from Delaware [Mr. Castle], the staff in his office, and I most especially want to thank the ranking member, the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Kildee], and his staff, and I want to recognize and commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goodling], and his staff, for recognizing in turn how important this amendment was in seeing it through the entire conference. It is the kind of thing that can easily be lost unless there is an alert staff as well as an alert Chair and ranking member who have the good of the community at heart, and most particularly, those most vulnerable, the innocent among us, our children.I had received a letter, Mr. Speaker, from Governor Benjamin Cayetano, the Governor of our State of Hawaii, asking for support of the amendment and indicating that he was aware of how important the change from $200,000 to $400,000 would be. I got that in July. I am citing the specific times, Mr. Speaker, because I want to show how it is possible for the Congress to act with a concerted effort and respond rapidly, and this is an excellent example of it.I drafted a letter, a ``Dear Colleague'' letter, to Members, and I am very pleased that the gentlewoman from Hawaii, Mrs. Mink, my colleague, and the gentleman from Delaware, Mr. Castle, were the original signers of the letter, and we consulted with the staff of Mr. Goodling's committee, and we sent a ``Dear Colleague'' letter out to Members whose districts and whose States were affected. We invited them to sign a letter to Chairman Goodling of the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities in support of increasing the minimum, and I would like to quote, if I might, Mr. Speaker, briefly from the letter to Mr. Goodling because I think it provides, again, an example and a basis for understanding how legislation can be brought promptly to the floor in a way that effectively serves the ends sought.In addressing the chairman we wrote requesting his support for increasing the small State minimum in the distribution of funds. Small States were guaranteed a minimum, as I indicated, of $200,000. Congress recently increased the appropriation from $32 million in fiscal year 1995 to $47 million in 1996. Unfortunately, the small State minimum did not receive a comparable increase; thus States which we represented, those of us who signed the letter to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goodling], Alaska, Delaware, Washington, DC, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia and Wyoming did not benefit from the funding increase. Small States, of course, have the same pressing needs as large States to provide adequate services for women who have been the victims of domestic violence. Consequently we believed that it was imperative that the small State minimum be increased. The Senate had already increased the small State minimum to $400,000 in the Child Abuse and Prevention Treatment Act and was expected to include it.Mr. Speaker, the Senate, as I said, expected to include this provision in the Labor, HHS and Education appropriations bill but obviously required support of the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goodling] and the conferees in the conference. The result, Mr. Speaker, is before us today. It has been accomplished. In other words, between July and September of this year on a bipartisan basis, we were able to deal with this crisis. Small States were recognized, and more importantly, the children and those others who come under the aegis of this act were recognized as being in need. So I would like to close with a profound sense of gratitude to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goodling] and the committee and indicate that I hope that this will, if it has to be voted on, will be a unanimous vote of the Congress and offer in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, again a reference to the fact that it is possible for men and women of good will and acting in faith with the Constitution and our duties here in the House to act promptly on behalf of the children of this country.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, before I begin I want to say that I had the opportunity, in fact the privilege, of being in the Committee on Ways and Means the other day when the portrait of Mr. Young was unveiled. I want to take this opportunity to publicly thank him for his untiring efforts on behalf of the causes associated with the Committee on Resources. Regardless, Mr. Speaker, of what one's views might or might not be on any given issue, one can always count on the fact that in dealing with Chairman Young we are dealing with a man of unquestioned integrity, whose commitment to this Nation and to the Committee on Resources has been unfailing. I want to say to him, Mr. Young, that one of the singular privileges of my political life has been to serve with you.Mr. Speaker, I rise, with certain regrets, in support of H.R. 4168, a bill to close the Federal Helium Program. In these days of downsizing, it seems the time has come to terminate programs which appear to have outlived their usefulness, like the Federal Helium Program.Since 1925, when the Defense Department believed that dirigibles, or blimps, would be an integral part of our national defense, the Federal Government has managed a helium program. Today, the Federal Helium Program continues to serve the needs of major Federal users of helium, such as NASA and DOE laboratories.The Federal Government got involved in helium production at a time when there was no private helium production. Today, however, the private sector manufactures 90 percent of the world's helium production. For this reason, groups such as the National Taxpayers Union, the 20/20 TV program, the Interior Department inspector general, and the Heritage Foundation have called for its elimination.H.R. 4168, like its predecessor H.R. 3008 in this Congress and H.R. 3967 in the 103d Congress, enjoys bipartisan support. While I did not support termination of the program, I recognize that, after several years of consideration, Congress is poised to resolve the question of the helium program by terminating it. But, I remain concerned that we have not done enough to aid the 200-plus employees in Amarillo, TX, who will lose their livelihood as a consequence of our decision.During committee consideration of this bill, I offered an amendment to provide employee benefits in addition to those authorized under existing law, so that the 200-plus employees in Amarillo--many of whom have built their careers on this program--would get the same kind of additional education and job placement assistance that we gave defense employees working at bases that were closed. These are people--men and women--who through no fault of their own find themselves working for a Federal program targeted for downsizing. My amendment would have given these people help in addition to what the Secretary is already authorized to provide. The same kind of help that we have provided to many of the defense employees working at military bases scheduled for closure--job placement assistance, extended life and health insurance coverage and the option to take an early retirement without penalty.Sadly, my Republican colleagues could not be persuaded to provide this type of much-needed aid. During committee debate, my colleague, Representative Calvert argued that the Secretary already has the authority to provide these benefits. This is simply incorrect. My amendment would have added authority necessary to enable the Secretary to extend health and life insurance coverage for 3 years beyond an employee's termination; the Secretary does not have the ability to provide this assistance under current law. My amendment would have allowed Federal helium employees access to the enhanced early retirement option; current law does not provide for this protection. My amendment would have given Federal helium employees hiring preference governmentwide--not just in the Amarillo area as is provided for under existing law.So, my amendment failed. And even though I agreed with my colleague, Representative Mac Thornberry, that we don't need to terminate this program, I could see that the bill would pass. So I tried to lessen the blow so that the helium workers might be able to find another Federal job, or if they had served 20 years, take an early out and retire from civil service. But, this was not to be.These activities would have been paid from the existing helium account, and would have cost relatively pennies especially in comparison to the costs of unemployment payments. The CBO said that my amendment would have no budgetary effect.It seemed only fair to offer this assistance to the innocent victims of our downsizing zeal. So that the employees--who had nothing to do with the difficulties facing the program--would not be left stranded by their Government. But, my Republican colleagues could not see their war clear to help their fellow public servants. And so, today, we will pass H.R. 4168 under suspension of the rules so we can praise ourselves for making Government smaller. I just wish we could have done so in a more humane and compassionate manner. I am somewhat consoled by the information that provision for unemployment benefits has been included in the Interior appropriations conference report.",

So I trust that all Members will recognize and abide by the request of the chairman.I have little to add, Mr. Speaker, but rather to supplement just briefly. As indicated, we are asking the House to sign compromise language reauthorizing the National Marine Sanctuaries bill back from the other body in the hope that it will send the bill to the President before adjournment.This bill contains all that the bill we passed previously does. It embodies the House-Senate compromise, as had been indicated, that has bipartisan support. And I want to state that for the record. It most certainly is acceptable to the administration.I want to emphasize that it provides a generous 3-year reauthorization for the program and contains many of the miscellaneous provisions, some of which the chairman pointed out, principally, to enhance the management of individual marine sanctuaries and to give NOAA the authority to raise private funds for sanctuary activities. I think the latter is particularly important.All around, this is the kind of legislation that has been the rule rather than the exception from our Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans for much the same reasons as outlined by the chairman. I commend him for his hard work and the cooperation of him and the staff and the cooperation of many other individuals on the subcommittee and Committee of the Whole for this bill and the many others that we have had come before us.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield, carrying Mrs. Mink's point a bit further, is it not interesting, is it not instructive that the French think that they can move ahead with this testing and at the same time condemn the activities or the presumed activities with respect to testing or the utilization of atomic or hydrogen weapons by Iran or Iraq or Pakistan or the People's Republic of China.Is it not clear that by France, ostensibly one of our allies, despite the fact that it has never cooperated with us in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as a member of the Committee on National Security, I can say that one of our great difficulties with respect to European security is never being able to know where France will be. Will they be behind us? Will they be beside us? If they are behind us, what do they have in mind for us? What do they have in mind for Europe?We find ourselves in the position of attempting to establish a standard with respect to testing, asking other countries to follow our lead in ending the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons as an act of common humanity on behalf of all the nations on the planet.And when France moves ahead with this kind of testing, how do we have the moral authority then to be able to say to Iran, to Iraq, to India, to Pakistan, to China, where do we get the moral authority then to be able to say, no, you should cease this kind of activity?It very quickly becomes an argument in which the Western Powers, those who are conceived of as the Western Powers by history, the imperialist colonial powers, are allowed to do as they will with respect to atomic or hydrogen testing and somehow, then, those countries which have been viewed as unindustrialized or Third World or whatever kind of set of adjectives are put upon them, those countries are disenabled from being able to do the same thing that France now carries on.France undermines everything that we have tried to do since atomic testing and hydrogen testing took place, since all of us, from President Kennedy on, on a bipartisan basis in this country, came to the conclusion that this was against the interests of humanity. This goes beyond individual political machinations or individual political posturing. This goes to the very heart of what constitutes a responsible nation in the present-day world acting in a manner in concordance with those actions that promote peace. We are not in a position, then, to complain to other countries about possible testing that they may be doing if we are unable to discipline ours sufficiently to be able to say to France, we will not countenance this.Now, it is one thing, perhaps, for the President to say, look, there are wider considerations. It may even be that the State Department wants to say there are wider considerations. That may be so. An argument may be made. I think it can be refuted and should be refuted. But I do not pretend to have some corner on the market of political wisdom in that respect. It perhaps should be debated.But, to have the Speaker's chair occupied, the podium of the House of Representatives occupied by the President of France under these circumstances is beyond my comprehension. It is a privilege of the House, a privilege of the House to stand on the podium where the Speaker resides and to speak to the House assembled.We are forced into the position of saying that we must boycott this speech, this address to the House of Representatives, and we request our I hope you will not resent the fact that I think we can go back a little further, World War I. Who was it that left the shores of the United States to go and rescue France in World War I? Who went to rescue France in World War II? And it is a sad chapter, one that still has not been resolved in our own country, who then, with the best of intentions, tried to go into Vietnam in the wake of the disaster that the French created there in Indochina? It was the United States, for good or for ill. We have no apologies that we need to make to the French about taking a position with respect to testing in the Pacific.Some could say to us, yes, of course, the gentleman from Samoa, the people from Hawaii, they live in the Pacific, I suppose we could be seen almost as a special interest in that regard.",

My good friend, the gentleman from American Samoa, has made it clear that the United States, too, is a Pacific Nation; that this is not some isolated event in a faroff place.I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that this is something that very much needs the bipartisan attention of the House. I would hope that the Speaker would reconsider the question of whether or not Mr. Chirac should be allowed to speak, because I maintain that far from being a scientific test, that the information that could have been gained from the testing, ostensibly gained from the testing, we would have been happy to share. The United States of America would have been happy to share.I can say as a member of the Committee on National Security, without violating any sense of clearances or restricted data or anything of the kind, classified data, the information to be gained here is common knowledge to those who will take the time to find out what was required or what kind of knowledge was sought with respect to the effects of this kind of testing, if that was indeed the rationale for it.I maintain, Mr. Speaker, that this was a political statement by the French. They were doing this for political reasons, and precisely because, and I will not dispute anyone with whether or not this was a good political idea or a bad political idea. It was done for reasons that seemed good enough at the time to the French Government, and as a result, and whatever statement they wanted to make, they were willing to take the chance of opprobrium from the rest of the world if they went ahead with these tests in order to make their political statement.I maintain, Mr. Speaker, and I would hope that the leadership of the House would take this into account with respect to my request for reconsideration of whether this speech moves forward, it is a political statement to have someone stand at the Speaker's desk, at the Speaker's chair and the podium, on the floor of the House of Representatives. That is a political statement. It says that you have the privilege of the floor, freely granted by the Members of this House. That I was a political statement.So if the French exploded these bombs for political reasons, are we not saying, then, if we give him the privilege of the floor, that we are, in effect, approving that; that he can do this with no political disadvantage, there is no political price to pay?All we ask, Mr. Speaker, and perhaps there is a protocol situation that the Speaker cannot now rescind, and perhaps not all of this was taken into consideration, but I ask this, then: If the privilege of the floor cannot be rescinded at this time, and I most seriously and parenthetically emphasize, reemphasize, reiterate, that I hope the Speaker and the leadership will reconsider the question of whether Mr. Chirac should be given the privilege of this House to speak from the Speaker's podium.But in the event that that is not possible, I ask, because it is a political statement and will be a political statement to be on this floor, that people boycott this floor; that the cameras that will be in here to record this event ",

The President, and the gentleman and the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Ms. DeLauro] have been on this floor with me many times in this special order process, and I think we would agree, and I think the Record would reflect, that over and over and over again at that podium and at that podium on the other side of the aisle the mantra was enunciated: ``Give us a balanced budget as scored by the Congressional Budget Office in 7 years, to be enacted in the year 2002, and that's the end of it for us. That is all we want the President to do. That's all we want the Democratic Party to do, give us a balanced budget in 7 years as certified by the Congressional Budget Office.''Now, my understanding is, and I think I can read as well as, certainly, the Speaker of the House can, I think my academic credentials are in at least as much order as his, the President did precisely that. He presented a 7-year balanced budget as certified by the Congressional Budget Office. The problem was the Speaker did not like the numbers or how it was achieved, so he moved the goalposts.",

He managed to do that.Now, the fact that the Speaker is upset that the President actually accommodated him on what was requested, he is attempting to recoup by attaching his desires not with respect to a balanced budget, but some new prospect for a balanced budget that remains beyond me in terms of how he wants to accomplish it, by attaching it to the debt resolution.",

Well, I take it similarly as a compliment to be on Mr. Gingrich's target list.Mr. Speaker, I notice that one of our colleagues has come to the floor. I take it that he is maybe making an inquiry whether he might have been able to take some of the time from one of the previous speakers from the Republican side.Have I guessed correctly on that?",

    "text": "Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.I think that was a good example, Mr. Speaker, of the fact that we do have comity on this floor. Some of our colleagues might think we are spelling that ``comedy'' rather than ``comity'' but I think that you and I both are committed to this institution.I have been the beneficiary of your wisdom, Mr. Speaker, and your leadership in this House, and I would hope that I could make a similar contribution in whatever role I find myself on this floor or in any committee, in any post. I think we both view this as a privilege that has been given to us, an honor bestowed by the voters in our districts. But as I indicated, nonetheless, this is an institution in which the politics of this country are played out in a setting which I think is most appropriate for coming to those decisions.In the process of engaging in political debate, inevitably sides are taken. I think perhaps that is one of the reasons why for some individuals they fail to understand that, the proposition, well, why can they not all get along? Why is there what is called bickering?I would hope, Mr. Speaker, you and I have never been in a position of bickering with one another. I think we have probably had a division of thought and philosophy and possibly policy at one time or another, and other times we were not only able to agree but to work in concert with one another toward a common goal, seeking to achieve it. Nonetheless, there are different political philosophies that are put forward by individuals who put themselves up for public office, and people make a decision on those philosophies.So as a result, we often find ourselves in opposition to one another, not necessarily personally, Mr. Speaker, but in terms of political parties and policies that might or might not be pursued.I say all of this by way of preliminary remarks because, as I indicated before my friend from Connecticut came to the floor, there was this list that was put together. I suppose it had a bit of drama attached to it because of the press, journalists categorizing it a certain way, but it was called the enemies list and it was associated with Well, for the 1990's, we have a list, too. The Speaker of the House, Mr. Gingrich, has put together a list, a target list, for next year--I should say for this year, rather--for the congressional elections this year, some 20 to 30 Members of the Congress who are being targeted by Mr. Gingrich for defeat in November for one reason and another, I presume perhaps because of opposition on policies, perhaps, I would hope, effective refutation of the Speaker's positions.In any event, I find myself on that list. I am one of the Speaker's targets this year. I am on the Gingrich target list. I do take that as a compliment. I am very pleased to be on it. I trust and hope that perhaps some of the commentary that I have been making on the budget, and on what I see as the lack of solid policy on Mr. Gingrich's part and his leadership with respect to the budget, I hope that some of the things I have had to say have led him to designate me as a target in this upcoming election.I am very pleased to be recognized. It is not always those of us from some of the smaller States at such great distance, particularly being out in Hawaii, where we would certainly welcome the Speaker after the election in November, hopefully as the ex-Speaker. We will be happy to have him come out and take a little rest with us out there, and I will be happy to provide some hospitality for him, and I certainly hope to be in the victors column when that election takes place despite being a target.But I bring this up about being a target because I do not want to deceive any one of our colleagues who may be tuned in, or others who may have access to our deliberations here, that I am anything other than partisan when it comes to defending what I believe are the interests of the people of the United States, the public interest of the United States with respect to the budget and with respect to the other issues that I have a difference with the Speaker on, and apparently have contributed to me being this target.As the target, I invite the Speaker yet once again to come to the floor. I have done this in the past and do it now.I recall at one point being in the chair, even as the Speaker is now, and had the opportunity to listen to with great interest, Mr. Gingrich's recitation on various subject matters having to do with policy. He has indicated that as Speaker that he does not deal with the day-to-day floor activity here. He has entrusted that to Mr. Armey and his whip structure.He says now that the deal, the supposed deal or the possibility of a deal on the budget has broken down with the White House. So he does not have anyplace to go, I guess, in the afternoons now that he is not speaking with Mr. Clinton, so he should have the time to come down here.Inasmuch as I am going to be a target, I would like to deal with the issues that apparently have upset him, particularly with regard to the budget or any other issue that has caused me to be put into this position by Mr. Gingrich. I invite him to do so. I would like to think that our academic backgrounds, perhaps, might be an inducement to lecture. I suppose some people might see what we are doing here in special orders as lectures, but that is all right. I think it is good to have the opportunity to lay out, in a detailed and comprehensive way, one's position.So I invite him once again and would be happy to see him and yield him time, any time that he wishes to take advantage of it.In the meantime, let me then state a couple of propositions with respect to the budget process and build upon the commentary that I have made to this point. Mr. Speaker, perhaps you recall a bit of my discussion with the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Doggett, in the hour just passed in which I indicated that I thought perhaps, I will not say the Speaker, Speaker Gingrich, misspoke himself, but perhaps I would characterize it as being a bid disingenuous in indicating to the public that he thought that is was not possible to have a balanced budget agreement with the President this year.Now, I am sure you will agree, Mr. Speaker, that I have been very reluctant to endorse the bona fides, if you will, of a 7-year balanced budget agreement, whether it was certified by the Congressional Budget Office or by the Office of Management and Budget which is the Executive accountants, if you will, the scorekeeper. The Congressional Budget Office is our; the Congress', the Legislative scorekeepers. I am reluctant to believe that this could be done without causing a great deal of pain regardless of whether it is a Democratic budget, Republican budget or anybody else's budget. But nonetheless, the indications from the Republican side of the aisle, from the office of the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Gingrich], was that if the President would only present to the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Gingrich] a 7-year balanced budget as certified by the Congressional Budget Office, that that would be sufficient unto the day, that would involve the kinds of savings the Speaker was looking for, et cetera. Over and over again, the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Gingrich] and other Members of the majority would come to the floor and state with no equivocation, ``Just give us a 7-year balanced budget as certified by the Congressional Budget Office, and have got a deal.''Well, Mr. Clinton did that. I have my reservations about the bookkeeping, as I indicated, in that just as I do with the Republican proposal. I think I have gone over that in detail before. There are all kinds of gimmicks associated with it. There are all kinds of bookkeeping maneuvers and tricks, all kinds of accounting gambits that put such a budget together.For example, what is called backloading or a look-back provision; in other words, you do not really make the savings until 3, 4, 5, 6 years from now when you have already gone through a presidential election, when you are going to go through two, possible three, congressional elections, when you cannot quite be sure what the economic stability or instability of the country might be.Mr. Speaker, I noticed my good friend from American Samoa is here. I noticed that you had called his name previously, and he is only able to arrive right now.Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from American Samoa.",

    "text": "I thank you very much.That bit of Socratic dialog, Mr. Speaker, I think has stated the essence of it.Now, obviously any of our colleagues who were tuned in can say, well this is just a partisan observation or series of partisan observations by myself and the gentleman from Samoa, and that is OK. It does not bother me any it would be seen as partisan.The problem is, is it fair, is it accurate, is it factual? I will not say truthful. Truthful is always a matter of debate. What the truth is, is a matter of debate.I do think that people nonetheless come to conclusions. They nonetheless reserve judgment, if they are prudent, and when they think that they have heard the facts and contemplated the factual basis for a judgment, they then make it.Now let us take somebody outside the political system itself, the electoral system, and see what they have to say about it. I am referring now to Jodie Allen. I do not know Jodie Allen, if he is male or female. I have not met Mr. or Ms. Allen. All I know is Jodie Allen is editor of the Outlook section of the Washington Post where columnists are found of a Sunday.I do not blame Jodie Allen one way or another for the headlines. I think, Mr. Speaker, you and I are sufficiently well versed in dealing with newspapers as elected officials to know that the person who writes the story does not necessarily write the headline, and the headline does not necessarily refer to what is in the story, and you can find yourself reeling from what it says, but these headlines over the Allen columns say, ``Who won the budget battle?'' The sub headline is: ``Clinton's phony plan beats the GOP's phony plan.'' So I would guess that Jodie Allen has not got too much good to say about either. I will not say either of us, Mr. Speaker, but about either of these plans.But the whole point of the headline, I think, is to try and summarize the position of the Allen editorial which nonetheless contains some very interesting material which I would like to quote very briefly in what will be a series of remarks from me in time to come with respect to the budget and its realities as well as the debt limit and its connection to the budget.Just the opening commentary, and I am quoting now from Jodie Allen's editorial of January 28 in the Washington Post Outlook section, ``To hear the President tell it in his masterfully ingratiating State of the Union message last week, the country came very close to solving its Federal budget problem once and for all.''Quoting further then the President within the column, ```There is now broad bipartisan agreement that permanent deficit spending must come to an end,' said President Clinton last Tuesday evening,''' again quoting, ```though differences remain among us which are significant.' He also noted, `The combined total of the proposed savings that are in common to both, that is to say, the White House and the congressional Republican plans, is more than enough using numbers from your Congressional Budget Office to balance the budget in 7 years and provide a modest tax cut. These cuts are real.' '' Jodie Allen then goes on to say, ``Are they? It is a question worth asking as the country, having clearly decided the President got the best of Congress in the blame affixing event tries to decide whether it should now care that the overall competition has been called on account of political rain. In fact, the details of the competing proposals suggest that at least as far as the cause of fiscal solvency is concerned, less has been lost than either side would care to admit. No doubt some elements in both plans are real enough. Both sides, for example, were and apparently still are, determined to give out a pre-election tax cut, deficit be damned. It is also a pretty safe bet the agreements Congress extracts from the President in return for allowing the Government to keep running and borrowing more money will make substantial cuts in the immediate operating budgets of the many Federal agencies. Beyond that,'' and I think this is the important point here, I say parenthetically, ``Beyond that, things get a lot less real. For example, even had the White House embraced the GOP's harshest cuts, the deficit would still be upwards of $150 billion this fiscal year and still higher in 1997. By the end of the century, it might or might not dip below $100 billion. After that further progress against the deficit would likely be arrested and ultimately reversed under either plan'' from the Jodie Allen column.Mr. Speaker, that has been the essence of the observations that I have made from this podium again and again during this whole budget process. I have maintained from this podium, while all of the broader discussion is going on, about the balanced budget and all the posturing was taking place and all the puffed up rhetoric was being stated on this floor and in press conferences and covered by television cameras and radio microphones with breathless anticipation, nobody wanted to talk about the fact that regardless of what kind of balanced budget proposal was coming forward, it was actually increasing the deficit.I will state without equivocation again: No one can come to this floor, at least no one has to this point, despite my invitations again and again and again, to refute the position that I am maintaining that there has not been a balanced budget proposal put forward by anybody of either party that will stand the scrutiny of an honest appraisal as to whether or not it is increasing the deficit.It might be possible, Mr. Speaker, to achieve a balanced budget at some The question is, are you able to pay? Can you acquire debt in such a way and such a manner and for such a length of time that enables those or that institution doing the lending to be reasonably sure you are going to be able to make the payment, be able to sustain the debt, and sustain your life and its requirements monetarily.That is all this is about. I do not think that can be done in 7 years, but I am in the minority. I have been in legislative life in a State legislature, in the house of representatives at the State level and the State senate, in a city council, and in the Congress of the United States. I have been part of the board of directors of nonprofit organizations in many venues, Mr. Speaker. In other words, just about every community and electoral venue there is, I have participated in a legislative function where you had to deal with budgets, where you had to deal with coming to grips in most of those instances with balancing the budget.I have participated both as the chairman of an authorizing committee and as a member of an appropriations committee in balancing budgets in every legislative venue. So this is not something strange and new to me. I have better than two decades of experience in this area. So I am quite willing to come to grips with the idea that I am in the minority on this floor with the question of the number of years that should be reasonably made available to deal with the balanced budget.But I am not required, Mr. Speaker, simply because I am in the minority at the moment with respect to the numbers of years that would be required to do this, I am not required in that context to keep quiet about the fact that those who are putting forward a proposal that they can balance in 7 years cannot do it, and that to delude the American people, deliberately or otherwise, I am not trying to at this juncture cast some sort of aspersions on those who say they want to attempt it at least. All well and good, if that is what the proposition is.If someone wants to come to the floor and say no, I do not think it can be done, or on paper it cannot be done in 7 years if we are being honest about it, and the word ``honesty'' has been used over and over and over again on this floor, we want honest numbers. If that is the case, fine. You want to make an attempt over 7 years to do it, possibly it could be done. I think it would entail the kind of cuts that would cause incredible pain to people in all kinds of areas.Part of the pain that would come would come after 2002, after the 7-year period, when I am maintaining, and I think the burden of the rest of the article by Jodie Allen is that once you pass 2002, to the degree that you are able to achieve anywhere near the kind of goal that has been set in 1996 over that period of time, that 7-year period of time, there will be an explosion of debt, an explosion of indebtedness, an explosion of deficit spending.One of the categories that would, I think, harm us the most would be in Social Security. The Allen article, again I am citing it because I wanted this to be an outside person. It justifies not Neil Abercrombie by standing up here and tossing out facts and figures as suit me and then could be dismissed as a result of simply being partisan, no matter how accurate it might be. I am citing these columns, and I am glad to see the Jodie Allens and some of the other people I am going to be citing are beginning to pick this commentary up. I will be going over that in greater detail in time to come.Mr. Speaker, I believe my half hour is almost up. Let me conclude simply by saying that it is not a question of who wins the budget battle, it is a question of who loses. If the American people lose the budget battle, believe me, we all lose here politically. I hope in days to come to be able to shed a little more light on not only what the process is to this point, but what we can do about it in a practical way to bring a successful conclusion to this budget confrontation.",

    "text": "I thank the Chair.I wish to address that quite directly, Mr. Speaker, because I believe that the issue under consideration as embodied in the privileged resolution most certainly is in order to be discussed, should we pass this privileged resolution, and the decision as to whether or not we should pass the privileged resolution and whether or not we should pass the privileged resolution and whether it is properly before us is yours to make.I would like to argue, Mr. Speaker, as follows: That in the House rules and manual which the Parliamentarian has been kind enough to provide to me, there are numerous citations in here with respect to precedents as to the question of personal privilege, questions of privilege, in the absence of a quorum, et cetera.But fundamentally and elementally what is before the Chair is as follows: The question of privilege shall be first those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, integrity of its proceedings.I do not think that is necessarily at issue here. Probably a rather abstract argument or intellectual argument could be made it is.But I rest my case to the Chair on the second part, those affecting the rights, reputation, and conduct of Members individually in their representative capacity only.Mr. Speaker, we have in the Pacific, aside from the representation with the capacity to vote on this floor existing in Hawaii, Members from Guam and American Samoa. In addition, we have certain jurisdiction over island groupings in the Pacific under the Department of the Interior.Mr. Speaker, I maintain to the Chair and to the Members that the rights and reputation and conduct of Members individually in their representative capacity is seriously impaired if they cannot succeed in being able to make an argument to the floor Members assembled as to whether or not Mr. Chirac should be able to appear.I do believe it is well within the boundaries, because those Members cannot vote on this floor. Their representative capacity is solely on the basis of being able to persuade us on behalf of the peoples of the Pacific that there are matters which require our attention. This privileged resolution is directed exactly at that issue. Questions about radioactivity, and so forth, would be discussed under that privileged resolution as to why an affirmative vote is sought.So, Mr. Speaker, I most sincerely request your favorable ruling with respect to the question of privilege, and ask that it be allowed to be voted on, because this is the only way that the peoples of the Pacific, through their representatives, particularly from Guam and American Samoa, who do not have the right to vote on this floor, will be able to make a representation that they are otherwise obligated and required to do so by virtue of their presence here on the floor.It is clear, it seems to me, given the massive implications of radioactive leakage in the Pacific with the numerous explosions that have taken place in these tests, that other than through this representation through the privileged motion, the desirability or undesirability of having Mr. Chirac speak will not be able to be adequately addressed, and it seems to me a very powerful argument can be made for that, should we be allowed to proceed.",

If I could have or someone else could have come to this floor and made such a representation as you indicate, I will accept that.However, the rules also allow us to bring a privileged resolution to the floor at any time with the proper notice and to have it considered. One of the reasons or the principal reason that the Chair stated for turning down this privileged resolution offered by the gentlewoman from Hawaii [Mrs. Mink] is that it was not presented on January 26. From what the Chair just told me, it does not matter that it was not presented on January 26. It could have been presented on January 26, but it was not imperative that it be presented on January 26. So if that is the only reason, why can it not be presented today?",

    "title": "BUDGET MATTERS",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, in light of Ms. Norton's just-delivered remarks, I would like to say as someone coming from the last State to be admitted to the Union, the State of Hawaii, that I recognize only too fully what the implications are when you find yourself without representation, when you find yourself having to look to the good will of others.In this particular instance, Mr. Speaker, I think that we need to pay some final attention before we leave the building, before we leave the floor, and pay some particular attention to the proposition, is this actually what we should be doing?I do not mean tonight, Mr. Speaker. I think that the majority party, the Republican Party, and the House, have the opportunity to reconsider in the next day or two whether we want to go home, whether we need to go home bearing the burden of not having resolved the question of the debt limit.Now, we have had arguments made, we can show headlines and present charts indicating that there was ostensibly a breakdown in the budget negotiations. The budget negotiations, I submit, Mr. Speaker, are separate and apart from those negotiations that might occur or should be occurring with respect to the extension of the debt limit.In that regard, Mr. Speaker, I do not think they should be connected.I have listened with care. I have listened with intensity today to the arguments being made. As you know, earlier today, in the absence of immediate legislative business, there was quite an extensive discussion of some hours' length on the floor by various Members with respect to the question of debt limitation, balancing of the budget, and the implications for tax credits or tax cuts.Mr. Speaker, you may recall that I finished a special order just the other day, if you will, paraphrasing the title of an editorial to which I was referring in the Washington Post, the title being ``Who won the budget battle?'' I finished by saying the real question, Mr. Speaker, was who might lose in the budget battle? That is what really counts.We do not want anybody to lose in that budget battle, because we are talking about not only the future, which has been brought up many times by speakers on both sides of the aisle, children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, who will pay, but, rather, what will be lost in terms of what has been referred to over and over again as the full faith and credit of the United States with respect to paying its debts.Mr. Speaker, I submit there are two separate issues here that you and I, either individually, as Members of this body, or as representatives of positions in both caucuses can have, of fruitful discussion on this floor and in the context of the House of Representatives, institutionally speaking, as to what the best course of action is or should be with respect either to the budget or the debt limit.But to argue or make the debt limit extension part of that discussion at the present time I think advances no one's agenda, Mr. Speaker. Not mine. I do not come down to the floor to try and make a political game, rhetorically or otherwise, over arguing this issue. It is much too important, bigger than you or I.So I would hope that there would be consideration in the Republican Conference in the hours and immediate days to come, or, if we do leave without resolving the issue, that there would be a consideration that at least as far as the debt limit is concerned, that for now we set that aside as not being relevant to resolving the very real differences that may be between us politically or otherwise in terms of policy, and that we put the health and welfare literally of the Nation ahead of or at the top of all our priority lists, of all political parties concerned; that we separate that out, and that we have a full and fair discussion, not about the credit standing of the United States, but what kind of credit we can bring to ourselves as Members of this body, and what kind of credibility we can bring to the arguments that we are able to make about the budget: How we balance it, what we do about that, what we do about tax credits, what we do about whether or not there should be tax cuts; and that we argue this thing in a manner and in a context that establishes for the people of the United States, our colleagues, and those who may be viewing or observing our deliberations, that we do it in such a manner and in a context that reflects well not just on us, but on the seriousness of the issues at hand.With that, Mr. Speaker, I close by reiterating my plea that we do not utilize the debt limit extension as one of the fundamental blocks in the building of whatever political stance we may take with respect to balancing the budget or any other aspect of the political discussion that has been under way in these last days.",

    "title": "AGRICULTURAL MARKET TRANSITION ACT",
    "text": "Mr. Chairman, we have heard a discussion tonight about jobs, and I would say from my observation of the Republican primaries that I expect that Mr. Buchanan and others that are concerned about jobs in this country are going to be watching the result of this debate, because when you talk about cheap sugar you are talking about slave labor. You are talking about exporting jobs of Americans overseas. Make no mistake about it, a yes vote on this is going to be interpreted as being against the American worker, because when you go overseas to get that cheap sugar you are where there are no labor standards. There are no health standards. There are no environmental standards. There are no safety standards.We fought a war in this country to end slavery, and yet we are telling ourselves that in order to have cheaper sugar we are going to import slave labor sugar from people around the world who are being devoured by oligarchs, sugar oligarchs who have made it their business to destroy their people. They will destroy this country.Do the Members think that refineries are going to exist in this country when cheap sugar that is harvested by slave labor can go into a refinery in that country? That is what is going to happen. This is about jobs in this country. Urban Members of both sides of the aisle say that they are going to find cheaper sugar products in this country. Not only is that not true, but it is undercutting the people who are the best producers of sugar in the world. This is a jobs program. Vote for American workers. Vote down this amendment.Mr. Chairman, let me say first and foremost, if I had my way we would leave the no-cost sugar program alone. However, people asked for reform. The end product we have in the H.R. 2854, the Agricultural Market Transition Act, is reform. Domestic marketing allotments are eliminated. The loan rate will effectively be reduced. The marketing assessment paid by growers for deficit reduction purposes is increased 25 percent. The foreign sugar import level is raised by 20 percent. Yet, the no-cost provision which has been in effect since 1985 is still maintained. So if reform is what you want, reform is what you got.Mr. Chairman, for over 150 years, sugar has been grown in the State of Hawaii. Sugar has played a major role in the historical, cultural, and economic development of Hawaii. However, the survival of sugar is now in question. Over the past decade, sugar production in Hawaii has dropped drastically. In 1986, over 1 million tons of sugar was produced. In 1995, the amount will be approximately 492,000 tons.If Hawaii sugar producers were inefficient or unproductive I could not support the sugar program. Yet, the data proves that the Hawaii yields of sugar are among the highest in the world, about 10.5 tons an acre in 1993. In addition, Hawaii's sugar field workers have the highest standard of living of any agricultural workers in the world. The only way the world sugar market competes with our domestic sugar industry is to artificially subsidize their sugar industry and to utilize slave labor. Foreign competitors do not have to comply with Federal and State standards for worker safety, wage and healthcare benefits, and for environmental protection. The concept of free trade is splendid, but for sugar it is a fantasy. One on one on a level playing field Hawaii sugar producers can beat anyone.In fact, according to a 1994 Landell Mills Commodities Studies the evidence reveals the United States to be the second lowest cost among the world's 31 major beet-producing countries, and 29th among 62 cane producing countries. Among the world's 13 producers of corn sweetener, the United States ranks as the absolute lowest cost.This Nation's highly efficient sugar farmers are ready, willing, and able to compete against foreign farmers. Until a level playing field exists, however, it would be a mistake to dismantle a successful sugar policy while other nations continue their market-distorting habits at America's expense.Mr. Chairman, during the debate someone may bring up the Sweetener Users' Association, which represents the big, multinational food, candy and soda corporations, poster child--Bob's Candy of Albany, GA. As they go on to say, if sugar weren't so costly in the United States, they could stay competitive and not be forced to move jobs overseas. It is the sugar, says Bob's Candy. It costs too much here in America. Bob's Candy is forced to move operations to Jamaica because sugar is cheaper there.Well, my colleagues, let me tell you the rest of the story.Could it be there are other factors that brought Bob's Candy to Jamaica? Like, maybe the fact that Bob doesn't have to pay his Jamaican employees anything near what he's paying his Georgia employees? Or perhaps, because there's no NLRB, no OSHA, no EPA, no Medicare payroll taxes to contend with in Jamaica? Could any of these factors have played a role in Bob's decision to locate in Jamaica--or was it just the price of sugar, as big sweetener users say.Incidentally, according to Dunn &amp; Bradstreet, Bob's Candy is in the top 25 percent in terms of profitability of all American candy makers.Bob's Candy is simply a case of a profitable candy maker trying to use the sugar program as a convenient scapegoat for its decision to Well, I don't buy it--and neither should the American public.Mr. Chairman and my House colleagues, support good policy, support American jobs, support the American economy. Vote against the Miller-Schumer amendment: immediate disaster, disguised as transition.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, article I, section 2 of the Constitution requires the House of Representatives to choose a Speaker. It is customary at the commencement of every Congress for members of each party to vote for the candidate decided upon by his or her caucus. Because governance of the House conforms to the democratic principles which undergird our Republic, there is no doubt that the votes of the majority will determine who shall be our Speaker.Today, however, we are choosing a presiding officer in unprecedented circumstances. Never before has there been an election for Speaker in which one of the candidates stands formally accused by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct of violating the rules of the House. It is not my intention today to argue the merits of the charges against the gentleman from Georgia or what if any sanctions should be imposed. I focus instead on the implications of the committee's statement of alleged violation for today's election for Speaker, for the Speakership as an institution, for the House of Representatives, and for our Nation itself.The facts are these: The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct alleges that the gentleman from Georgia violated the rules of the House. As of this date the committee has not completed its consideration of the case, and no resolution has been achieved. When resolution does occur, it may very well involve sanctions which make the gentleman from Georgia ineligible to hold the post of Speaker.Removal of a Speaker under those conditions would be debilitating for the House and the Nation. It would cause chaos within the House and further undermine public confidence in democratic institutions. Even if resolution of the case against the gentleman from Georgia does not result in his ineligibility for the Speakership, his election as Speaker at this time would be inadvisable for two reasons: No. 1, the time, attention, and energy he must devote to his case will diminish the personal resources available for the discharge of his duties as Speaker of the House; and No. 2, the shadow of doubt and suspicion cast by the proceedings against him will undoubtedly fall on every action of the House and bring into question the integrity of this institution.I believe, therefore, that until the case against the gentleman from Georgia is resolved, the House should choose an interim Speaker. I reiterate my acknowledgement that the majority has the right to determine who that individual shall be. However, in order to ensure that the business of the House is conducted in an undistracted manner, free of doubts about the integrity of the institution and its governance, that person should be someone not involved in the ethical issues in which the gentleman from Georgia finds himself enmeshed.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Library of Congress, the Bishop Museum Film Archives, and other institutions, organizations, and individuals who are working to preserve the rich film heritage of this great Nation. The Library of Congress is host to the National Film Preservation Board which advises the Librarian of Congress on selections to the National Film Registry and on national film preservation policy. Through the generosity of the James Madison Council and support from leading directors committed to film preservation, the Library of Congress is sponsoring its second season of the National Film Registry tour. The tour showcases 26 feature films and 10 short subjects from the National Film Registry in their original 35 millimeter or 16 millimeter formats. The American public can enjoy a unique opportunity to sample films from the Library's collections. During its first season, the tour hosted public screenings of a broad variety of classic American films in eight cities across the country.Each year, the board, members of the public, and the Librarian of Congress select up to 25 films for inclusion on the Registry. The films chosen are not necessarily the best American films ever made nor the most famous. Under the terms of the National Film Preservation Act, films selected for the Registry are those that continue to have enduring cultural, historical, or aesthetic significance.Created in 1988, the National Film Preservation Board recognizes the vital contribution of film to the American heritage. The perilous state of America's film heritage was documented by the Library and the National Film Preservation Board in ``Film Preservation 1993: A Study of the Current State of American Film Preservation.'' More than half of all American films made before 1951 are lost forever. Film is a fragile medium, and motion pictures, both old and new, face deterioration problems. Only by storing films in low-temperature and low-humidity environments can the decay process be slowed. The majority of American films do not receive this care and are in critical need of preservation.The National Film Registry Tour pays tribute to American filmmaking and promotes public awareness of the need to protect and preserve America's film heritage. As Dr. Billington notes, ``The moving picture is not so much the art form as the language of our time. Motion pictures provide an unparalleled record of American life and culture. If we can preserve these films, researchers will have the sights and sounds that flesh out the written record of great events and everyday life.'' Of special significance when the tour stopped in Honolulu earlier this month was the screening of Hawaiian regional films including ``This is America'' (1947), which urges support of Hawaii statehood. One highlight of this event was the Library's donation of a new 16 millimeter print of a pre-1915 film shot in Hawaii (featuring substantial footage shot by the Thomas Edison Company in 1906) to the Bishop Museum Archives.I urge my colleagues to join me in applauding the efforts of the Library of Congress, the Bishop Museum Film Archives, the International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House, the Museum of Modern Art Department of Film and Video, the UCLA Film and Television Archive, and all others involved in this important work.",

    "title": "GRANTING CONSENT TO CERTAIN AMENDMENTS ENACTED BY THE HAWAII LEGISLATURE TO HAWAIIAN HOMES COMMISSION ACT OF 1920",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for offering me the opportunity to explain this resolution.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my joint resolution, House Joint Resolution 32, to consent to certain amendments by the legislature of the State of Hawaii to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920.Over 75 years have elapsed since Congress passed the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920. Under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, approximately 203,500 acres of public lands was set aside for the rehabilitation of native Hawaiians through a Government-sponsored homesteading project.Two major factors prompted Congress to pass this act. First, native Hawaiians were a dying race. Population data showed that the number of full-blooded Hawaiians in the territory, the then-territory of Hawaii, had decreased from an 1826 estimate of 142,650 to 22,600 in 1919.Second, Congress saw that previous systems of land distribution were ineffective when judged practically by the benefits accruing to native Hawaiians. The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act was originally intended for rural homesteading; that is, for native Hawaiians to leave urban areas and return to lands to become subsistence or commercial farmers and ranchers.Yet the demand of native Hawaiians for residential house lots has far exceeded the demand for agricultural or pastoral lots.The Hawaii Statehood Act of 1959 shifted the responsibility for the administration of the Hawaii Homes Commission Act from the Territory to the State of Hawaii. In accordance with the Statehood Act, title to the available lands was transferred to the new State. The Statehood Act, however, also included certain requirements regarding the State of Hawaii's administration of the Hawaii homes program, and it is these that give rise to joint resolution.Section 4 of the Hawaii Statehood Act provides that, and I quote, ``the consent of the United States,'' unquote, would be required for certain amendments by the State to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act. As part of the administrative responsibility the Department of the Interior undertook in 1983 as, quote, ``lead Federal agency,'' unquote, for purposes of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, the department and the Governor of Hawaii informally agreed in 1987 to a procedure under which the department would become involved in securing consent to State amendments to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act. Congress has previously enacted two statutes consenting to various amendments to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act by the State of Hawaii: Public Laws 99-577 and 100-398.Generally, it has been the position of the Department of the Interior in connection with State amendments to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act to refrain from second-guessing the Hawaii State Legislature and Governor of Hawaii with respect to merits of the amendments.The following two amendments have been determined to require the consent of the United States and again by extension therefore are meeting on the floor today on this resolution:One of them is Act 339 of the Session Laws of Hawaii, 1993. This statute establishes the Hawaiian Hurricane Relief Fund. Section 7 authorized the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands to obtain homeowner's insurance coverage for lessees and to issue revenue bonds. Section 15 of the bill consists of a severability clause which provides that consent requirement, if any, that applies to the Hawaiian Home Lands provisions of the act shall not be deemed to have the validity of the other provisions of the act. The Department of the Interior has taken the position that State enactments which include a severability clause, in the exercise of caution, be submitted to Congress for approval.The second measure, Mr. Speaker, is Act 37 of the Session Laws of 1994. This statute allows homestead lessees to designate as a successor to the lease a grandchild who is at least 25 percent native Hawaiian. Under the current law, as adopted by Hawaii in 1982, a lessee may designate his or her spouse or children as a successor under the lease if they are 25 percent native Hawaiian. The bill would thus allow a similar designation with respect to grandchildren. The Department of the Interior concurs with the State's position that congressional consent is required for this legislation in that it amends the 50-percent blood quantum requirement included in the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act.So in summary, Mr. Speaker, these two measures involve the establishment of Hawaiian Hurricane Act, obviously we are subject to such phenomenon, natural phenomena in the Hawaiian Islands, and it is necessary for us to establish that fund. And by extension, for the reasons mentioned, to request the United States, that is, the House of Representatives and the Senate, to concur. And second, to provide an opportunity because of the passage of time for lessees to designate their grandchildren as well as their spouse or children if they meet the 25 percent native Hawaiian requirement.For these reasons and with respect to that history and legacy of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support these worthwhile measures.",

We need to keep in mind that the act was passed originally in 1920 and that native Hawaiians themselves are coming to grips with this question, and we hope for a resolution that may find its way for presentation to this body in the near future.With that, Mr. Speaker, I request a favorable attention of the Members of the House to this resolution and I hope that it will receive the necessary votes in order to pass. The people of Hawaii will be very grateful for that outcome, and native Hawaiians in particular will be the beneficiaries.Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for his remarks and his insight.

I commend him for his efforts to draw attention to the significance of the Asia-Pacific region.This resolution highlights the unique and important relationship between the United States and Japan. It also addresses the important role that the people of Okinawa have played in ensuring peace and stability in the region.The significance of the Asia-Pacific region will continue to grow in the 21st century. As we continue to review the defense treaty between the United States and Japan, it is important that the people of Japan know that we are committed to the long-term stability of the region. The United States-Japan relationship remains the cornerstone of our engagement in the region.As a nation, we must continue to strengthen our ties with Japan. In Hawaii, the stability of our economy is tied to the stability of the region and largely to Japan. The people of Hawaii have developed broadbased ties with Japan, to include a strong relationship with the Prefecture of Okinawa.As a result of these ties, the people of Hawaii continue to be concerned about the land issues being addressed in Okinawa with regard to basing of United States military forces. Unfortunately, it took the rape of a 12-year-old school girl in 1995 to turn the attention of the world toward the issues raised in Okinawa with respect to their land use concerns. Today, we are making steady progress on these very sensitive issues which need to be resolved between the Okinawa Prefecture and the Government of Japan.It is no exaggeration to say that Okinawa's people view their homeland as occupied territory. They see the overwhelming presence of United States military forces there as confirmation and they remain the poorest prefecture in Japan.Some 50 years after the end of World War II in the Pacific, Okinawa is the only unresolved residual issue of any significance between Japan and the United States. The people of Okinawa are the least culpable of all those thrust into World War II. For centuries past, they have been known in the region for promoting peace. They are friendly to the interests and people of the United States. Yet they bear the most burden generations later.They have given up a great deal in terms of economic prosperity and deserve to be recognized for their contributions toward ensuring the treaty's implementation and regional peace and security.",

I do not know if we are ever going to achieve that position again.We may want to pause for a moment of silence at this point, reverence for the question of bipartisanship. It surely can take place and it does take place over the African elephant. I think we could probably extend that to the donkey and the elephant in the United States, but I am not sure about the former as opposed to the latter.In any event, Mr. Speaker, it is the African Elephant Conservation Reauthorization Act, and it is literally deadly serious business we are about on this floor today.I support the African Elephant Conservation Act and its purpose in perpetuating healthy populations of African elephants. I am concerned that other U.S. funded programs that may impact the African elephant may not be working towards this purpose as expressed by the act. I hope that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the United States Agency for International Development will work cooperatively towards the ends of African elephant conservation.I appreciate the importance of the Speaker, the chairman and the subcommittee chair, the importance which the Speaker and the chairman and the subcommittee chair place on conserving African elephants, and I most certainly commend them for moving expeditiously to reauthorize the African Elephant Conservation Act.I would hope, Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, especially that the young people of this country would pay particular attention, given the fact that we have before us the situation with the panda at the Washington Zoo now undergoing an operation with species throughout the United States and the rest of the world in zoos finding themselves under extreme stress and duress. With populations of animals such as the elephant experiencing similar calamities and difficulties throughout the world, I think that it is incumbent upon us to help other nations and other people find ways to have conservation and preservation efforts be made manifest in more than just the abstract.We do not want to find ourselves reduced to finding reruns of National Geographic specials or Discovery Channel programs constituting or, for that matter, observing animal acts in Las Vegas as the sole preservation effort that is made by this species with regard to the rest of the species on the planet.This particular act, this reauthorization act, is a serious effort made on a bipartisan basis by serious minded Members who want to see to it that we set a standard; with this act we are doing it. If we can take similar measures with other species throughout the world, I look forward to the time when we can say with some confidence that we have made moves and taken steps to see to it that conservation is more than just a word.I commend the gentleman from New Jersey, [Mr. Saxton], for bringing this bill forward and am very grateful for the cooperation that he and the staff of the committee have extended on this bill and for all the Members who have expressed support.",

    "title": "JUVENILE CRIME CONTROL ACT OF 1997",
    "text": "Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of H.R. 3, the Juvenile Crime Control Act of 1997. This highly focused bill deals with violent juvenile offenders on the Federal level. H.R. 3 addresses the issue of incarcerating violent juvenile offenders at the Federal level by lowering the age at which a judge may waive a violent juvenile offender into adult court; treats juvenile records the same as adult records; and increases accountability for juveniles adjudicated delinquent and their parents. The measure also encourages placing juveniles younger than 16 in suitable juvenile facility prior to disposition or sentencing. For juveniles 16 and older, it provides for their detention in a suitable place designated by the Attorney General. This by no means requires that juvenile offenders on the Federal level be housed with adults. In addition, H.R. 3 provides that every juvenile detained prior to disposition or sentencing shall be provided with reasonable safety and security.H.R. 3 provides incentives for States to emulate this new approach. The grant program in H.R. 3 would be authorized at $500 million for 3 years. States must meet certain requirements if they are to obtain money from grants authorized by H.R. 3--e.g., they must try violent juvenile felons as young as 15 as adults; they must treat juvenile records like adult records; and they must permit parent-accountability orders. States which meet all the criteria could use the money for various initiatives such as establishing and maintaining accountability-based programs that work with juvenile offenders who are referred by law enforcement agencies, or which are designed in cooperation with law enforcement officials, to protect students and school personnel from drugs, gangs, and youth violence.Although I support H.R. 3, I realize it does not address the issue of nonviolent offenders on the State and Federal level, nor does it provide prevention and rehabilitation programs for juvenile offenders. These issues should be addressed when Congress reauthorizes the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. That is the appropriate time and the correct venue to aid our communities in developing programs to help youth stay away from crime, gangs, drugs and guns. Juvenile justice officials in Hawaii have asked for help in funding prevention programs, substance abuse programs, support programs for children who have little or no family life, and programs that would give State court judges an alternative program to deal with certain juvenile offenders instead of sending them to correctional facilities. I am sure my colleagues have heard similar requests from juvenile justice officials in their districts.Sending children to jail and throwing away the key while ignoring prevention and rehabilitation programs will not effectively reduce juvenile crime or be cost-effective. A 1996 study by the RAND Corp. found that early intervention and prevention programs are, indeed, cost-effective solutions for reducing the juvenile crime rate. The study indicates that prevention programs which focus on early intervention in the lives of children who are at greatest risk of eventual delinquent behavior are effective in reducing arrest and rearrest rates.We need to send a message to juveniles: If you commit a violent offense you will be punished accordingly. However, at the same time we must continue our attempt to reach kids, to get them involved in their communities, and to prevent them from taking part in dangerous activities in the first place. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3 and to strongly support a debate occurring this year on reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974.",

    "title": "DEDICATION OF ETERNITY HALL",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is a matter of some coincidence that today is Humanities on the Hill Day, and we had an opportunity, many of us, to meet with the representatives of the Endowment for the Humanities in our local jurisdictions from all over the country.In that context, I had the privilege of addressing the group who came here this morning for a few minutes, and had a chance to comment to them about a recent event in Hawaii at Schofield Barracks where I had the opportunity to deliver remarks at the dedication of Eternity Hall, Eternity Hall in Quadrangle D at Schofield Barracks. That occasion was on April 2, 1997.Tomorrow, Mr. Speaker, marks the 20th anniversary of the death of James Jones, the author of ``From Here to Eternity.'' I would like to take this opportunity, then, today to deliver yet again the comments that were made on that occasion, to indicate to my colleagues that tomorrow the film ``From Here to Eternity'' will be shown at Schofield Barracks, because the young soldiers that are there have taken a renewed interest in their history, have taken a renewed interest in Schofield Barracks and in World War II and, by extension, the author who made it possible for us to understand more about ourselves as a result of the great art that is ``From Here to Eternity.''Mr. Speaker, ``From Here to Eternity,'' like all great works of art, transcends its form. In this instance, the novel. Like all great works of art, it transforms those who experience it, its readers. It transposes its content, the characters and their actions, into a larger vision of life itself, a dimension of depth beyond the story itself.Schofield Barracks is the stage upon which the story unfolds. But it is not events of which we learn. Rather, we learn the meaning of integrity, honesty, honor, and above all, what it takes to be human. This is what it meant to me. ``From Here to Eternity'' shaped the basic values I hold to this day.So it was with a sense of outrage that I read a sneering, wounding article about James Jones just before leaving for Europe in 1967 on a backpack trek around the world. I had no idea I would literally walk into him in Paris some weeks later.I knew it was him the moment I saw this short, square block of a man plowing down the avenue. In my mind's eye now I see a cigar clamped in his clenched jaw, but perhaps it is only because I like to believe it was there. All I really saw were his eyes. How could such gentle eyes be locked into such a rugged mug of a face?To his friend William Styron, and I quote, ``was there ever such a face, with its Beethovenesque brow and lantern jaw and stepped-upon-looking nose. A forbidding face until one realized that it only seemed to glower, since the eyes really projected a skeptical humor that softened the initial impression of rage.''On impulse, I spoke to him.``Don't pay any attention to the critics. You write for us, for me. We're the readers. Pruitt, Warden, Maggio, they're real for us. ``From Here to Eternity'' means everything for us. What you write is important to us. To hell with the critics. Keep writing for us.'' Or some such blither.I felt a total fool. He stared at me, and I bolted away. A few days later I found myself outside his home on the Ile St. Louis behind Notre Dame. The San Francisco Diggers who fed the homeless during those years had published a directory of Americans worldwide who could be counted on to be kind to American travelers in need. I had come upon it in a Left Bank book store, and Jones's name and address were in it.I rang the bell on impulse out of both a desire to apologize and yet tell him again more clearly how much he meant to us as readers. A suspicious housekeeper somehow agreed to tell him that the man who stopped him on the Right Bank the other day wanted to see him.Amazingly she returned animated. By all means Mr. Jones would see me. He was anxious to see me. Please come up. Would it be possible to wait a few minutes while he finished his writing for the day. Please don't leave.I was a bit dazed as I sat on a stool on what appeared to be a tiny bar and library area. Suddenly he burst through a door, barrel-chested, huge smile, moving like a pulling guard on a halfback sweep.``Am I glad to see you. I told Gloria,'' his wife Gloria, ``I told Gloria all about our meeting. I've been writing on the energy of it for the past two weeks. I never seem to meet readers any more. It's always somebody who wants something from me. How about a drink?''From that moment, I ceased to be a fan. I became a fierce partisan. I had never met anyone so nakedly honest in his observations and inquiries, so plain-spokenly straight. No rhetorical brilliance, just easy-fit words and thoughts expressed as solid and simple as a beating heart, just like From Here to Eternity.In 1951, the Los Angeles Times said:James Jones has written a tremendously compelling and compassionate story. The scope covers the full range of the human condition, man's fate and man's hope. It is a tribute to human dignity.The book was From Here to Eternity. Its author was 30 years old. In March of 1942, he had written to his brother Jeff from his bunk at Schofield Barracks.Sometimes the air is awfully clear here. You can look off to sea and see the soft, warm, raggedy roof of clouds stretching on and on and on. It almost seems as if you can look right on into eternity.It is 20 years tomorrow since James Jones died, leaving his work to speak for him and to us.Biographer George Garret said,Boy and man, Jones never lost his energetic interest, his continual curiosity, the freshness of his vision. It was these qualities, coupled with the rigor of his integrity, which defined the character of his life's work.Others, of course, recognize these qualities and wish to speak for and about James Jones on this anniversary of his passing.Winston Groom, George Hendrick, Norman Mailer, William Styron, whose Forward to To Reach Eternity: The letters of James Jones, I include here in its totality and from which I will read, Mr. Speaker, excerpts, and Willie Morris, friend and biographer of his last days, all are represented in the remarks which follow.First is a letter to me from Winston Groom:Dear Congressman Abercrombie: Gloria Jones asked me to write to you regarding the dedication of a building in Schofield Barracks in honor of her late husband, James Jones. This is a wonderful and fitting tribute to a fine soldier and a great writer who contributed perhaps more than any other to the public understanding of the military during the World War II era. Long before I wrote Forrest Gump I began a friendship with Jim Jones which was cut far too short by his untimely death. He was always kind and giving to the younger generation of writers and took time to help me with my first novel, Better Times Than These, which was about the Vietnam War. In fact, I dedicated that book to Jim. I congratulate you and all the others who worked to create this very appropriate memorial to a great American patriot and champion of the common soldier. Respectfully yours, Winston Groom.I received a letter from George Hendrick, a professor of English at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.Dear Neil: I'm sending along, as promised, the statement for the Schofield Barracks ceremony. I am certainly pleased to know about this important event and to play some small part in it. The university library has acquired the manuscript of From Here To Eternity and The Pistol, and they will be on exhibit at the next meeting of the James Jones Literary Society in Springfield on November 4 of this year. I hope you can attend.Professor Hendrick's comments are as follows:Pvt. James Jones, then a member of the air corps, transferred to the 27th Infantry Regiment at Schofield Barracks in September of 1940. Jones, not yet 19 years old, was already an aspiring novelist, and he was later to have a clear recollection of life in F Company in Quad D, of the lives of officers and enlisted men, and of the landscape around Schofield. In From Here to Eternity he made this peacetime army uniquely his own. When Jones was finishing Eternity in 1949 he wrote a chapter about the events of December 7, 1941, at Pearl Harbor, with emphasis on the strafing of Schofield Barracks that day. He wrote his editor about the chapter.And I quote:Here is the piece de resistance, the tour de force, the final accolade and calumnity, the climax, peak, and focus. Here, in a word, is Pearl Harbor . . . I personally believe it will stack up with Stendhal's Waterloo or Tolstoy's Austerlitz. That is what I was aiming at, and wanted it to do, and I think it does it. I don't think it does, send it back, and I'll rewrite it. Good isn't enough, not for me, any way; good is only middling fair. We must remember people will be reading this book a couple of hundred years after I'm dead . . . The chapter did not need rewriting. In fact, his intent throughout the novel had been to aim high and capture for all time the complex world of Schofield Barracks as it was in 1940 and 1941. From Here To Eternity is now a classic American novel, and Schofield Barracks is preserved in it as if in amber.Norman Mailer, along with William Styron and James Jones, the great trio of writers to come out of World War II said, and I quote:The only one of my contemporaries who I felt had more talent than myself was James Jones, and he has also been the one writer of my time for whom I felt any love. We saw each other only six or eight times over the years, but it always gave me a boost to know that Jim was in town. He carried his charge with him, he had the talent to turn a night of heavy drinking into a great time. I felt then and can still say now that From Here To Eternity has been the best American novel since of the Second World War, and if it is ridden with faults, and ignorances, and a smudge of the sentimental, it has the force that few novels one could name. What was unique about Jones was that he had come out of nowhere, self-taught, a clunk in his lacks, but the only one of us who had the guts of a broken-glass brawl.William Styron faxed to me his introduction to the volume of Jim Jones's letters. He asked that certain passages, those which he thought were most effective for illuminating James Jones, be read at the ceremony. He invited me to feel free to use any part of the essay, not just the circled passages, and I think that I have the essence of it here from William Styron:From Here To Eternity was published at a time when I was in the process of completing my own first novel. I remember reading Eternity when I was living and writing in a country house in Rockland County, not far from New York City, and as has so often been the case with books that have made a large impression on me, I can recall the actual reading, the mood, the excitement, the surroundings. I remember the couch I lay on while reading, the room, the wallpaper, white curtains stirring and flowing in an indolent breeze, and cars that passed on the road outside. I think that perhaps I read portions of the book in other parts of the house, but it is that couch what I chiefly recollect, and myself sprawled on it, holding the hefty volume aloft in front of my eyes as I remained more or less transfixed through most of the waking hours of several days enthralled, to the story's power, its immediate narrative authority, its vigorously peopled barracks and barrooms its gutsy humor and its immense harrowing sadness.The book was about the unknown world of the peace time army. Even if I had not suffered some of the outrages of military life, I am sure I would have recognized the book's stunning authenticity, its burly artistry, its sheer richness as life. A sense of permanence attached itself to the pages. This remarkable quality did not arise from Jones's language, for it was quickly apparent that the author was not a stylist, certainly not the stylist of refinement and nuance that former students of creative writing classes had been led to emulate.The genial rhythms and carefully wrought sentences that English majors had been encouraged to admire were not on display in Eternity, nor was the writing even vaguely experimental; it was so conventional as to be premodern. This was doubtless a blessing, for here was a writer whose urgent, blunt language with its off-key tonalities and hulking emphasis on adverbs wholly matched his subject matter. Jones's wretched outcasts and the narrative voice he had summoned to tell their tale had achieved a near-perfect synthesis. What also made the book a triumph were the characters Jones had fashioned--Prewitt, Warden, Maggio, the officers and their wives, the Honolulu whores, the brig rats, and all the rest. There were none of the wan, tentative effigies that had begun to populate the pages of postwar fiction during its brief span, but human beings of real size and arresting presence, believable and hard to forget. The language may have been coarse-grained but it had Dreiserian force, and the people were as alive as those of Dostoevski.It has been said that writers are fiercely jealous of one another. Kurt Vonnegut has observed that most writers display towards one another the edgy mistrust of bears. This may be true, but I do recall that in those years directly following World War II, there seemed to be a moratorium on envy, and most of the young writers who were heirs to the Lost Generation developed, for a time at least, a camaraderie, or a reasonable compatibility, as if there were glory enough to go all around for all the novelists about to try to fit themselves into the niches alongside those of the earlier masters.When I finished reading From Here to Eternity, I felt no jealousy at all, only a desire to meet this man just four years older than myself, who had inflicted on me such emotional turmoil in the act of telling me authentic truths about an underside of American life I barely knew existed. I wanted to talk to the writer who had dealt so eloquently with those lumpen warriors and who had created scenes that tore at the guts. Jim was serious about fiction in a way that now seems a little old-fashioned and ingenuous, with the novel for him in magisterial reign. He saw it as sacred mission, as icon, as Grail. Like so many American writers of distinction, Jim had not been granted the benison of a formal education, but like these dropouts he had done a vast amount of impassioned and eclectic reading; thus while there were gaps in his literary background that college boys like me had filled, he had absorbed an impressive amount of writing for a man whose schoolhouse had been at home or in a barracks. He had been, and still was, a hungry reader, and it was fascinating in those dawn sessions with him to hear this fellow built like a welterweight boxer, speak in his gravelly drill sergeant's voice about a few of his more recherche loves. Virginia Woolf was one, I recall; Edith Wharton another. I did not agree with Jim much of the time, but I usually found that his tastes and judgments were, on their own terms, gracefully discriminating and astute.Basically it had to do with men at war, for Jim had been to war, he had been wounded on Guadalcanal, had seen men die, had been sickened and traumatized by the experience. Hemmingway had been to war too, and had been wounded, but despite the gloss of misery and disenchantment that overlaid his work, Jim maintained he was at heart a war lover, a macho contriver of romantic effects, and to all but the gullible and wishful, the lie showed glaringly through the fabric of his books and in his life.He therefore had committed the artist's chief sin by betraying the truth. Jim's opinions of Hemingway, justifiable in its harshness or not, was less significant than what it revealed about his own view of existence, which at its most penetrating, as in From Here to Eternity and later in The Pistol and The Thin Red Line, was always seen through the soldier's eye, in a hallucination where the circumstances of military life cause men to behave mostly like beasts and where human dignity, while welcome and often redemptive, is not the general rule.Jones was among the best anatomists of warfare in our time, and in his bleak, extremely professional vision he continued to insist that war was a congenital and chronic illness from which we would never be fully delivered. War rarely ennobled men and usually degraded them. Cowardice and heroism were both celluloid figments, generally interchangeable, and such grandeur as could be salvaged from the mess lay at best in pathos, in the haplessness of men's mental and physical suffering.Living or dying in war had nothing to do with valor, it had to do with luck. Jim had endured very nearly the worst. He had seen death face to face. At least partially as a result of this, he was quite secure in his masculinity and better able than anyone else I have known to detect muscle-bound pretense and empty bravado. It is fortunate that he did not live to witness Rambo or our high-level infatuation with military violence. It would have brought out the assassin in him.The next major work of war was The Thin Red Line, a novel of major dimensions whose rigorous integrity and disciplined art allowed Jim once again to exploit the military world he knew so well. Telling the story of GIs in combat in the Pacific, it is squarely in the gritty, no-holds-barred tradition of American realism, a genre that even in 1962, when the book was published, would have seemed oafishly out of date had it not been for Jim's mastery of the narrative and his grasp of sun-baked milieu of bloody island warfare, which exerted such a compelling hold on the reader that he seemed to breathe new life into the form.Romain Gary had commented about the book: ``It is essentially a love poem about the human predicament and like all great books it leaves one with a feeling of wonder and hope.'' The rhapsodic note is really not all that overblown.Upon rereading, The Thin Red Line stands up remarkably well, one of the best novels written about American fighting men in combat. The Thin Red Line is a brilliant example of what happens when a novelist summons strength from the deepest wellsprings of his inspiration. In this book, along with From Here to Eternity and Whistle, a work of many powerful scenes that suffered from the fact that he was dying as he tried unsuccessfully to finish it, Jim obeyed his better instincts by attending to that forlorn figure whom in all the world he had cared for most and understood better than any other writer alive, the common foot soldier, the grungy enlisted man.His friend at the end, Willie Morris, wrote these words:Dear Congressman Abercrombie, I hope this is what you had in mind. My friend Jim Jones was sent to Schofield Barracks at the age of 18 in 1939 as a private in the old Hawaii Division, which later became the 25th Tropical Lightning Infantry Division. He was a member of Company F. It would be the division of the memorable characters in Jones's classic novel From Here to Eternity: Prewitt and Maggio and Warden and Chief Choate and Stark and Captain Dynamite Holmes and the others, and it would go through Guadalcanal and New Georgia and the liberation of the Philippines all the way to the occupation of mainland Japan, although Jim's own fighting days would end when he was wounded at Guadalcanal. Schofield Barracks resonates with the memory of James Jones and the imperishable characters and events he placed here in his fiction, the sounds of the drills, the echoes of Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt's Taps across the quadrangle, the Japanese planes swooping over the barracks of the fateful morning of December 7, 1941. On the morning of December 7, after the attack started, Jim went to the guard orderly desk outside the colonel's office of the old 27th Regiment quadrangle to carry messages for distraught officers, wearing an issue pistol he was later able to make off with as his fictional Private Mast did in The Pistol. In mid-afternoon of that day his company, along with hundreds of others, pulled out of Schofield for their defensive beach positions. As they passed Pearl Harbor, they could see the rising columns of smoke for miles around. Jones wrote: ``I shall never forget the sight as we passed over the lip of the central plateau and began the long drop down to Pearl City. Down toward the towering smoke columns as far as the eye could see, the long line of Army trucks would serpentine up and down the draws of red dirt through the green of cane and pineapple. Machine guns were mounted on the cab roofs of every truck possible. I remember thinking with the sense of the profoundest awe that none of our lives would ever be the same, that a social, even a cultural watershed had been crossed which we could never go back over, and I wondered how many of us would survive to see the end results. I wondered if I would. I had just turned 20 the month before.'' It is fitting that Eternity Hall be dedicated to James Jones. He was one of the greatest writers of World War II. Many consider him the foremost one. His spirits will dwell forever on these grounds.On my last night in Paris heading for Africa and beyond, I left Jim and Gloria vowing someday somehow would I see From Here to Eternity and Jim honored at Schofield Barracks.James Jones had said to his brother in 1942,I would like to leave books behind me to let people know what I have lived. I'd like to think that people would read them avidly, as I have read so many, and would feel the sadness and frustration and joy and love I tried to put in them, that people would think about that guy James Jones and wish they had known the guy that could write like that.They know you at Schofield Barracks, Jim, today, in Eternity Hall. The ghosts of all those who came before to this quadrangle and the shades of all those who will come, know you and they know you love them.As he neared death, he struggled to finish Whistle, to complete what he had begun with Eternity. The final scene of the novel became the ultimate expression of his passion. Facing the end, he wrote of ``taking into himself all the pain and anguish and sorrow and misery that is the lot of all soldiers, taking it into himself and into the universe as well.''The universe for James Jones in From Here to Eternity began and ended at Schofield Barracks. The measure of this universe and the final judgment of and about James Jones is to be found in the simple declaration of his dedication:To the United States Army. I have eaten your bread and salt. I have drunk your water and wine. The deaths ye died I have watched beside, and the lives ye led were mine. From Rudyard Kipling.``I write,'' Jim said, ``to reach eternity.'' You made it, Jim. Today in Eternity Hall, in Quadrangle D, in Schofield Barracks, you made it. Welcome home, Jim.",

The issue of bycatch should be addressed in this fishery and every other fishery with a strong bycatch reduction requirement. The gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Gilcrest], I am happy to say, was willing to accept the amendment. The gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] was willing to cooperate.However, word came down to the committee that the State Department was firmly opposed to any changes in the legislation. The State Department does not want to accept the amendment, did not want to accept our amendment, because it would strengthen the commitment by including specific bycatch reduction.Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 408, the International Dolphin Program Act. With all due respect to my good friends from Maryland, Mr. Gilchrest, and from New Jersey, Mr. Saxton, this bill is not about protecting dolphins. This bill is about the U.S. Department of State arbitrarily dictating changes in U.S. law without consulting Congress until after the deed is done.In 1990, Mexico and Venezuela filed a formal complaint with GATT after the Mexican tuna was embargoed for not achieving comparability with the United States tuna fleet. The GATT panel ruled that the United States had no right to use trade restrictions on a product based on the way the product was made or harvested. This finding has broad implications for a variety of U.S. consumer protection, health and safety, and environmental laws. However it is important to point out that the panel did not address the dolphin-safe label itself.Since the ruling, Mexico has been pressuring the United States to change its dolphin protection law so that they can sell their tuna in the United States. No one knew until 1995 that the State Department and Mexico were negotiating a deal which is now known as the Panama Declaration. This agreement requires major changes to U.S. law. The State Department did not consult with Congress during the entire process, and now this agreement is being rammed through Congress.By codifying the Panama Declaration, H.R. 408, eliminates the embargo provision in the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which is based on the rate of dolphin kill. The bill allows tuna caught by nations which are members of the Inter American Tropical Tuna Commission [IATTC] to enter the U.S. market if the total mortality for all nations remains below 5,000 annually and allow some tuna caught by the IATTC nations to be labeled ``dolphin safe.'' This dolphin mortality level is double the amount of the 1996 dolphin mortality level for Mexico and other nations fishing in the eastern Pacific. There is no reason why the acceptable dolphin kill level should be set at 5,000, thus allowing IATTC nations a higher dolphin mortality for dolphin safe tuna sold in the United States.The measure also narrows the definition of ``dolphin safe'' so that the only excludable tuna would be that which involved the killing of no dolphins during the fishing operation. It would, however, allow unlimited harassment of dolphins. Mexico and other nations want this provision so that their tuna will be bought by unsuspecting Americans who trust that the tuna was caught without harassing dolphins. Mexico and other nations know the American consumer will not tolerate the slaughter of dolphins. This is why the U.S. tuna canning industry adopted the dolphin-safe label in the first place. Without a dolphin-safe label on tuna, consumers will not buy it. We should not change the definition without scientific evidence.Supporters of H.R. 408 claim that scientific information supports the legislation. This is not accurate. The National Marine Fisheries Service [NMFS] conducted a study of tuna by-catch in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean from dolphin, schoolfish, and log sets from 1989 to 1992. A pattern emerged showing that by-catch was generally low or nonexistent in dolphin sets, low to moderate in school sets and high to very high in log sets. There is no doubt that a fishing method using the chase and netting of dolphins results in a lower by-catch of other species, such as sea turtles and sharks. While the by-catch issue has merit and deserves attention, the Panama Agreement does not resolve the problem. Other nondolphin methods of fishing for tuna are not being considered.More importantly, scientists have no evidence that the impacts of high speed chase and netting are not harmful to dolphins or dolphin populations. Some dolphin populations are chased more than once a day, with more than 3 million animals chased every year. Information from the NMFS biologists studying these populations indicates that they are currently stable at about one-fifth of their original size. NMFS' own scientists and the IATTC have reported that these stocks show no signs of recovery. We have no idea if the dolphin-set method impacts the dolphin fecundity or mortality.During committee markup I offered an amendment on bycatch reduction. The issue of bycatch should be addressed in this fishery and every other fishery with strong bycatch reduction requirements. Mr. Gilchrest was willing to accept the amendment. However, word came down to the committee that the State Department was firmly opposed to any changes in the legislation. The State Department didn't want to accept the amendment, because it would strengthen the commitment by including specific bycatch reduction program. What really troubles me is that the State Department did not base their position on the bycatch reduction program on science or the environment. Instead, the State Department's sole concern was political expediency.The State Department told Congress that H.R. 408 is unamendable. They have rejected any attempts at compromise. Congress should not acquiesce to a precedent that lowers our environmental laws, consumer protection, and health and safety laws just because another nation desires to sell its products in America. If the goal of H.R. 408 is to increase trade and open our markets to Mexico, the State Department should come clean. They should not hide behind a veil of environmentalism.Let's vote to protect dolphins and the environment, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 408.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 1420. This compromise clearly establishes the conservation mission of the National Wildlife Refuge System while ensuring the compatible wildlife-dependent recreation continues to have a place within the system as well. It requires that all uses of the system meet the same objective tests of compatibility.If and when hunting, bird watching, or other forms of wildlife-dependent recreation are found compatible with wildlife conservation, they are given priority treatment over nonwildlife-dependent uses of the system. This is a sound policy that ensures conservation is paramount, while providing maximum opportunities for compatible wildlife-dependent recreation for the public. Our job here is to provide a good blueprint for managing the refuge system and let the wildlife management professional take it from there. This bill does that. We should pass it and let the professional get back to work.Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1420 is a good example of bipartisanship, perhaps more appropriately, nonpartisanship. I want to commend Secretary Babbitt, the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young], the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton], the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller], the ranking member, and the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Dingell], who is here, as mentioned by the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young], and the various interest groups for all their hard work in crafting legislation that satisfies a diversity of needs while preserving a fundamental mission of the system.Mr. Speaker, I might say that that lineup of people that I just enumerated is a living example of diversity of needs while preserving the fundamental mission of the House of Representatives.Perhaps we can apply the same approach to address the backlog of management needs plaguing our wildlife refuges. If the refuge system had adequate resources, the various user groups might not be fighting each other so much over access and management decisions. The House's adoption of this legislation today is a significant step forward in recognizing the importance of wildlife refuges and addressing their problems.I urge, as the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young] did, all of our colleagues to support the bill.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume and I rise in strong support of the bill.However, I would like to add that, hopefully, the funding for Sea Grant, the funding numbers for the Sea Grant proposal here, are more accurate than those recently assigned to the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Sensenbrenner]. This represents a compromise, Mr. Chairman. Perhaps those numbers the gentleman from Wisconsin had assigned to him by the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] also represent a compromise.But this represents a compromise, Mr. Chairman, between the Committee on Resources and the Committee on Science, which shares jurisdiction with the Committee on Resources over the research component of Sea Grant.The bill reauthorizes the National Sea Grant College Program, which for over 30 years has addressed important local, regional, and national marine resource management problems through education, research, and public outreach.The compromise text, Mr. Chairman, reauthorizes Sea Grant for 3 years. It clarifies the roles of the national office and the Sea Grant colleges. It strengthens competitive peer review, as the gentleman from New Jersey mentioned, particularly for grants and contracts for research, education and outreach, and generally brings Sea Grant up to date as a modern education and research program.The authorization levels in the bill will force some belt-tightening at the national Sea Grant office but will provide for modest growth in funding for programs and projects carried out by the Sea Grant colleges themselves. These activities are the heart and soul of the Sea Grant Program and are parts of the program that must be preserved, especially in difficult budget times.Since 1968, speaking from personal experience, Mr. Chairman, the University of Hawaii's Sea Grant College Program has been a useful resource in the areas of aquaculture, marine biotechnology, coastal processes, coastal pollution and reef ecology. In the State of Hawaii marine resources are vital. Hawaii's coastal resources, which are world-renowned tourist attractions, generate nearly 40 percent of our gross State product. The value of our coastal resources is dependent on their health and beauty.I want to express my appreciation for the cooperation the minority has received from the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] and the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young] and their staffs. H.R. 437 is not really a bipartisan bill, Mr. Chairman, it is a nonpartisan bill. I think all of us who represent coastal areas have long appreciated the benefits of this practical, noncontroversial program.We would have been on the floor nearly 2 years ago reauthorizing this popular and pragmatic program if ideology had not interfered. On that note, I appreciate the cooperation extended by the leadership of the Committee on Science in the person of the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Sensenbrenner] and his staff in working out this compromise. Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate the work, in addition, of my good friend, whom I had the pleasure of working with in a previous committee, the Minerals Subcommittee, the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert].I hope this new spirit of cooperation leads to more timely authorization of marine research and oceanography programs, which are so vital not only to this Nation but to the planet, Mr. Chairman, over which the two committees share jurisdiction. This is a good start on a very good bill reauthorizing a popular program. I urge the House and all of our colleagues to support this legislation.Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "title": "VETERANS' CEMETERY PROTECTION ACT OF 1997",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, before I make my remarks, I would like to extend my gratitude to the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert]. I have had the pleasure of working with him in the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources of the Committee on Resources where he was the chair and I was the ranking member on that committee. We got to know each other very well, able to understand our problems and work to solve them in a mutual fashion. It turns out by sad coincidence that we had a mutual interest in the Veterans' Cemetery Protection Act.Mr. Speaker, I will relate to Members in the course of my remarks the circumstances that took place at Punchbowl and elsewhere out in the Hawaiian Islands with respect to the desecration of our cemeteries there. It was with an equal degree of sadness that I learned that the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] had experienced similar problems and difficulties in Riverside and we found out that this was in fact a nationwide problem. With his usual regard for acting quickly on matters, the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] and I were able to put together this bill and receive the kind and prompt attention of the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde] in the Committee on the Judiciary. I am sure I am speaking for the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] and myself in expressing not only our personal regard to the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde], but with respect to this particular legislation, the promptness with which the gentleman and his staff dealt with this particular bill is something to be admired and we are very, very grateful to him.I want to thank the gentleman from Florida [Mr. McCollum] as well for making a significant contribution in improving the bill. I am sure that the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] agrees with me that the amendments that were put in during committee have been very, very beneficial to the bill.I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Stump] for his interest right from the very, very beginning, obviously with his background and experience in the Committee on Veterans' Affairs; nonetheless, his approval of and support for the bill has been very valuable in moving it forward to this point. I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Frank] for his interest in the bill.Obviously, Mr. Speaker, my colleagues can tell from the list of individuals that I have spoken about today that this is a nonpartisan bill. It has nothing to do with political parties; it has everything to do with our regard for the United States of America and the symbolic importance of what is involved in the Veterans' Cemetery Protection Act.Mr. Speaker, today then I rise to voice my strong support for H.R. 1532, the Veterans' Cemetery Protection Act of 1997 which I am introducing, as I indicated, along with my colleague from California [Mr. Calvert]. This bill instructs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to significantly increase the criminal penalties for theft and wilful vandalism at national cemeteries. The penalties under this bill are clear and would send an unmistakable message to those who chose to desecrate the final resting place of our veterans.In a national cemetery anyone convicted of vandalism that causes a damage of less than $1,000 can be fined and serve a maximum prison term of 1 year. Anyone convicted of vandalism that exceeds $1,000 can receive penalties of a maximum 10-year prison term and a fine. In addition, anyone convicted of hiding, stealing or selling national cemetery property could be sentenced to a maximum 15-year prison term and corresponding fine.Mr. Speaker, I know for some Members this may be almost the first time they are hearing this kind of discussion. It may sound to them almost impossible that anyone would be hiding, stealing or selling national cemetery property, but unfortunately this is a fact of contemporary life. The time to act on this legislation therefore is now. How many more times do we want to open the newspaper, listen to a radio account, or watch the evening news and learn of another act of shocking desecration occurring at one of our national cemeteries?Let me recount the most recent examples for my colleagues. In 1994, a grave was opened at Ball's Bluff National Cemetery, and the remains of the soldier were scattered about presumably by a relic hunter.In 1996, Riverside National Cemetery, as the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] indicated, the second largest national cemetery in the Nation, was vandalized by a person or persons who stole engraved bronze markers from 128 graves. A few months before, thieves stole over 500 markers from a storage facility at the cemetery. They attempted to sell the markers to a recycling plant for financial gain.Finally, the most recent act of wilful vandalism, which occurred in Hawaii and New Jersey. On April 19, 1997 seven Oahu cemeteries, including the Hawaii Veterans' Cemetery in Kaneohe and the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific at Punchbowl were vandalized. Racist and profane words were spray-painted on grave markers, cemetery walls and even on the chapel of the National Memorial Cemetery. These acts were an insult to the people buried there, their families and the entire Hawaii community. I feel deeply for the relatives who are still experiencing the pain caused by this outrage.Mr. Speaker, I can scarcely get across today in words the anguish that people felt when viewing the circumstances of the vandalism at Punchbowl and elsewhere. What still gives one faith in the human spirit to triumph over tragedy is the pure unselfishness of the State and local government, veterans groups and community individuals who stepped up to the task of repairing the damage. Currently the estimated costs of repairing and cleaning up these cemeteries is between $20,000 and $25,000.Almost immediately Governor Benjamin Cayetano pledged to mobilize veterans, active duty U.S. military, the Hawaii National Guard and youth groups like the Hawaii Youth Challenge. He asked Maj. Gen. Edward Richardson, the State Adjutant General, and Walter Ozawa, Veterans Services Director, to work with Adm. Joseph Prueher, the Pacific Commander in Chief, to enlist help in the joint cleanup effort.The human spirit was renewed by the efforts of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, whose president, Ken Huber, called the desecration of the national cemetery an unconscionable act and affront to all the men and women in the Armed Services. The Paralyzed Veterans notified Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown that on behalf of the PVA members and in recognition of the sacrifices of all veterans the PVA would cover the cost of repairing and restoring the national cemetery. Other local Hawaii veterans groups posted reward moneys for information leading to the apprehension and conviction of these vandals.The spirit was further renewed by the actions of individuals, more than 700 of whom signed up to help at Punchbowl Cemetery. Because of the expertise and harmful chemicals required for most of the cleanup, only a handful could be used at any one time. But that did not stop Vi DeCaires from working to clean a grave, scrubbing the granite marker with a toothbrush. She said the people buried here have given so much to us. I just wanted to give back.Dorothy Tamashiro volunteered because her husband Harold is buried at Punchbowl. He was a member of the World War II 100th Infantry Battalion. According to Dorothy, ``when I saw the news I started to cry. So when the phone number came up on the screen I volunteered.''Then there was Lilla LeVine, who worked to clean the grave of Army Sgt. Maj. Earl R. Davidson, a veteran of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. ``How sad to think he did all this and this would happen to him,'' she said. ``He is a person, not just a stone.'' ``He is a person, not just a stone. He had a life and a family and he fought for his country through three wars. I hope he knows we are taking care of this as much as we can.''And most recently, on May 18, vandalism estimated at $10,000 darkened the sky of the 133-year-old Beverly, New Jersey National Cemetery where Veterans of Foreign War posts from throughout the State have come together on each Memorial Day for 52 years. Vandals tore down flagpoles, pulled memorial benches from their cement foundations and ruined the entrance garden. Here again veterans groups have posted reward moneys for information leading to the apprehension of the vandals as well as money to repair the damages to the cemetery.I am pleased to inform my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that because of the efforts of a number of individuals and groups, the last of the hate messages and graffiti was removed just prior to Memorial Day at Punchbowl with the help of the $21,000 donated thus far to the cleanup. Vandals can never ``tarnish what our heroes have left us,'' Honolulu Mayor Jeremy Harris said during the Memorial Day ceremony.Today we are responding to the call to keep our heroes untarnished with the introduction of this act. Our Constitution provides many freedoms and rights. It does not provide us the right to physically destroy what is not ours, even if it is to send a message. With rights come responsibilities, and it is our responsibility today as Members of Congress to ensure the right to be laid to rest in hallowed ground, like those men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation, is not compromised or profaned.",

    "title": "JUVENILE CRIME CONTROL AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION ACT OF 1997",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 1818, the Juvenile Crime Control and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1997. Earlier this year, the House considered and passed H.R. 3, the Juvenile Crime Control Act of 1997, which is directed at increasing the Federal penalties for violent juvenile crime. H.R. 1818 provides a complement to H.R. 3. It provides the prevention component of a comprehensive approach to addressing juvenile crime. This bill proves that both sides can work together and craft a balanced approach to juvenile crime. I am proud to be a cosponsor of it.H.R. 1818 makes a number of changes to current law to increase the flexibility of States to treat status offenders in the most appropriate manner. For example, it retains the four core requirements of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 and slightly modifies three of them. The core requirement mandating States to reduce the disproportionate number of minorities confined in secure facilities was strengthened and clarified. H.R. 1818 requires States to reduce disproportionate minority confinement by addressing both delinquency prevention efforts and system improvement efforts. However, it prohibits the establishment of numerical standards or quotas. The measure tries to ensure that prevention efforts are targeted to communities where a disproportionate number of minorities are committed to the juvenile justice system. H.R. 1818 also altered the sight and sound separation requirement to prohibit regular contact, but allow for supervised, incidental contact such as passing in a hallway. This does not mean that Congress is reducing its focus on this important core requirement.Last, the core requirement that prohibits the housing of juveniles in adult facilities was modified to build additional flexibility into the law by extending the period of time for which juveniles can be held in a facility with adults, prior to an initial court appearance, to 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays. States must still enforce the sight and sound separation requirement. In addition, it allows juveniles to be held for longer periods of time in facilities with adults in rural areas as long as there is no existing acceptable alternative placement, the parent or legal guardian of the juvenile involved consents, and it is approved in advance by the court. Such placement is, however, required to be reviewed periodically, at intervals of not more than 5 days for the duration of the detention or confinement to ensure it is the appropriate placement for such youth. Also, courts are urged to use this exception carefully.Compliance with the four core requirements is still Congress' goal. H.R. 1818 tries to make it easier for States to comply with the core requirements by allowing States to receive 50 percent of the formula money and the other 50 percent depending on their compliance with the four requirements. Under current law, if a State is not in compliance with the four requirements, then it loses all of the formula money.In addition, H.R. 1818 consolidates current discretionary programs into a flexible block grant program entitled the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant Program. In order for a State to receive any money under the prevention block grant, States must participate in the formula grant program and agree to use 95 percent of the funds they receive to fund local projects. H.R. 1818 also requires States to develop a plan to reduce and prevent juvenile crime with the assistance of community-based organizations and organizations in the local juvenile justice system which carry out programs, projects, or activities to prevent juvenile delinquency.The block grants will be allocated in the following manner: 50 percent on the basis of how many people in the State are under the age of 18, and the other 50 percent on the annual average number of arrests for serious crimes committed in the eligible State by juveniles. The prevention block grant will help juvenile justice officials in Hawaii and in other States fund prevention programs, substance abuse programs, support programs for children who have little or no family life, and programs that would give State court judges an alternative program to deal with certain juvenile offenders instead of sending them to correctional facilities.Everyone here knows that the nature of juvenile crime has changed drastically over the years. We have only to look through the paper to see younger people committing more violent crimes. Today's youths need to understand that they will be punished accordingly for crimes committed. However, that is only half of the battle. It is our duty to reach to our children, to get them involved in their communities, and to prevent them from taking part in dangerous activities in the first place. H.R. 1818 is an important component in our fight to meet this new challenge. It will help States prevent, reduce, and control juvenile crime. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1818.",

Proper conservation and management of the Pacific salmon is more important to both the United States and Canada than confrontation.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I will support H.R. 2014, the Taxpayer Relief Act.Yet I cannot rise without sharing my greatest concern with the tax bill, the airline ticket tax. The changes proposed in the airline ticket tax will have an adverse effect on Hawaii's people and on our economy. The segment portion of the domestic ticket tax is unfair. It is particularly unfair to Hawaii where Aloha, Hawaiian, and Mahalo, our local inter-island carriers, provide short-haul trips between the islands. Our unique geography as an island chain makes air travel a necessity. Unlike other areas of the country, we do not have a choice. If individuals want to travel from island to island, we have to fly. In order to make it economical for our people, Aloha, Hawaiian, and Mahalo island hop. The domestic airline ticket tax shifts the burden to low-cost, short-haul carriers. These are our local carriers and this will hurt Hawaii.The ticket tax increase on international flights from $6 to $24 is another concern. Tourism is Hawaii's largest industry. It is a large industry for many States of the Union. International visitors are a vital part of our tourism industry.Mr. Speaker, I will not dwell any further on the ticket tax except to say that I will work with all my energy to repeal these provisions in the future as we proceed to a tax bill next year.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2014. The conference report we are voting on today is an improvement over the version that initially passed the House in June. I voted against that measure for a number of reasons: It denied the full benefits of the child deduction to hard-working, low-income taxpayers who avail themselves of the earned income tax credit; it opened up enormous loopholes that would have fully or partially excluded millions of American workers from the protection of labor laws and fundamental benefits like Social Security and worker compensation; and it short changed low and middle-income taxpayers, denying them a fair share of its tax cuts.The bill before us today remedies those deficiencies in whole or large measure.Yesterday, the House passed the spending bill that sets our Nation on a path to have a balanced budget by 2002. The bill we are voting on today provides tax relief for our citizens--tax relief that is paid for.We have arrived at this point because of the courageous vote taken in 1993. The 1993 budget agreement was a 5-year deficit reduction package. It was a fiscally sound decision. As a result of the deficit reduction package our Nation has a healthy economy.Unfortunately, my constituents in Hawaii have not benefited from the economic upswing to the same extent as the rest of the Nation. Hawaii needs an economic stimulus. The balanced budget tax relief agreement we are voting on today will help us. It is not a silver bullet, but it will benefit a great many hard-pressed people and small businesses in Hawaii.I am voting for this bill not because it is perfect, but because on the balance it helps working families and the middle class. It helps the people of Hawaii.The bill helps Hawaii families. It provides a child tax credit of $400 a child in 1998 and increases to $500 a child thereafter for children age 16 and under. The credit phases out for couples with adjusted gross incomes of $110,000 and individuals with incomes of $75,000.The bill helps Hawaii college students. It provides a tax credit of up to $1,500 a year for the first 2 years of college and a tax credit of up to $1,000 for later years. Eligibility phases out for couples with incomes between $80,000 and $100,000 and individuals with incomes of between $50,000 and $60,000.The bill helps Hawaii homeowners. Married couples may exclude up to $500,000--single individuals may exclude up to $250,000--of capital gains from the sale of a primary residence. In Hawaii, this provision will be particularly helpful to residents whose principal investment is their home.The bill provides Hawaii with broad based capital gains reduction. Capital gains come from the owning of assets such as stock, bonds, homes, real estate, and businesses. The top capital gains tax rate drops from 28 percent to 20 percent. This rate will drop further to 18 percent, effective in 2001, for individuals who hold assets for 5 years or longer. For married couples with incomes less than $41,200 the capital gains tax rate drops from 15 percent to 10 percent. The rate will drop further to 8 percent, effective in 2001, for married couples who currently earn less than $41,200 and who hold assets for 5 years or longer. The bill provides Hawaii with estate tax relief. The estate tax will increase from the current $600,000 to $1 million. It will be phased in over a 10-year period.The bill provides Hawaii with expanded IRA--Individual Retirement Account--opportunities. It creates new IRA Plus accounts. Contributions are not deductible, but interest, dividends, and capital gains accumulate tax free. Allows penalty free withdrawals for first time home purchases. Further, withdrawals are tax free if the account is held for at least 5 years and the account holder is at least 59\\1/2\\. Income limits on traditional IRA's are raised.The bill helps Hawaii small business. Self-employed small business people will be able to deduct 100 percent of their health and insurance costs--the current deduction is 40 percent, reinstates the home office business deduction, and provides an immediate jump in the estate tax threshold to $1.3 million--$2.6 million for couples--for small family farms and businesses. This provision is important, because it enables continued family ownership of small farms and businesses from one generation to the next.Yet, I cannot rise without sharing my greatest concern with the tax bill: the airline ticket tax. The changes proposed in the airline ticket tax will have an adverse affect on Hawaii's people and our economy. The segment portion of the domestic ticket tax is unfair. It is particularly unfair to Hawaii where Aloha, Hawaiian, and Mahalo, our local interisland carriers, provide short-haul trips between the islands. Our unique geography as an island chain makes air travel a necessity. Unlike other areas of the country we do not have a choice. If individuals want to travel from Island to island we have to fly. In order to make it economical for our people Aloha, Hawaiian, and Mahalo island hop. The domestic airline ticket tax shifts the burden to low-cost short haul carriers. These are our local carriers. This will hurt Hawaii.The ticket tax increase on international flights from $6 to $24 is another concern. Tourism is Hawaii's largest industry. International visitors are a vital part of our tourism industry. The change in the ticket tax on international flights puts a greater tax burden on international visitors. International tourism is a major foreign exchange earner for the United States. It is one of the bright spots in our balance of payments picture. It generates millions of American jobs. Why do we create a disincentive to travel to the United States.Mr. Speaker, I will not dwell on the airline ticket tax any further, except to say that I will work with all my energy to repeal these provisions in the future.This is an important day for the people of Hawaii and our Nation. H.R. 2014 provides the people of Hawaii and our Nation with tax relief. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition and I am sorry to have to do this, particularly because I value my friendship with the gentleman from Arizona and with my dear friend, the gentleman from Mississippi, as well. As someone on the steering committee of the impact aid coalition and someone who was education chair in my State and had to try and deal with the implications of the failure to have the level of funding necessary for impact aid, I find myself in this uncomfortable position of having to oppose the amendment. I hope, actually, by the time this discussion is over they maybe would consider withdrawing it or not bringing it to a vote in the hopes that we will not end up in a situation where people can say, ``Oh, well, I was for impact aid and you were against impact aid.'' Because, very frankly, and I hope that we can get attention for everything that is being said from everyone before we are through, that when this comes down to a question of funding, which is what it does, we are actually in the wrong venue.This should be a line item in the Department of Defense budget. This is not a position, I would tell the gentleman from Arizona, that I am just coming up with in response to this amendment. This argument goes back to an argument I had as chair of the education committee in the State of Hawaii and brought up here to Washington almost 2 decades ago. This should be a line item in the Department of Defense budget. For those Members who do not know this, we fund our schools overseas at 100 cents on the dollar. Not my answer to the gentleman from Arizona, but my response, and I trust he would understand the difference both from a political sense and personally, is that I not only understand the capital problem that he is having, the capital assets problem in terms of the facilities in the school, but also in paying the teachers and in the operating expenses that are involved. To have the children, the dependents of our military personnel, dependent on the particular circumstances of property taxes, however we do the funding in Arizona or Hawaii or Mississippi or elsewhere, is virtually, from my point of view, immoral. It is not fair. Those children are there by the assignment of the U.S. Government and their parents are there in our name acting in our behalf, and this should be funded out of the Department of Defense as an obligation.If we can fund our schools at 100 cents on the dollar in Korea, in Germany, or wherever, and I suppose if things keep on going, in Bosnia by the time we get through, then we should certainly do it in the confines and the boundaries of the United States of America.My first essential point to the gentleman is that rather than pit workers against children or one element of government against another element of government, or however people choose to characterize this debate for their own purposes, not for ours in terms of our discussion, we are going to end up with that kind of a dichotomy being put forward, and I believe it is a false dichotomy. I do not doubt for a moment that the funding is needed in exactly the way that he says it is, and I would support it. This is why I think we should work together within the coalition, and this is no news to those who know of my participation in the coalition, that we should move this, and I would like to work with the gentleman, and anybody else who is interested in it, in moving the whole funding nexus from the Department of Education and into where it properly belongs, into the Department of Defense.Pending that, I think it is an exercise not so much in futility, but an exercise in false confrontation or false dichotomy to try to pull the money from, whether it is NLRB or wherever else it might have come from, in order to do the necessary funding here. We need to make the fight, it seems to me, on the basis of the merits of the Impact Aid Program across the board and that that should be funded as a result of our commitment to the dependents of our military personnel across the board.I do want to say that rather than continue in a vein as to which one of us is more morally correct or whether or not one is depriving an essential necessity of governmental operation in the United States of the funding necessary to do its job in order to benefit the children.The CHAIRMAN.

But I have been through this.I have had someone attack me for no other reason than personal, political gain. I have had to go through the process of being sued for slander by someone who attacked me, who attacked my integrity, who came after me for no purpose other than to try to destroy me politically, and I had to go through it. I had to have an attorney.Anybody who stands here and talks about an outside group being able to come into this House and make a complaint, as if we are cutting off access, people who have no desire other than to come and to take them apart, not just politically but destroy them as a person.I am willing to submit myself at any point to the judgment of my peers in this House. But I am unwilling to open up the floodgates of the crime of slander and libel against a Member that will surely come with this. I have been through it.I ask any Member to think about what it is like when all of this is put out in the newspapers and people ask them about it and the attack is on them, and they wake up in the middle of the night in frustration and rage, knowing that they are innocent.I was attacked by somebody who altered a tape on the grounds that he knew what I was really saying, so he had altered the tape to make sure that everybody else would know it. He found an attorney that could come after me. And the day before the trial started, after all the depositions, after all the accusations, the suit was withdrawn. I was left to hang. And do my colleagues know what the attorney said to me? ``If you want to counter sue, you are going to have to pay for that.'' This was done for no other purpose than for political attack.I respect the work that was done with this.

Here it is, 1,299 closely spaced pages of small print.I am sure the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston] and the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Cardin] have seen this volume. They probably see it in their dreams at night, tumbling off shelves and burying them. But the fact of the matter is that this contains the Constitution, Jefferson's Manual, and the rules and practices of the House of Representatives. That is what we are talking about.That is why I think that this amendment that the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning] and I are bringing forward deserves your favorable consideration. We should have the full committee if you are dealing with the two fundamental issues, whether the scope should proceed forward or whether there should be subpoenas issued, to be dealt with in the manner in which it has been discussed with this amendment.I have been told, and I see that the Judiciary chairman is here, that if this is an amendment sponsored by the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning] and the gentleman from Hawaii [Mr. Abercrombie], it should either pass unanimously or be defeated unanimously.I am not quite sure how that will work out, but I think what it indicates is that this is not a partisan consideration. We are putting this forward because we believe it is in the interest of the House as an institution, because we love this body, because we have sworn an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, and when you defend the House of Representatives, when you defend the basic fundamental integrity of the House, you are defending this Constitution, you are defending these rules. This book is as sacred as we get in a secular context in our House of Representatives in our country.Therefore, I would like to say at this point, then, that the Members, especially the gentleman from Maryland and the gentleman from Louisiana, deserve our thanks for their hard work, their levelheadedness, and I want to say their largeness of spirit. The manner in which this has been conducted is proof of that, and I am very, very grateful for this opportunity to speak on it.All we are saying here is that only the subcommittee authority be renewed from its source when it moves into new areas of investigation. By clarifying that point, we strengthen the measure before us, we strengthen the Ethics Committee and its work, we strengthen the integrity of this House, we strengthen democracy.

These instructions will set aside a small amount of funding for the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys to provide assistance to the victims of human rights abuses in the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands.Since at least 1984, Federal officials have expressed concern about the CNMI alien labor system. Worker complaints over wages and working conditions are continuing undiminished according to the third annual report of the ``Federal-CNMI Initiative''. The governments of the Philippines and China have expressed concern about the treatment of their citizens in this U.S. Commonwealth and allegations persist regarding the CNMI's inability to protect workers against crimes such as illegal recruitment, battery, rape, child labor, and forced prostitution.Without Rep. Miller's language in H.R. 2267, individuals who have been the subject of human rights abuses--right here in the United States--have only the charity of private relief organizations to rely upon for help. In Hawaii, the Filipino Solidarity Coalition is currently providing sanctuary to a young girl named ``Katrina'' who came to Hawaii as a government witness. When Katrina was 14 she was brought to the CNMI by an employer who promised her a good job and fair wages in the restaurant industry. When she arrived in the CNMI her hopes for a better life were destroyed. She discovered that the employer had lured her to the CNMI under false pretenses. Not only was she confined to her assigned living quarters but she was also forced into service as a prostitute. Katrina had few options and even less money but she escaped her confines and filed suit against her employer with the help of the local Philippine consulate. When Katrina's actions were revealed to her employer, her life was threatened. To escape the abusive situation, the consulate helped her to find refuge in Guam. However, Guam's close proximity to her former employer still put Katrina in a dangerous situation.Through the help of the Filipino Solidarity Coalition, Katrina managed to escape to Hawaii where local donations and a small grant from the Department of Labor helped to provide her shelter, food, and further legal assistance. However, there are many others who remain in the CNMI still suffering the abuse and indignity that Katrina managed to escape. I appreciate the Chairman's support of the Miller language which will help those like Katrina who are victims of human rights abuse, not far away in a foreign country, but right here in the United States of America.",

The amendment removes the bill's current provision that is an impediment to provide for a fair and accurate census in the year 2000. This issue is very important to the people in my district. In fact, this is an issue that is important to all my House colleagues. We must work to ensure that all individuals are counted so that their voices may be heard.The 1990 census missed at least 4 million people because, as the Bush administration's Census Director at the time said, ``enumeration cannot count everybody.'' We in Congress must take steps to resolve and correct this situation. The Mollohan-Shays amendment seeks to address the issue and make the 2000 census more accurate.The National Academy of Sciences and virtually the entire statistical profession, including the American Statistical Association, has endorsed sampling as the best and most efficient way to achieve an accurate census count.The Justice Department under the Reagan, Bush and Clinton administrations has consistently held that sampling is constitutional.Opponents of the amendment claim that sampling opens up the census count to political manipulation. In response, the sponsors of the amendment went out of their way to address that issue. An independent board of experts will monitor every aspect of the census to guard against any bias or manipulation. This safeguard creates a more effective barrier against fraud and error than under the present system.The Congressional Research Service analyzed the Hastert census language that is currently in the bill, and it is quite clear that this language will not work. According to the memorandum, ``The case law makes it clear that this authorization, if enacted, would run afoul of constitutional barriers to congressional conferral either of standing or of ripeness or both.'' The memorandum goes on to say ``* * * it appears extremely likely that the Supreme Court would either strike down the provision, or disregard it.'' If my House colleagues are concerned about constitutionality they cannot support the Hastert language.The Mollohan-Shays amendment works toward a fair and accurate census. I urge my colleagues to support the Mollohan-Shays amendment.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am delighted to be here today, particularly in the company of the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton], my good friend. I too want to pay tribute not just to him and his great leadership on this issue but to the especially strong staff support we have received along the way with the enactment of this bill.Madam Speaker, I am just getting to the floor now because we have had the opportunity over the past couple of hours to be meeting on the questions of travel, tourism and the world, not only in relation to the United States but in relation one to another as people throughout the world.Madam Speaker, I cannot emphasize enough to Members that in paying particular attention to this species as covered under the Asian Elephant Conservation Act, we are taking a giant step forward in seeing to it not only that we respect the ecological consequences for the Asian elephant as such, but that we recognize that in this context, the people of the world are coming to know that we are all interrelated, and we are very, very hopeful that we will be able to fund as a result of this act partnerships, international partnerships, that will result in people being able to view the Asian elephant, to understand through the conservation of the Asian elephant its relationship to ecological balance, environmental balance in South Asia and that this is beneficial on a planetary basis when all of the species of the world understand their interrelationship.This is then a modest step in the effort to protect the existing Asian elephant herds from multiple sources of danger, including poaching for meat, hides, teeth and bones as well as capture for domestication and the encroachment of humans and civilization, so-called.Madam Speaker, the population of Asian elephants as has been pointed out, has been dwindling steadily and now numbers roughly 40,000 animals. It is an incredible thing to contemplate, as we did in the course of our examination in the committee hearings, what such a relatively small number of great animals and of course I must say parenthetically, Madam Speaker, that my respect for and admiration for the diversity of life on this planet was only enhanced by the hearings that we had. This is indeed one of God's most magnificent creatures and indeed represents something unique. Not everyone is aware that the Asian elephant has been a partner with humankind throughout all of the thousands of years of its existence. That relationship is now threatened by the advance of modern life.Maybe advance is almost the wrong word, Madam Speaker. But nonetheless we are realizing more and more that this great creature of South Asia, the Asian elephant, represented a true symbiosis between humankind and the animal kingdom that is now threatened. The numbers are less than 10 percent of the numbers of African elephants in the wild. I think that that is a very sobering statistic. The African elephant of course has received great publicity. It also of course is magnificent in its presentation of self in the wild and has attracted the imagination and admiration of people throughout the world. The Asian elephant being a blue collar animal, a working animal, a domesticated animal working in close proximity with human beings, has been ignored in the process.So this legislation will help prevent the eventual extinction of the Asian elephant as an endangered species. The future of these magnificent animals in the wild is in clear jeopardy. H.R. 1787 authorizes $5 million to fund projects crucial to the survival of the species. Our goals are to assist and support the conservation of elephant range, as the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] has enunciated so clearly and to support the United Nations Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Although wild Asian elephants are scattered across 13 Asian countries, there are only 4 remaining herds containing 1,000 or more animals.Douglas H. Chadwick, a distinguished and honored scientist and author, wrote of these animals:Elephants are one of those animals by which we define the grandeur of creation. No larger life forms walk our earth and precious few are more intelligent. Elephants are more than just a part of the extraordinary variety of the plants and animals found in Asia's tropical forest. Elephants are one of the main reasons that the genetic bounty is there in the first place with the potential to provide humanity with new sources of food, fiber and pharmaceutical products. Elephants distribute seeds of perhaps one-third of all tropical trees. In some cases elephants are the only known agents of dispersal. To save Asian elephants is to save one of the principal shapers of biological diversity. To maintain habitat is to maintain the resources that enrich human communities over the long run.I am absolutely certain, Madam Speaker, speaking parenthetically that with the expansion of the Asian elephant habitat and with their preservation and conservation, we will see enormous increases in travel and tourism and by extension the awareness of the items that I am speaking of. Going back, then, in my quotation, ``To pass an Asian Elephant Conservation Act would be one of the most foresighted and yet practical, cost-effective things we can do for the benefit of Americans, people throughout Asia, and the world we all share.''H.R. 1787 received overwhelming support in the Committee on Resources, again under the leadership of the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton]. I was pleased to be an original cosponsor of the bill. Not only does H.R. 1787 enjoy strong bipartisan support in the House, Madam Speaker, but it has also been endorsed by such diverse groups that bears repeating, the American Zoological and Aquarium Association, the World Wildlife Fund, Wildlife Preservation Trust International, the Sierra Club, and Feld Entertainment, emphasizing the partnership we have in the private sector. Feld Entertainment is the owner of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus.It is clear that if we are to prevent the extinction of the Asian elephant, a number of coordinated and visible activities must be undertaken by the international community and host-range nations. I believe it bears repeating, Madam Speaker, as to what they might be:Protection of the remaining elephant populations and their habitat from further loss and degradation by establishing and managing special protected areas;Promotion of coexistence between people and elephants by developing and implementing sound management practices that would prevent or reduce conflict;Promotion of effective law enforcement through participation of local communities;Reduction of captures from the wild, and extension of care and humane management of the remaining domesticated population;Madam Speaker, I believe it has been stated but I believe again bears repeating that the Asian elephant as a participant in society as a domesticated work elephant, I was going to say workhorse, I guess is the equivalent, is now finding itself in the situation of being unemployed.The work elements associated with the Asian elephant are disappearing much as the workhorse did, as the great workhorses that my grandfather was associated with as a teamster in Buffalo, NY, the great eight-horse hitches that the great beer wagons that we see advertised now with Budweiser, they were working animals. My grandfather was the manager of the stables that carried baked goods on great wagons throughout Buffalo for the then existing Hall's Bakery. So horses, great workhorses, were displaced by engines, by the internal combustion engine. The same thing is happening to the Asian elephant. The elephants who worked under these circumstances need to be taken care of, need humane management and treatment, and this bill will help agencies and individuals and groups interested in this in completing that task. Finally, restoration of the congenial relationship that previously existed between people and elephants through education and awareness programs. And of course this is where travel and tourism can play a great role.Many groups and individuals contributed to the development of the bill. The Tiger and Rhinoceros Conservation Act is one to be cited. It would be administered by the Secretary of the Interior after consultation with the Administrator of AID. Instead of focusing on remedies appropriate for trade-related conservation issues, this bill emphasizes remedies that would address the human-elephant conflict resolutions that prevails throughout the Asian elephant's natural range. I think I have already made reference, Madam Speaker, to the African elephant and I am particularly grateful to the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young], the chair of our committee, who has been instrumental in working with the preservation and conservation of the African elephant and who realized that the Asian elephant emphasis that we have in this bill is an appropriate next step to take.The purpose then of H.R. 1787 is to assist initiatives in the Asian elephant range nations as well as regional and national agencies and organizations whose activities directly or indirectly promote Asian elephant habitat conservation. Then the bill would be funded in a manner so as not to affect funds currently earmarked for the African Elephant Conservation Act and the Rhino and Tiger Act. The legislation would specify that support would be provided for projects that would directly support and promote wild elephant management practices such as monitoring population trends of known populations, assessing the movement and the annual ranging patterns of known populations. We would emphasize law enforcement through community participation, develop management plans for managed elephant ranges, translocation of elephants, conflict resolution initiatives and community outreach and education. It specifically authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to fund projects addressing the use of domesticated elephants as such use relates to conservation of Asian elephants in the wild. It provides for multiplying the impact of funding by authorizing priority to be given projects which have matching funds from private sector sources.In that instance I, too, want to add my congratulations and grateful thanks to our colleague Andy Ireland, who brought this issue to our attention in an extraordinarily comprehensive way and in that context, Madam Speaker, I want to conclude by urging all of our colleagues to take advantage of the pioneering work that was done in the Committee on Resources previously with respect to conservation of the great animals in Africa and Asia and add to it then this great and magnificent representation of the symbiotic relationship of humankind and the animal world in the Asian elephant.Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from American Samoa [Mr. Faleomavaega].",

    "title": "CONCURRING IN THE SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H. CON. RES. 8, REGARDING CORAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Madam Speaker, before I rise in strong support of the Senate amendments to House Concurrent Resolution No. 8, I want to assure the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] that in the statement of the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller], that I submitted on the Asian elephant resolution, that it did not contain a statement, as rumored, that while he was in favor of increasing the number of Asian elephants in South Asia, that he was for decreasing the number of elephants on the Committee on Resources.Madam Speaker, this resolution brings much-needed attention to the crisis that coral reefs are facing worldwide. I commend yet once again the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] for his leadership in introducing and passing House Concurrent Resolution No. 8, and for focusing on the subcommittee's attention on the value of and threats to coral reefs.I also want to praise the efforts of the ranking member, the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller] for his concern over cyanide fishing and the need to promote sustainable coral reef fisheries, ideas incorporated in the Senate amendments to the resolution.Coral reefs, as I have every opportunity to observe, being from Hawaii, Madam Speaker, are vital to the environment and the economy of many islands and coastal States, territories, and nations. They are among the most biologically diverse and productive ecosystems on Earth, rivaling the tropical rain forests on land. The hard structure of the reef is built up over thousands of years by the secretions of tiny living coral animals, so a coral reef is truly a living structure. As a living structure, thousands, perhaps millions, of individual coral animals are dying, and others are taking their place on the reef at any one time.The problem now is that human activities have shifted that balance, and coral reefs are dying off at an alarming rate worldwide. Coral is very sensitive to water pollution, sedimentation, damage from boat groundings, or even simple physical contact by divers. These largely inadvertent injuries are a significant cause of the well-documented decline of coral reefs worldwide. Coral reefs are, in a sense, the canary in the coal mine of the ocean.A great deal of injury is also being inflicted on coral reefs, mainly in Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific through largely illegal fishing techniques. Cyanide and other elements, such as dishwashing liquids, are being used to stun fish for capture for the aquarium trade and for the live food fish trade.The demand for live food fish, fueled by increasing affluence in Asia, has resulted in widespread depletion of stocks of the preferred species. As a result, the live-capture boats are moving into even more remote and thus more pristine reefs. Most of the aquarium fish captured by these techniques end up in hobby tanks in the United States, I am sorry to say. Most of the live food fish end up on plates in the homes and restaurants of Southeast Asia.More damaging than the depletion of coral reef fisheries, these chemicals kill nearby coral, and divers scrambling to get fish out of the nooks and crannies of the reef often cause substantial physical damage to the reef. In fact, research has shown that cyanide kills reef-building corals at concentrations many thousands of times less than that used by live-capture divers. While depletion of certain fish species threatens the ecological balance of the reef by removing key predators and grazers, the destruction of the reef building corals themselves tears at the very fabric of the ecosystem.Although the State Department, NOA, the Department of the Interior and other agencies are working through the international coral reef initiative to identify and reduce threats to coral reefs, they need our help. Thus, this resolution before us today.These kinds of unsustainable fishing practices would not be occurring if powerful market forces were not at work. The U.S. and Asian consumer demands for reef fish is, in part, driving its destruction of coral reefs. Yet, how many aquarium hobbyists would purchase a wild-caught reef fish if they truly understood that in doing so they were contributing to the destruction of the reef environment that they sought to reproduce in their tank?Furthermore, if affordable alternatives to wild-caught fish were available, would the educated consumer not choose them? This has worked very well in the exotic bird trade, and we can do the same for reef aquarium species and specimens.Many of the countries where the reefs are being destroyed, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and others, have laws on the books that protect the reefs, but there is little money for enforcement, and the more lucrative the market, the more people are willing to risk the penalties in any case.So the keys are information and education. Only by identifying these destructive practices and consumer demands that drive them can we begin to eliminate or modify them, and only through the development of sustainable coral reef fisheries can reefs be saved.This concurrent resolution before us today, Madam Speaker, No. 8, brings the global plight of coral reefs before Congress. It is intended to raise the level of awareness of policymakers and asks us to do more.The scientific and environmental communities have declared 1997 the International Year of the Reef. We cannot stop ships from running aground on reefs, and we may not be able to stop global warming at this stage, but what better time for us to pay attention to the many problems plaguing coral reefs and seek practical solutions to those threats that we can address? If we do not do something soon, there may not be any reefs left to save.With these thoughts in mind, Madam Speaker, and again thanking the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] for his leadership on this issue, I urge the House to adopt the resolution.Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.",

Very few people are happy in any given year with the bill because it covers such a wide range of items.

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.Mr. Chairman, I want to speak in favor of the amendment that the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller] has just outlined. I want to make an appeal to Members of the House.Mr. Chairman, I am a Member of the House of Representatives, proud to serve here and I think, Mr. Chairman, you know that I have said on more than one occasion that respect for the House includes being able to win and also understand what losing is all about, being defeated.The last two amendments did not come out the way I voted. I understand that and I accept that. But, Mr. Chairman, what I am hoping is a basic sense of fairness can prevail. Those votes were close. People were paying strict attention to what it was they were voting on. And I think we have to give the best possible motivation and express goodwill toward one another with respect to our votes.So my appeal on asking Members to vote for this amendment is one based on fairness. With all due respect to the previous speakers, this is not a question of closing borders; this is a question of whether we are going to extend the same privileges explicit, I would say, Mr. Chairman, in the last two amendments to foreign-controlled corporations.Mr. Chairman, I do not think that this can be reduced to an argument about whether or not we are treating our western brothers and sisters fairly or those in the majority of areas where the grazing takes place. It is one thing for us to involve ourselves in a discussion as to what is the appropriate legislative approach on grazing land. It is another thing to subsidize foreign-controlled permittees. I do not see how we can make an argument based on fairness, based on fairness to the American taxpayer, that would allow us to do this.All the amendment of the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller] is saying is that if businesses come in and make these investments as a foreign-controlled permittee, that they should not be allowed to have the benefit of the American taxpayer dollar. This is not an assault on anyone overseas.Mr. Chairman, I would be very interested to see what kind of argument would be made when we look at the kind of laws that apply against Americans being involved with owning land and being able to extract minerals or to engage in other kinds of agricultural business in other countries.Mr. Chairman, we are always the ones that are expected to do the producing for others in terms of fairness. What we are asking for is fairness for the American taxpayer here. Surely those who in good conscience made their votes on the other two measures can look to that same conscience to see, is this really the intent of those who favored the law as it is presently applied? Is it really the intent that these foreign-controlled permittees should be involved in this way?Mr. Chairman, this is far from mischief. I do not think it is fair to characterize it that way. This is a fundamental question about what we have as a legislative foundation for the application of these laws. We have had our arguments, we have had our discussions as to whether the existing law and how it is applied, Mr. Chairman, is fair and appropriate. Surely it is a legitimate question. Far from being capricious or mischievous, it is a legitimate question as to whether the law ever intended this.I ask, Mr. Chairman, that as Members come to vote on this particular amendment, can they in good conscience say that it was the intent and is the intent of this legislation to subsidize the foreign-controlled permittees? I think an honest evaluation, a fair evaluation would come to the conclusion it is not. And therefore I ask that we vote favorably on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller] in the spirit of what has been accomplished here today in terms of the legislative process.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Florida [Ms. Ros-Lehtinen]; the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman]; the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon]; also the gentleman from California [Mr. Martinez] and the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Hamilton], and the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Pelosi] have led the way on this bill, on these series of bills.I rise in support of H.R. 2358. This bill relates to imprisonment, to abuse and human rights violations perpetrated on nonviolent political activists in the People's Republic of China. It goes without saying, Mr. Speaker, that U.S.-China relations are important, and that our government should pursue improved ties with China. It is equally important, however, that the pursuit of improved relations should not cause us to forget the victims of human rights abuses.Our concern stems from widely recognized standards of international behavior and our core values as a Nation. It is in the context of those values and standards, standards which the People's Republic of China has herself formally subscribed, and I want to emphasize to the Members, we are not trying to impose anything on the People's Republic of China, other than what the People's Republic has already signed up for.We as Members of Congress call the world's attention to ongoing human rights violations and prisoners of conscience in China and Tibet. One of the most effective means, Mr. Speaker, of directing attention to the plight of such prisoners is to focus on the circumstances of individual prisoners. By doing so, we transpose the issue from the realm of abstraction to real-life men and women whose bodies are subjected to torture and neglect, whose minds are cruelly punished with techniques deliberately designed to induce confusion, demoralization and despair.Time and again, ex-prisoners of repressive regimes tell us that the single most important gift they can receive is the news they are not forgotten by the outside world, that others know of their suffering and that others are working for their release. {time} 1745That is why the Congressional Human Rights Caucus and the Congressional Working Group on China and the emphasis in this bill is urging every Member of Congress to adopt a prisoner in China or Tibet, and to publicize his or her plight, and to demand his or her release.All of us, Mr. Speaker, can adopt one of these prisoners, make that prisoner our own, so they will not be forgotten. They will understand that the flicker of light of freedom will come from the floor of this House today and will shine, and those people will know it. It will warm their hearts and give them hope for the future.The self-executing rule for H.R. 2358 adds my amendment, which will include Mr. Ngodrup Phuntsog among the number of specifically named prisoners of conscience. Mr. Phuntsog is a Tibetan restaurateur whose crime was to provide tea and food to proindependence demonstrators. For this he was sentenced in 1989 on the spurious charge of espionage to 11 years in prison.Mr. Speaker, Mr. Phuntsog was sentenced to 11 years in prison. Think of it. We are gathered together here today on this floor, with all the freedoms at our command, and this gentleman sits in prison for 11 years, and an additional 4 years deprivation of political rights.It is feared that his treatment in Lhasa's Drapchi Prison is extremely harsh. We lack precise information on his health and treatment, but reports from our colleague, the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Frank Wolf] give cause for serious concern.Recently the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf] visited Tibet unofficially. He found widespread repression, including credible reports of the maltreatment of political prisoners, and my amendment helps direct the spotlight of international attention to the cell where Ngodrup Phuntsog and others are being held under conditions we can only imagine.My amendment complements the underlying bill by addressing the wider issue of human rights in China and Tibet. It calls for a policy which seeks the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience in China and Tibet, access to international humanitarian organizations in prisons in China and Tibet, to ensure that the prisoners are not being maltreated or neglected, and the commencement of negotiations between the People's Republic of China and the Dalai Lama without preconditions on the future of Tibet.I urge all my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, all my colleagues, to vote for the Nation's highest ideals, and to send, above all, a message of hope to prisoners of conscience in China and Tibet.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I will not take the 30 minutes, other than to say how proud I am to be able to stand here today and associate myself with the gentlewoman from Florida [Mrs. Fowler]. I have the good fortune, Mr. Speaker, to be associated, as well, with the gentlewoman from Florida [Mrs. Fowler] on the Committee on National Security, and in this instance I can say that I believe we are cooperating, if you will, in the same manner and in the same sense of commitment and dedication that is exemplified in the work on the Committee on National Security.This is, Mr. Speaker, most profoundly a human rights issue. It is not something that we are putting forward, or I should say the gentlewoman from Florida [Mrs. Fowler] has put forward, if I can speak for her in this instance, because of ideological considerations with respect to the very real differences that people may have with respect to questions of choice and abortion here in the United States. This, on the contrary, is a situation in which we are speaking of force.Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons that I became involved in political work in the first place was that I could not understand as a child, as a young man growing up, how people could do the things that they did that I discovered when I first was exposed to the Holocaust. I could not understand it. I could not comprehend it as a student.One of the things that propelled me in my academic career was to try to come to grips with what it was in us as human beings that caused us to be indifferent to the suffering of other human beings; in fact, to perpetrate death, terror, destruction, inhumanity, one to another.In this instance, Mr. Speaker, there is no question in my mind that the forced abortion and sterilization circumstances and actions which the gentlewoman from Florida [Mrs. Fowler] has outlined and which Amnesty International has chronicled is taking place.Mr. Speaker, this took place in Nazi Germany. If I learned anything over that period of time in my academic studies in my attempt to try to come to grips with what human beings are capable of doing to one another, I recognized that it is because we dehumanize other people that it is able to be done.Mr. Speaker, I believe you have had some experience yourself in warfare and in the destructive capacity that humankind has. We have not overcome it, but, hopefully, we learn something from it. One of the things I think that we learn, I hope that we learn, is that we cannot allow historical reference to simply be abstract, we have to see whether it applies in our own lives and our own time. It does little good.I can think, and, again, I would hope that I am not speaking for the gentlewoman from Florida [Mrs. Fowler] on this other than in a way that recognizes and is cognizant of the thrust of her philosophy behind putting this bill forward. It is one thing to recognize a Thomas More, that we must stand for those things which perk our conscience and which require us as human beings to make visible or expression of witness. That is what this is.I agree with the gentlewoman from Florida [Mrs. Fowler] that we are not in a position to command enforcement. That would be extraordinarily difficult. That is not an argument against it. That is an argument for us to stand up and do these things precisely because it is difficult.Bearing witnesses is not always an easy task. But because it involves logistical difficulties is not a reason to stop doing it or to urge that it be done. On the contrary, it seems to me it is even more pertinent and even more important that we stand up now.So this, I repeat, from my earlier espousal of the Ros-Lehtinen bill on human rights abuses toward prisoners in China and in Tibet, in China and Tibet, that we have to bring the light into the cells and we have to bring the light onto this situation of forced abortion and sterilization, not because we are trying to single out China and take a superior, a patronizing position, an imperialistic position, where we feel that we can condescend toward China in this regard. Quite the contrary. China is a signatory to various international covenants and treaties, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that is in the purview of the United Nations.Everything that we are doing with respect to these bills in general, and most particularly to this bill in particular, is a direct reflection of treaty and covenant obligations that we have as a nation, that China has as a nation, and that we as individuals surely express. It most certainly, I believe, exemplifies what we stand for when we take our oath of office, hold up our hand, Mr. Speaker, as all of us have been privileged to do on the floor of this House, to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.Inherent in that, that which has been given to us, the honor and privilege of serving here, is to reflect upon the philosophical basis of the origin of the Constitution which allows us to be free men and women here today. We are, in a very real sense, I believe, defending those who are unable totally to defend themselves under these circumstances.So, Mr. Speaker, I request the favorable attention of our colleagues. I hope that perhaps those young people might be in the same circumstances I found myself so many years ago, trying to understand how to be a human being, what it is that differentiates us from the other animals, the other species. I have come to the conclusion, and this bill is a visible manifestation of it, that all animals die, Mr. Speaker. The difference is in the details of their lives. And the details of our lives are such that we are able to reflect, we are able to imagine.Few animals are able to contemplate the nature of their deaths or the nature of the meaning of their deaths, let alone their lives. But we are capable, this species, homo sapiens, is capable of that and, in fact, is obligated to do that. We have to justify our lives on this Earth in the time given to us. This bill is one of the times we have to justify our lives. And in voting for it, I think we act on that obligation.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am not precisely sure of what the exact rule is, or what the Committee on Rules has put forward with respect to the possibility of an amendment of this nature. I have the greatest respect for the intentions of the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] in presenting this bill, both with respect to how the bill was put together and to what the implications of the bill are, and I would, far from speaking for him, nonetheless posit the proposition to the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] and Members of the House, that essentially what the gentleman from Mississippi is proposing is entirely consonant with the object of the bill before us.So in that regard, Mr. Speaker, I would like to just bring a bit of historical perspective to consideration of the bill.At one point, and I am sure the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] will recall, we had a Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee which concerned itself with, among other things, the terms and conditions of international trade on the high seas. I consider that I was a reasonably well-informed individual in my life prior to coming to the Congress, but nonetheless was rather shocked and very chagrined to discover the degree to which disregard for the rules of international trade and disregard for the contractual agreements that had been reached between the United States and other nations, particularly China, was the fact of the matter before us in that committee.We found that there were shipping trade violations, and I think the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Taylor] was a Member of that committee and could attest to the fact that I, among others, upon discovering it, simply could not understand why we do not enforce the rules we already have. I think we as Americans take some pride in the fact that we try to keep our agreements, we try to live up to our contracts. That was not taking place.We have just had recent evidence of what can happen when we do take a stand. The proposition of gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Taylor] is such that we can, if it is put forward and agreed to, take the kind of stand that has been exemplified, Mr. Speaker, in recent days with the decision of the Maritime Commission to fine certain Japanese companies, shipping companies, for not living up to the rules and regulations to which they had agreed and which we live up to.The fines were such that when they were imposed, that the executive, in the form, of course, of the President and his administration, was forced into the position, and, in fact, it may be apocryphal, but I heard at one point that the President or someone under his immediate authority said, can they do that? Who are these people? They are our Maritime Commission, and by God, they were doing their job. What their job was is not to turn the American people into suckers and saps, where they are not made to be fools. People know that when it is happening.One of the reasons there is cynicism abroad in the United States today is people know that they are being played for suckers. They do not like it. They want us, if we are on the floor of this House, free men and women elected by free men and women, to not be made fools of. They expect us to insist as legislators, as national legislators, that we carry these things out, that we see to it that the rules and regulations are obeyed. I think that is the intention of the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] with the bill.I would like to say that I support the idea of reciprocity, and would ask the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon], in the context of what is possible under the rules as applied to the bill, whether or not the intent of the proposal of the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Taylor], that is, that a review and reciprocity be instituted with respect to tariffs, might be possible to incorporate into the bill.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.Mr. Speaker, despite the subject matter, which I am sure the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] has explicated very clearly, this is in fact a happy day. That is to say that with the passage of the bill today, the Senate bill, S. 813, we will have addressed a very, very serious matter in a timely fashion, which is to say that the President will have the opportunity, hopefully, to sign this bill, perhaps as early as Veterans Day, upcoming Veterans Day.Mr. Speaker, I rise today then to urge my colleagues to support passage of S. 813, the Veterans Cemetery Protection Act, as amended by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. The gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] and I first introduced this bill in the House, and I am happy that we were able to work with the Senate to bring their version to the floor today for passage.As I indicated, it is appropriate that we are able to take up this bill as Veterans Day approaches. This bill instructs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to significantly increase criminal penalties for theft and willful vandalism at national cemeteries.First, Mr. Speaker, I would like to take some time to thank the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert], who gave me the opportunity to work with him on this requisite piece of legislation. It has indeed been a pleasure to work with him, and I am pleased that together we have been successful in our effort to move this bill through Congress.I might say as well, Mr. Speaker, that I have had an opportunity to work with the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] as the ranking member on his subcommittee and the Committee on Resources previous to this, and it has been an extraordinarily enjoyable time for me, legislatively and personally, to be associated with him.I would also like to sincerely thank the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Stump] and the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde] for recognizing the need for this legislation and for working with us, the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] and myself, and giving us their support in moving this issue forward. The gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] has been extraordinarily patient in this endeavor, and I very much appreciate it.I would likewise like to thank the gentleman from Florida [Mr. McCollum], who has also made a significant contribution to this bill, and I would like to extend my personal gratitude to him. I have had the opportunity to work with him in other areas as well, juvenile justice for one. And I appreciate the opportunity to extend to him my personal congratulations in helping to get this forward and extend to him my personal thanks.On April 19, 1997, Mr. Speaker, seven Oahu cemeteries on the Island of Oahu in the State of Hawaii, including the National Cemetery of the Pacific at Punchbowl and the Hawaii Veterans Cemetery, were vandalized. Vandals used red spray paint to write racist and profane words on grave markers and cemetery and chapel walls. It is obvious that nothing is, in fact, sacred to the people who committed this act. Strict penalties must be enacted to send the message that we will not allow this type of behavior to continue unchecked.As we have heard from the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert], this was not the only desecration of a national cemetery to occur in the country. Unfortunately, this type of crime is on the rise. On May 18, 1997, the New Jersey National Cemetery was also vandalized just prior to Memorial Day. These acts are an insult to the veterans who gave their lives to ensure our freedoms and to their families. Further, it is an affront to all men and women who have served or are presently serving in our Nation's Armed Forces.I regret to say, Mr. Speaker, but it is entirely a propos that, unfortunately, just yesterday, and I arrived a little too late to know whether the gentleman from California [Mr. Calvert] entered this into the Record, but there was a Scripps Howard News Service story just yesterday, ``Vandalism Rising At Veterans Cemeteries.'' Coincidental, Mr. Speaker, of course, to the passage of the bill today, but very pertinent in terms of asking the Members to support it. The story says, in part, ``Lawmakers hope President Clinton will sign the bill into law on Veterans Day, on Tuesday.''I want to indicate that under the sentencing guidelines which I mentioned, in case it has not been made a part of the Record, it gives guidelines to the judges, directing them to increase the penalties for convictions of theft and vandalism at the national cemeteries. The measure before us would set prison terms for up to 10 years for anyone convicted of vandalism causing more that $1,000 damage and up to 15 years for thefts at the national cemeteries.I would like to conclude, Mr. Speaker, by indicating that today we are voting to send that message that we will not forget the sacrifices made by those who made the ultimate sacrifice and that we will not tolerate further desecration of our Nation's cemeteries.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the bill to extend the Native American Veterans Housing Loan Program and for other purposes.In July I introduced H.R. 2317, the House companion bill to S. 714. I am pleased that we are able to take up the Senate's version today. I would like to thank the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Stump] and the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Evans] and the staff of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for working hard to strike the compromise which made it possible to take up this bill on the floor today. I would especially like to thank Debra Wada of Senator Akaka's staff and Jill Cochran of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for their hard work on improving benefits for native American veterans.In 1992, the Native American Veterans' Home Loan Equity Act was enacted to establish and implement a pilot program to make direct housing loans to aid native American, Indian, Alaska or Hawaii Native or Pacific islander, veterans in purchasing, constructing, or improving dwellings on trust lands.The Department of Veterans Affairs has successfully entered into agreements to provide direct loans to members of 46 Indian tribes and Pacific island groups. The VA is in negotiation with hundreds of other tribes to establish memorandums of understanding which would make this program available to those tribes. It is important that we extend this program to allow those native American tribes who are still in negotiations with the VA to have a chance to apply for these loans.Through June of 1997, 164 loans were made to both Pacific islanders and native American veterans, with 90 applications pending. To date none of those loans issued has been foreclosed. This is an extremely successful program and is the only program available for this group of veterans who live on trust lands to finance homes for their families. The Department of Veterans Affairs supports the extension of this program.Therefore, Mr. Speaker, the main issue here is equity. Native American veterans have a right to the same benefits available to other veterans. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.",

    "title": "VISA WAIVER PILOT PROGRAM",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report on H.R. 2267, the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill.One of the provisions included in the bill is a 6-month extension of the State Department's Visa Waiver Pilot Program [VWPP]. This is the mechanism by which our country allows visitors from approximately 26 nations to enter the United States without visas. Passports are sufficient for entry.And this is a good program. Obtaining visas is a time-consuming endeavor, from applications, screening, approval, and to issuance. We do not need to require visas of every visitor from abroad, and the Visa Waiver Pilot Program has been a tremendous success for years in expediting foreign visitors, whether for employment, tourism, family, or business purposes.I have been working closely with Congressmen Barney Frank, Jay Kim, and others with the leadership of the Immigration and Claims Subcommittee, particularly Chairman Lamar Smith and ranking Democrat Mel Watt, to resolve a problem--specifically whether Portugal and the Republic of Korea should be included in the visa waiver program. They have exerted tremendous time and energy and effort to identify and resolve problems in the program and we are committed to working together in the months ahead to adjust the program so that citizens of these countries can travel to the United States with only a passport.Mr. Speaker, during the hearings and committee consideration of the visa waiver program, concerns were raised by some Members and the State and Justice Departments. I do not believe those concerns are insurmountable, and we are working with those agencies to address security and other concerns. We all feel that the current waiver criteria should be reformed, and I will be working in the months ahead with my colleagues to craft a visa waiver system that expands visitor opportunities.As you know, tourism is the dominant industry in Hawaii, and it is crucially important that we have a visa waiver system for tourists that allows a maximum number of visitors to enter the United States. Thousands of Hawaiian families and individuals are dependent on tourism and on the number of visitors using hotels, restaurants, transportation facilities, and retail businesses. A strong case has been made that citizens of Korea, one of our strongest allies in the world, should be given the waiver consideration that we have afforded 26 other nations.The 6 months extension of the existing Visa Waiver Pilot Program is a prudent decision, and reflects a good-faith effort being made to address constructively the issues facing the future of the program. I look forward to working with Chairman Smith, the members of the House Judiciary Committee, and those seeking an expansion of the program to develop an effective and workable program addressing all concerns.",

    "title": "THE HAWAII FEDERAL MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PERCENTAGE ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 1998",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce legislation to adjust the Federal medical assistance percentage [FMAP] rate for Hawaii to more fairly reflect the state's ability to bear its share of Medicaid payments. I am pleased that my colleague, Representative Patsy Mink, has joined me as a sponsor of this measure. I am also happy to join our Senate counterparts, Senator Daniel Akaka and Senator Daniel Inouye, in putting forth this legislation. In November 1997, a similar bill, S. 1376 was introduced by Senator Akaka.The Federal share of Medicaid payments for each state varies according to the state's ability to pay. Because per capita income is the determining factor for ability to pay, wealthier state bear a larger share of the cost of the program through lower FMAP rates. In Hawaii, per capita income is relatively high. Thus, the State's FMAP rate is 50 percent, the lowest level. Under this bill, Hawaii's FMAP rate would be increased from 50 percent to 59.8 percent.The rationale for the FMAP rate change is quite simple. Hawaii's high cost of living skews the per capita income determining factor. Based on 1995 United States Census data, the cost of living in Honolulu is 83 percent higher than the average of the metropolitan areas. More recent studies have shown that for the state as a whole, the cost of living is more than one-third higher than the rest of the United States. In fact, Hawaii's Cost of Living Index ranks it as the highest in the country. Some government programs take the high cost of living in Hawaii into account and funding is adjusted accordingly. These programs include Medicare prospective payment rates, food stamp allocations, school lunch programs, housing insurance limits, Federal employee salaries, and military living expenses. These examples show a Federal recognition that the higher cost of living in noncontiguous states should be taken into account in fashioning government program policies. It is time for similar recognition of this factor in gaging Hawaii's ability to support its health care programs.An excellent analysis of this issue is included in the twenty-first edition of ``The Federal Budget and the States,'' a joint study conducted by the Taubman Center and Local Government at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government and the office of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. According to the study, if per capita income is measured in real terms, the State of Hawaii ranks 47th at $19,755 compared to the national average of $24,231. Thus, Hawaii's 50 percent FMAP rate is understated because cost of living factors are not considered. Per capita income is a poor measure of Hawaii's relative ability to bear the cost of Medicaid services.In addition to the high cost of living, the Harvard-Moynihan study finds that Hawaii also has one of the highest poverty rates in the nation. The state's 16.9 percent poverty rate is ranked eighth in the country, compared to the national average of 14.7 percent. These higher cost levels are reflected in state government expenditures and state taxation. On a per capita basis, state revenue and expenditures are far higher in Hawaii, as well as Alaska, than in the 48 mainland states. The higher expenditure levels are necessary to assure an adequate level of public services which are more costly to provide in our states. Of the top 10 states with the highest poverty rates in the country, the Harvard-Moynihan study finds that only 3 others have an FMAP rate between 50 and 60 percent. The other six states have FMAP rates of 65 percent and higher. Even more revealing is that of the top 10 states with the lowest real per capita income, only Hawaii has a 50 percent FMAP rate.During consideration of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Senate included a provision increasing Alaska's FMAP rate to 59.8 percent for the next 3 years. Setting a higher match rate as was done for Alaska would still leave Hawaii with a lower FMAP rate than a majority of the states, but would better recognize Hawaii's ability to pay its fair share of the costs of the Medicaid program.I hope to make my colleagues in the House of Representative colleagues cognizant of the need for this legislation and to earn their support for its passage in the 105th Congress.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I too rise in strong support of the bill. S. 927 provides a strong reauthorization of the National Sea Grant College Program which, for over 30 years, has addressed important local, regional and national marine resource problems through education, research and public outreach.The legislation before the House is a compromise with the other body. It reauthorizes Sea Grant for 5 years. It clarifies the roles of the national office and the Sea Grant colleges. It strengthens competitive peer review for grants and contracts for research, education and outreach, and generally brings Sea Grant up to date as a modern education and research program.The authorization levels in the bill will fully fund Sea Grant's ongoing base program, while providing additional funding for certain research priorities, which include nonindigenous species, oyster disease, and toxic microbe Pfiesteria.While I do not question the validity of research in these areas, I regret that some Members have felt it necessary to question whether all of these research options are necessary. One of the sea grant's great strengths over the years has been its ability to respond rapidly and effectively to local and regional needs, Mr. Speaker. I think that that is something that is now involved in the program in a way that both the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton) and myself can support. There is no reason to think that it will not continue to do so; that is to say, respond effectively to local needs under its usual effective peer review processes.I would like to express my appreciation for the cooperation that we in the minority have received from the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton) and the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) and the staffs on this bill.I can assure my colleagues that on this bill any partisan considerations were put to rest with respect to the thrust of the legislative activity under consideration. This is not, therefore, a bipartisan bill, this is a nonpartisan bill. I think all of us who represent coastal areas have long appreciated the benefits of this practical and noncontroversial program. It is a good bill, reauthorizing a popular program. I am glad we are doing it at this time. I most certainly urge the House to support this legislation.Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).(Mr. GREEN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)",

I am looking at the gentleman from California (Mr. Miller) right now who is smiling at me, and trying to get over the hush that came over the crowd as someone moves to this side. I am looking for the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), my very able chairman.I point that out because this is a nonpartisan issue and is being cast, I am very sorry to say, in somewhat partisan terms, not necessarily by party but partisan terms, as if there is a right side and a wrong side. As the gentleman from Puerto Rico (Mr. Romero- Barcelo) has indicated, as the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton) has indicated, as the gentleman from California (Mr. Miller) has indicated, and the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), what we are trying to do here today is to aid and assist, as Members of the House of Representatives, the self-determination of fellow citizens.The gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton) has been adamant on this. I do not think we are going to find a more partisan person in the House with respect to the question of English and its being used as common language throughout the United States. But that issue will be debated in another venue, at another time.What we are talking about here is something that I ask Members, as a representative from the last State to come into the Union. We have only been a State for 38 years. We have been a State for less years than many people in this body have been alive and serving in public office.So it is very, very particularly poignant in some respects to me today to stand here as someone who was not born in Hawaii and has the privilege to serve in Hawaii.I was born in the east of the United States, in Buffalo, New York, in the area represented by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Paxon) today. It never occurred to me that one day I would have the privilege and honor of standing in the well of this House to serve the people not only of Hawaii, but of the United States of America.That will happen in Puerto Rico. We cannot determine ahead of time what is going to happen there. The conventional wisdom, as some will recall, when Hawaii and Alaska came into the Union, was that Hawaii would be a Republican State, and, indeed, we elected a Republican Governor in our very first State election, and that Alaska would be a democratic State.As you know, that has worked differently. We have had Republican office holders here, we have had Democratic office holders here. This is not a partisan issue.Mr. Chairman, I appeal to my Republican friends, please, take into account that our fellow citizens are merely asking for the opportunity to determine their future.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak against this bill, and reluctantly because of my friendship and high regard for the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), which I think goes without saying, as well as my regard for the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Gejdenson).Nonetheless, I feel, Mr. Speaker, that it is imperative that everyone recognize, as has been indicated by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) our ranking member on the Committee on National Security, that this particular purchase has not come through the procedures and hearings in National Security. I believe we should properly have jurisdiction in this regard.We are criticized constantly for having a defense budget that is not adequate, or we are criticized for the transfer of technology for profit as opposed to actually meeting the defense interest of this country, and I most certainly understand the idea that we have to defend ourselves against drugs. But in this instance we have advanced navigational and plotting systems associated with the Blackhawk that I believe may very well fall into the category of transfer of technology which many members of the Committee on National Security on a bipartisan basis oppose.Now, I believe that we will be taking funds away from Peru and Bolivia. Whether that is true or not, I am not exactly certain because we have not had the hearings on it. Colombia, as has been well stated, already has a minimum capacity apparently at the present time to deal with the Black Hawk program. Yet, I understand that Colombia is cutting its defense budget.Now, if we are to form that budget forum, I think that we need to make that part of the dialogue that takes place in the Committee on National Security. Black Hawks are used by our frontline troops. The administration, I understand, is indicating that it will propose super Huey helicopters that are adequate for the drug missions, that can be utilized for night vision, for example, and that the situation now about insurgency requires that we take very, very careful notice of whether or not the military utilizing these helicopters would be people who are actually going to take up the cause against drug trafficking. The corruption factor, aside from those who are heroically trying to pursue it right now within the Colombian military, is a very real question that needs to be answered.Now, we have already had arguments on this floor or discussion on this floor today about the capabilities of the Black Hawk versus the Huey helicopter, the survivability of the Black Hawks versus the Huey helicopter. That is the proper jurisdiction and purview of the Committee on National Security. I think that we need to take it up in that context.My understanding is, as well, that the administration is claiming, as has been asserted elsewhere, that we will be taking away from the budget allotted to counternarcotics programs elsewhere in Latin and South America.Now, Mr. Speaker, that may be the case, or it may not. I am not entirely certain. But I do know this, that in order for us to proceed on these matters, I implore my colleagues, please make these kinds of things a matter of joint jurisdiction with the Committee on National Security which sets the policy here. I think there is a fundamental point not just of procedure in the House, but of acting in the best interests of the security interests of the United States by asking that this be done.If we are going to simply move to the appropriations committees and have the appropriations committees make these decisions with respect to expenditures, how are we supposed to put together a rational national defense policy in coordination with the international relations aspect that we need to sustain and maintain?I think, Mr. Speaker, that the distinguished chairman, and I mean that in every sense, that is not a pro forma utilization of the word by me. The distinguished chairman of the Committee on International Relations would agree that those of us who are on the national security side of policy have worked with him in the past and in every instance where he has requested it. He knows that not only myself, but every member of the Committee on National Security would be willing to work with him in any instance where the international relations and national security interests of this country are at stake.On that basis, I would appeal, then, to the chairman of the Committee on International Relations to recognize that our interest is legitimate and that we want to work very closely with him to have a resolution of this matter that would be in the interest of everyone, Colombians and the people of the United States alike.",

    "title": "CREDIT UNION MEMBERSHIP ACCESS ACT",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Access Act, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the bill today.Development of this bill is the product of long and hard work, not only by the House Committee on Banking which has brought the bill to the House floor, but by millions of individual members of credit unions across the country who let Congress know of the importance of the Supreme Court decision on this matter earlier, and of the need to move H.R. 1511 as a result of that decision.The legislation we are considering today is a compromise that ends a dispute largely between credit unions and the nation's banks. Federal regulators had interpreted federal law to allow multiple common bond memberships, and one result was a rapid increase in credit union membership. The increase in credit union membership came at a time when there was an expansion in the scope and type of services they had traditionally provided members, resulting in competition with commercial banks, thrift institutions and other financial services. Congress is now in the process of redefining the nature of all financial institutions so it is timely that we make a specific decision on the nature and scope of credit unions and the services they provide. And I believe enactment is H.R. 1151 is essential for competition with the new types of financial institutions now becoming a reality with the distinctions ending between banks, insurance firms, securities and commercial businesses. This bill is about making sure consumers have a choice, today and in the future.With a population of 1.3 million people, Hawaii has more than 550,000 credit union members in 113 affiliated credit unions. Hawaii's traditional cultural values have resulted in one of the strongest credit union movements in America. Many first generation immigrants brought with them a system called tanomoshi. Workers and families in sugar cane and pineapple plantations in Hawaii pooled savings from which loans were provided for emergencies or more often for one family to start a business. When the business prospered, the funds would be repaid to the group and it would revolve to another family. In this way, much of the business, middle class in Hawaii developed from its plantation agriculture economy. The reality is that we had credit unions in Hawaii long before the mainland. It was simply called tanomoshi instead of credit unions. This is a grass-roots democratic movement built on the foundation of self-help and group identity.H.R. 1151 allows current credit union members to continue their membership. New membership groups must have less than 3,000 common bond members at the time of joining, and groups will be within reasonable proximity to the credit union. However, there are circumstances when even these restrictions can be waived. It is important to credit union members as well as to their competitors that depositor insurance provisions be strengthened under the bill. It would also require that ``persons of modest means'' within each credit union membership field be served.Mr. Speaker, I believe H.R. 1151 is a solid, reasonable and responsible compromise. We must have a healthy and vigorous credit union movement in the 21st Century to meet the needs of individuals as well as the need of the nation for a diverse, competitive financial industry.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Illegal Foreign Contributions Act, H.R. 34.This bill, if enacted, would ban contributions to federal election campaigns by legal permanent residents. I believe this would be a colossal mistake and a constitutional blunder. This bill would restrict the First Amendment free speech rights of Legal Permanent Residents. These residents are required to perform citizenship obligations, such as registering for the military draft and serving in the armed forces, but we would deny them the basic citizenship rights we require them to defend.Consistently throughout federal constitutional law, Legal Permanent Residents have all First Amendment freedoms of full U.S. citizens. This has been consistently upheld by the federal courts and the Supreme Court. H.R. 34 would deliberately abridge and deny those rights in the name of campaigning finance reform. It would trample on the constitutional rights of hundreds of thousands of people without justification. The bill picks out a specific group of people and says we are going to prevent you from expressing your political views.This bill is a gag of political expression in the disguise of campaign reform. The reality is that hard-working, tax-paying, military-serving individuals are being told they can have no say over who is elected to determine the policies that determines their fates and lives.Mr. Speaker, I also fear that legislation that singles out specific groups of people for treatment different than that of citizens will lead us down a road to finding scapegoats when there are failings in our government and society. This is a dangerous precedent, and I urge my colleagues to think carefully before they cast their vote on H.R. 34, and to vote against this ill-conceived ``reform''.",

    "title": "MAIL FRAUD AND TELEMARKETING SCAMS TARGETING SENIOR CITIZENS",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call my colleagues' attention to a serious crime being perpetrated against some of our most vulnerable citizens: mail fraud and telemarketing scams targeting senior citizens. In my own district, one gentleman pleaded with me, ``The mail is still coming. I don't have the money to send.''Some companies peddling questionable products or promoting unwinnable contests make a living out of targeting senior citizens. It is estimated that telemarketing fraud robs Americans of at least $40 billion a year.The actual number may be much higher, as telemarketing fraud has always been a part of our Nation's underground economy. Not all losses have been clearly documented. Some consumers are too embarrassed to report that they have been defrauded or they do not recognize the extent of the fraud that has been perpetrated upon them.Mr. Speaker, I held a meeting on this issue in my district recently; and I was appalled at the number of people in the audience who came up to me after a discussion led by members of the FBI, led by members of the Post Office, the Postal Inspector Section, after the recitation of statistics and perspective by myself, and yet asked me afterwards if I could give them my personal assistance in contacting some of the fraudulent companies to see if it was not possible for them to perhaps receive their prizes or be acknowledged for the funds that they had been sending.Mr. Speaker, I can assure my colleagues that this is a heart-wrenching situation. It is taking place all over the country, and it prompts me to rise today to extend these remarks to my colleague and to the other Members.Older Americans, Mr. Speaker, are the target of many fraudulent telemarketers because they are generally at home more often than younger persons, they may be more trusting. That is certainly the case with those that I spoke with recently in Honolulu, Mr. Speaker, and may look upon a smooth-talking telemarketer as a trusted friend rather than someone preying upon their life savings. These fraudulent activities are a disgrace, and we should do all we can to stop them.On April 8, 1998, as I indicated, I sponsored a mail and telemarketing fraud briefing for senior citizens in my district in Honolulu, Hawaii. This education national briefing was designed to give vulnerable senior citizens a fighting chance against an industry designed to victimize them.John Gillis, a supervisory special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Honolulu, and Byron Dare, a postal inspector for the United States Postal Service in Honolulu, presented testimony on their agencies' efforts to combat mail and telemarketing fraud and educated seniors on how to avoid becoming victims of such schemes.Mr. Speaker, I most sincerely urge my colleague and other Members to take advantage of FBI offices in our districts, as well as postal service inspectors in our district, to hold similar briefings for senior citizens in our areas. Senior citizens need to be protected from these scam artists, and one of the best ways to do this is educate them on how fraudulent information is presented.I am preparing legislation on this issue. I am already a cosponsor of the Protection against Scams on Seniors Act, H.R. 3134. This bill authorizes the Administration on Aging to conduct an outreach program to educate seniors on telemarketing fraud. I plan to continue my outreach efforts to reach Hawaii's elderly population from falling prey to these unscrupulous mail and telemarketers.I also support the efforts of Federal agencies and private organizations who have been actively involved in this issue. The American Association of Retired Persons, the AARP, has created a profile of telemarketing and mail fraud victims. The profile shows the average victim is not only an older American, but relatively affluent, well-educated, well-informed, and socially active in his or her community.AARP's research indicates that the critical difference between victims and nonvictims is their ability to recognize that telemarketing fraud is a crime. Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize that. The key here, the critical difference between being a victim and a nonvictim is their ability to recognize that telemarketing fraud is a crime.Many people find themselves the victim of fraud and do not recognize that it is, in fact, criminal activity, and there is something they can do about it. AARP has produced educational materials in English and Spanish. If seniors would contact the AARP in their area, they will be happy to provide them with materials, telephone numbers, et cetera, which will aid them.The AARP has produced educational materials in English and Spanish that inform recipients of telemarketing calls about ways to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent calls; how to respond safely to calls without becoming a victim; and how to report suspicious calls. I am making sure this material is available in all the senior centers in Honolulu.In Hawaii, state laws on telemarketing require specific disclosures by the telemarketer regarding prize and gift promotions. Our state law also provides consumers with a right to sue for damages and obtain relief on his or her own initiative, aside from any state action. Maximum penalties for a violation of Hawaii's telemarketing laws are set at $10,000.Uncovering these schemes, returning money owed to its victims, and educating seniors are worthwhile efforts I will continue to pursue. I am happy to have the support and knowledge of many organizations who also promote these goals. I will continue to educate senior citizens in my district of this $40 billion rip-off. I hope my fellow Members of Congress will do the same. With a concerted effort, we can protect our senior citizens and put mail and telemarketing con-artists out of business.",

    "title": "FUNDING FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I call on both the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House to pass the $18 billion International Monetary Fund as soon as possible. It is urgent for Hawaii's citizens, workers, and the businesses that I represent.In early winter 1997, economies in South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia collapsed. The effects on Hawaii have stifled recovery from the deepest recession the State has experienced in 50 years.Problems began when the Japanese economy faltered in 1991. Tourism and direct foreign investment plunged. Devaluation of the yen and now other Asian currencies have resulted in the Hawaii recession.Unemployment is at 6.5 percent. And by the way, Mr. Speaker, the 6.5 percent may not seem very high to some others in the country who have experienced much greater percentages in times past, but for Hawaii that is a very, very high number.Tourism last month dropped 14 percent from March a year ago. Costs for the Japanese tourist or businessperson are more than 50 percent higher than they were in 1991. Investment decline has resulted in construction contract receipts falling 40 percent since 1991. Business and individual bankruptcy are at record high levels.Business, labor, industry, and government in Hawaii are working on solutions but cannot provide direct economic aid to Asian countries or restructure Asian economies. Only Congress can and must do that in conjunction with the IMF.Current funding proposals have been derailed over unrelated issues, such as abortion. There are adequate vehicles for dealing with those issues, and the leadership should drop them and bring an IMF bill to the House floor immediately.Economists indicate it will take 1 to 3 years for Asian economies to recover, even with IMF aid. Although there is no quick fix, we must start now, because Hawaii and the U.S. economies are being damaged by inaction. And I stress the U.S. economy in general as well as that of Hawaii in particular, Mr. Speaker.Knowing the relationship between IMF and America's foreign trade, which includes tourism and the movement of investment capital, President Clinton recently said that IMF funding was something ``we owe to the future of this country and to our children.'' That certainly applies to Hawaii.That is why I wrote today to the Speaker and Democratic leader, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Gephardt) urging immediate action. I have the letter here, Mr. Speaker, and I will submit it as part of my remarks.Threat of economic destabilization remains, and delay is only intensifying the problem. The IMF must be allowed to do its job, including helping restructure the economic systems in Asia which resulted in the need for the multibillion-dollar bailout. But the IMF cannot do its job without the funding necessary to stabilize these economies.Mr. Speaker, we must not put America's economic well-being at risk by ignoring the Asian financial crisis. We must not put Hawaii's economic well-being at risk by ignoring the Asian financial crisis. I urge that the IMF bill, the International Monetary Fund bill, be brought to the House floor immediately.Mr. Speaker, the letter I earlier referred to is as follows: Neil Abercrombie,Dear Mr. Speaker: On behalf of the people of Hawaii who have been suffering through the toughest economic times in more than half a century, I urge that the funding bill be brought to the House floor expeditiously. I am deeply concerned about the failure of the House of Representatives to act on the $18 billion in emergency funding for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to deal with the Asian financial crisis. As you may know, during the last quarter of 1997, a financial crisis swept through several Asian countries. In response, the IMF came up with proposals to strengthen the economies of Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia and, in the process, reduce the threat of destabilization to the rest of Asia and the Pacific Rim. In this regard, it is vital that Congress provide the IMF with the necessary resources to adequately deal with the Asian financial crisis. Failure to enact IMF funding potentially jeopardizes our nation's ability to sustain economic growth. In Hawaii, the effects are more immediate. The Asian financial crisis, combined with the problems of the Japanese economy, has already had a negative economic impact on the state. Continued neglect by Congress will exacerbate this situation and make it more difficult for Hawaii to deal with its greatest economic challenge since statehood. Since 1991, Hawaii's economy has been stagnant. Since that time, the bankruptcy rate has skyrocketed and our unemployment rate has grown and now ranks among the highest in the nation. The primary reason for Hawaii's economic problems can be attributed to the decline in travel and tourism from Japan and other Asian countries as well as the consequences of direct foreign capital being withdrawn from investment in the state. In March, the number of visitors to Hawaii was down by 40,000 compared to the same time last year. The most dramatic loss was in the number of East-bound visitors from Asia which declined 14 per cent. Equally profound is the impact of the Yen currency devaluation. Today, it costs a Japanese tourist or businessperson 50 percent more to stay in Hawaii than it did in 1991. No sector of Hawaii's economy has been left untouched. Take for instance the construction industry; contract receipts for construction fell in 1997 to $2.9 billion, down from $3.2 billion in 1996, continuing into a 40 percent decline since 1991. Emergency funding for the IMF will not provide a quick fix to the Asian financial crisis. The situation in Asia developed over decades and economists have indicated that the IMF-supervised policy adjustments will take one to three years before they take hold. Yet, passage of the $18 billion in emergency financing for the IMF funding is a necessary step in resolving the crisis. I fear that inaction by Congress will only intensify the problem. I understand there are many members of Congress who hold strong views on issues which have become inextricably and unfairly linked to the IMF funding bill. Congress has many legislative vehicles with which to deliberate issues such as the abortion policies of other nations. Holding the IMF funding hostage to unrelated issues is not fair and runs counterproductive to the efforts of all sectors of Hawaii society--business, industry, labor and government--to resolve our economic problems. Although there are steps that all of those parties can and are taking, it is far beyond their authority to address the need to restructure economies of Asian countries. That is the proper role for the IMF, Congress, and the federal government. I strongly urge that you and the other members of the Republican leadership take immediate steps to resolve the emergency funding issues for the IMF. We should not put the well-being of our nation's economy at risk by ignoring the Asian financial crisis. Emergency funding for the IMF cannot be held captive to unrelated issues.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding to me. I am delighted to have the opportunity to be here with my colleagues on the Committee on National Security, most particularly with the chairman of our Subcommittee on Military Research and Development, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon).As the gentleman has indicated, our efforts here on the committee and the subcommittees which makes it up are of a bipartisan nature. It has been my honor and privilege over the years to serve under Mr. Aspin and Mr. Dellums and now the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spence). During that time, I think that we have grown in our respect for one another and certainly I want to acknowledge the commitment that has been made by all of the Members, regardless of their party and background, to the security interests of this Nation.Mr. Speaker, there is a popular fashion in political circles these days with respect to the idea of limited service in the Congress. That, I suppose, has its place in the discussions that ensue throughout the Nation as to how we can best serve our country and our national interests. But I can assure my colleagues that with respect to our national security interests and the defense interests of this country, what is required is a commitment and a dedication of years, I might even say decades standing, in order to be able to provide the broadest possible umbrella of knowledge and perspective as we come to these very crucial decisions by our Nation as we enter the next century.Mr. Speaker, I dare say, not speaking for Chairman Spence by any stretch of the imagination, that in his 28 years of service here to the Nation and service to our committee, that even today he feels there is much to be learned, much that we have to share with one another in order to come to a proper perspective. And why? The reason is that we do in fact have 435 votes in this House, 218 votes to make a majority. Those who say that votes do not count, those who say that this is just business as usual, those who denigrate the Congress of the United States, let alone the House, and more particularly those who do not understand that when it comes to the security interests of this Nation, that we have to have knowledgeable, dedicated people who are on a nonpartisan basis going to pursue what those interests are and how to achieve them. If we do not have that understanding, then we are doing a disservice to this Nation.Now, for the record, I would like to indicate that the Committee on National Security approximates, I would say, approximately 10 percent of the House of Representatives and I think represents a very broad perspective, probably reflecting the ideological and philosophical commitments of the House of Representatives as a whole.In that context what we have is individuals assigned to committees who then make it their business to immerse themselves into the business of that committee. I am going to focus this evening just particularly on the subcommittee on which I am privileged to serve under the chairmanship of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon). That is the Subcommittee on Military Research and Development.Now, on the surface it sounds pretty simple. We do the research and then we develop from that research. But let me just read a summary of today's action that was taken in committee, a summary of the bill language: Navy mine countermeasures program management; future aircraft carrier transition technologies; the manufacturing technology program; national missile defense policy; limitation on the funding of medium extended air defense systems, the MEAD system that the gentleman referred to; funding for the cooperative ballistic missile defense programs; the counterproliferation support; and the ballistic missile program elements.Mr. Speaker, I can say these things and they roll off of my tongue and my colleagues are familiar with what they mean. But the implications of this are stunning in terms of the dollar value and, of course, in terms of the strategic value associated with the national interests of this Nation and in fact the security interests of the world.The gentleman from Pennsylvania, who I would venture to say, I think without contradiction, is the leading exponent and expert, certainly congressional expert, with respect to missile defense, someone who I might say is always prepared, would agree that unless and until we are prepared just in one context that I will mention alone, unless we are prepared to deal with missile testing as well as training associated with the weapons systems that we are acquiring, the weapons systems we are researching, the weapons systems we are developing, unless we are prepared to deal with the missile testing element in that, we will not be prepared to move forward in meeting our strategic national interests. We will be unprepared.Now, it sounds strange. How can we possibly not be prepared with billions of dollars at stake, with years and years of research, with all kinds of development capabilities, major corporations, in fact international corporations the size of which will almost beggar the imagination of the ordinary citizen contemplating them, how could we not possibly be prepared? The reason is that the technology involved just in the recitation of some of the program elements that I have just outlined, the technology involved is so expensive, the technology involved is so complicated and detailed, the sophistication, Mr. Speaker, is almost beyond comprehension.I just recently visited the Comanche helicopter development facility in Florida, and asked just to have a briefing, Mr. Speaker, on the capacity of the helicopter not to have information intercepted, on being able to have the communications system, a highly sophisticated system, not be compromised in any way. This is very, very important, Mr. Speaker, because if we do not have this, if there is not a clear understanding of what the technology is and how we can protect the communications interests associated with the Comanche helicopter, it becomes available to those who could do us harm or wish us ill in the future.Mr. Speaker, we have to deal with questions of technology transfer. As the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) and the gentleman from South Carolina (Chairman Spence) know, I am, shall we say, an adamant opponent of the transfer of technology for profit's sake, presumed profit's sake, maybe individual dollar profits for some corporations and individuals, but certainly not for the profit of the interests of the United States. I oppose that.Mr. Speaker, the dollars that have been spent and the time and the energy and the intellectual input that has gone into just the communication system of the Comanche helicopter system is such that a full appreciation for the work of the committee I think would follow from any honest person's evaluation of what we are trying to accomplish.So as we contemplate research and development, I think that we have to take into account, Mr. Speaker, how are we going to do the funding? How are we going to achieve this?What is happening right now, and if the gentleman from Pennsylvania would care to engage in a bit of dialogue with me on it at this point, I think can elucidate this a little and illustrate it. Mr. Speaker, I realize the time is short so I will try to make this a summation.In my service on the committee, in trying to deal with issues, for example, like missile testing, the assumption I think of most Americans is that there is an adequate missile defense right now to meet any challenge that might come to the United States. But the fact are that those systems do not yet exist?",

We will hurt the capacity of the individuals and the groups who make up our Armed Services to be able to prepare themselves for the contingencies that they might face, and that in fact is where we find ourselves today.So I want to conclude, Mr. Speaker, thanking the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Chairman Weldon) and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spence) for the opportunity to participate with them and indicate as a member of the Subcommittee on Military Installations and Facilities and the Subcommittee on Military Research and Development, that I recognize fully the necessity of finding the proper funding mechanism and the proper funding balance in order to provide a defense that we can say with full confidence to the American people we will be able to provide for the security interests of this Nation.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I have in my hand the Asian American and Pacific Islander Journal of Health here from the autumn issue in 1993. It addresses the health status of Kanaka Maoli, the indigenous Hawaiians. It is written by my good friend Dr. Richard Kekuni Blaisdell.In the process of reviewing this, Mr. Speaker, you will find that the purpose is to summarize the current health status of the Kanaka Maoli, the indigenous Hawaiian people, with historical background, the underlying factors responsible for the indigenous Hawaiian health plight and recommendations.The principal findings, Mr. Speaker, are that the indigenous Hawaiians continue to have the worst health and socioeconomic indicators of the various ethnic groups who call their home Hawaii: cardiovascular disorders, cancer, diabetes, obstructive lung diseases, maternal and infant ill health, alcohol problems, obesity, major life-style risk factors, societal factors such as depopulation, foreign transmigration, colonial exploitation, cultural conflict and racism.Since 1990, Mr. Speaker, as a result of our native Hawaiian health programs funded here in the Congress and under our auspices, native Hawaiian communities have established five island-wide native Hawaiian health care systems to improve availability, accessibility, and acceptability of health services to all of the indigenous Hawaiian people, to provide them with resources.The health status is a grim one, Mr. Speaker, and I have to bring to your attention and to the rest of my colleagues the important matters which we have been addressing by congressional action and are now compromised.The House Committee on the Budget yesterday released a proposed budget for the Federal Government for the coming year. Mr. Speaker, I am saddened, not just outraged, but saddened by the effort contained in that proposal to eliminate funding for the native Hawaiian health care programs. Why the leadership of the Committee on the Budget and the leadership, Mr. Speaker, in the majority Republican Conference, has chosen to attack native Hawaiian health courtrooms is beyond me.The program addresses the documented needs of Hawaii's native citizens in a culturally relevant context. Of all of the races of people in the islands of Hawaii, the native Hawaiian people have had the most difficult times in health and social indicators. Why it is a position of the Republican majority to attack native Hawaiians is beyond my grasp at this time, Mr. Speaker.They are hurting people in the lowest socioeconomic status with the highest overall mortality rate, the highest cancer mortality rate, the highest accident rate, the highest years of productive life lost to chronic disease, the highest infant mortality rate. I could go on with this, Mr. Speaker. It is a litany that we are trying to overcome.These grim statistics can be attributed to the imposition of foreign cultures and practices upon the native Hawaiian people. Only since the 1988 introduction of the native Hawaiian health program have we begun to turn these statistics around. We need the budget for it, and we have achieved a balanced Federal budget in the process. I voted consistently to achieve that goal.Mr. Speaker, I will end my remarks now, but will put forward the statistics as well as the background on the proposal to end these programs for native Hawaiians by the majority. I hope, Mr. Speaker, by the time we finish our budget proposal that we will be able to reverse this proposal.",

    "title": "``MY VOICE IN OUR DEMOCRACY''",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend Zachary Hicks, a student at Hawaii Baptist Academy in Honolulu, who recently won the 1998 Voice of Democracy broadcast scriptwriting contest for Hawaii.Each year, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and its Ladies Auxiliary sponsor the Voice of Democracy contest to recognize writing and oratorical skills of students. Zachary Hicks related the democracy demonstrations of Tianamen Square in the People's Republic of China to the freedoms to enjoy and the need to exercise freedom of speech.I would like to share the script with the House and America, Mr. Speaker, which I am submitting. I am certain Leon and Brenda Hicks, Zac's parents, as well as his teachers and fellow students at Hawaii Baptist Academy, have great pride in Zac and his accomplishment.Not long ago, a number of young men and women broke out in protest of a government they did not believe in. With fear overpowered by conviction, these students stared communism in the face and said, ``We will no longer be shut up, pushed down, and unheard.'' That night in Tianamen Square, the cries for a democracy rang out loud and clear, yet they soon would be replaced by different cries. With hearts of fire, the students would not back down to words of warning. The air of freedom was faintly tangible but soon dissipated as the piercing crack of gunfire drove fear back into the hearts of the young people. Shot down . . . beaten . . . imprisoned . . . in one way or another they were all silenced. And the freedom, once so close, was now ripped from their hands. This tragedy can conjure up a lot of emotions. For me, all I can do is feel grateful. Surely I have taken for granted the freedom of a democracy. I have the privilege to stand up and not be pushed down. I don't have to look over my shoulder in fear every time I speak up about the government. I have a voice. But what is so beautiful about America's democracy is that this voice is just as important, just as valid as the next man's. Though led by presidents, governors, senators, and representatives, I have just as much power to speak out as they do. My voice matters. Our forefathers designed the United States Constitution to keep the government from ever becoming so powerful, so tyrannical, that I no longer have the freedom to speak my mind. At the same time, the constitution keeps me in line and helps remind me of what is important to our democracy, so that I fight for ideas that are true, right, and noble. Personally, I've only recently begun to see how powerful my voice is, even though it is just one. A project was assigned in my political science class in which I needed to interview various state representative and senators. I was surprised at how easy it was to schedule an appointment with an elected official. When I was sitting in the office of my representative, my eyes were opened to the power of my own voice. I used to believe that my voice meant nothing because I wasn't old enough to vote. But what is amazing to me now is that I'm able to walk straight into our state's capital building, climb a few stairs, enter right into an office of a senator or representative, and explain to them exactly what I believe and why I believe it. Not only that, our government allows what I say to be taken into consideration. I can persuade others to take up my passion, believe what I believe, and push for a change. Though funded in basic principles, democracy is not set in stone. If I don't agree with something. I have the ability to work to change it. America, the world's largest democracy, will take time to listen to what I have to say. Because my voice in our democracy matters so much, I hold a tremendous respect for the United States of America. I see the value in a peaceful transition of leadership. I see the value of a ``majority rules'' policy. I see the value of my voice. Therefore, I will not sit back when I have such freedom in my grasp. I will use my voice to make our democracy a better place to be. In the words of Edward Everett Hale, ``I am only one, but still I am one . . I cannot do everything, but I can do something. . . and what I can do, I should do . . . and, with the help of God, I will do.''",

    "title": "BROWN TREE SNAKES THREATEN HAWAII",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring an article in the June/July 1998 National Wildlife Federation magazine to the attention of Congress.The article, entitled ``A State Without Snakes Keeps a Wary Eye Out for an Alien Invader,'' describes the threat that Hawaii faces from the brown tree snake. As explained by the article's author, the brown tree snake has already devastated the ecology of Guam, and it is one of the most frightening alien species threatening Hawaii today. If it manages to become established in Hawaii, the snake could decimate Hawaii's entire bird population, as it has already done on Guam. It is also known to attack babies, eat pets, and cause frequent electricity outages by climbing power lines.Numerous programs in both the public and private sectors have been organized to contain and control the brown tree snake population. They deserve our support. Hawaii has unique and endangered plant and animal species, many of which would be threatened if the snake succeeded in establishing itself in the Hawaiian Islands. It is possible, but unlikely, that this event may have already occurred. Because there are no natural predators, one pregnant snake could establish this species on the islands.As we move toward consideration of appropriations in the weeks ahead, I look forward to sufficient funds being approved by the House for brown tree snake research and eradication.Fred Kraus lifts a piece of corrugated metal, inspecting the ground beneath it. ``You have to think like a snake,'' he says, while considering places where a reptile might hide. In the middle of a Honolulu suburb, this wooded ravine offers unlimited possibilities: waist-high grass, tangled brush, rodent burrows, illegally dumped trash, even clumps of houseplants growing wild. As the alien species coordinator for Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources, Kraus is investigating a report of a snake seen by a boy playing in these woods. The brown- colored snake climbed a tree until it was level with the eyes of the boy, who turned and ran. Throughout much of the United States, such a snake sighting would attract little attention. But in Hawaii--except for the harmless, earthwormlike Brahminy blind snake, which was introduced to the state from Asia--there are no terrestrial snakes. So any sighting suggests frightening possibilities. Given the Aloha State's subtropical climate and lack of predators, some of the world's most venomous snakes could easily become established there. Kraus is particularly concerned about the threat of an infestation by Boiga irregularis, the brown tree snake. The cause of a devastating ecological catastrophe on the island of Guam, it is considered one of the most frightening alien species threatening Hawaii today. Biologists believe the first brown tree snakes arrived in Guam after World War II as stowaways on cargo ships from one of their homelands: northern Australia, Indonesia, New Guinea or the Solomon Islands. Free of the natural controls of their native habitat and finding abundant prey for every stage of their lives, the snakes multiplied at an astonishing rate. Some areas of Guam are now infested with as many as 12,000 brown tree snakes per square mile and bird life of any kind is rare on the Pacific island. An extraordinary climber, the snake devours eggs, hatchlings and adult birds. It has decimated 9 of Guam's 12 native forest birds, pushing 3 species into extinction. Another imperiled creature, the Marianas fruit bat, is also close to extinction because of snake predation. ``The brown tree snake is capable of adapting to many tropical areas,'' says Thomas Fritts, a biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey who has been studying the species since 1984. Sightings of the reptiles have been reported in Okinawa, Wake Island, the Marshall Islands, Tinian, Rota, Diego Garcia, Texas and Spain. Biologists believe that most or all of these snakes originated on Guam. Known for its bulging eyes and large head, an adult brown tree snake averages four to seven feet in length. It is a voracious nocturnal hunter that kills by constricting its prey with a mild venom injected with its back teeth. On Guam, it has snatched chickens and pets from yards and has even attacked babies asleep in cribs. Guam's public health records indicate that 74 toddlers were treated for snake bites between 1989 and 1995. To date, the reptile has not caused any human fatalities. But it has caused other problems for people. According to authorities at Guam's electric companies, the climbing snakes frequently short out power lines, causing an average of one electric outage every three days. Because the brown tree snake is light sensitive, it coils into concealed hiding places by day. When it selects an airplane wheel well or outgoing cargo as its hiding place, the reptile can hitchhike to new habitats. Since 1981, seven brown tree snakes have been found in Hawaii. All were captured or dead upon discovery, bit some other reported snake sightings have not been resolved and authorities worry whether they can effectively stop the reptile from slithering in the state. As home to 41 percent of all endangered birds in the nation, Hawaii has a lot to lose. The state imposes fines as high as $25,000 for importing or owning snakes of any type--a penalty that has not stopped people from smuggling in pythons and other snakes for pets. But the brown tree snake threat is different. ``Never in history has a snake done as much ecological damage as this snake,'' says Mike Pitzler, a biologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Guam. Pitzler leads a team of federal, state, military and private individuals struggling to keep snakes from leaving Guam aboard outgoing flights and ships. The team maintains 1,400 snake traps in airports and other targeted sites around the island. It also relies on 14 Jack Russell terriers, which work in shifts around the clock, sniffing aircraft and cargo for snakes before departure. Pitzler's staff captures 3,000 to 5,000 snakes per year, but he acknowledges his program's limitations. ``Our canine teams are not 100 percent effective all the time,'' he says. ``There are also cargo items that are difficult to inspect.'' On the Hawaiian island of Oahu, meanwhile, five beagles put their noses to work sniffing out snakes on arriving commercial and military flights from Guam. For most flights, one of the dogs and an inspector are waiting at the gate to examine the aircraft. The pair then hurries to a nearby warehouse to inspect cargo from the flight. But because of a shortage of funds for the program, not all military flights are inspected and that worries state authorities. ``Is there an acceptable risk? The answer for Hawaii is no,'' says Mike Wilson, chairperson of Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources. ``Every brown tree snake that we don't stop now will turn into tens of thousands of snakes over the next 10 or 20 years.'' The species has a clutch size of 4 to 12 young and females may produce more than one clutch per year. Newly hatched snakes immediately begin to forage for food. On Guam, small skinks are readily available prey for the young snakes. An introduced alien initially thought to be harmless, one skink species is largely responsible for the population explosion of brown tree snakes on the island by allowing greater numbers of the snakes to survive into adulthood. ``The relationship between skinks and the brown tree snake's population is an example of what happens when you introduce nonnative plants and animals to a place,'' says Kraus. ``You can get a synergistic effect, things that you never expected.'' If one of the reptiles should slither off into Hawaii's landscape, Kraus usually oversees efforts to find the reptile. ``In some habitats in Hawaii,'' he notes, ``you could be standing right next to a snake and not know it.'' To search for the snake that chased off the boy in the suburban Honolulu ravine, Kraus brought in eight volunteers. The reptile was never found, though he concluded that it was not a brown tree snake because it was sighted during daylight. While Kraus continues his exhaustive searches, other experts are pursuing new methods to eradicate the reptile. But so far no such method has been found. ``We continue looking for solutions,'' says Thomas Fritts. ``We're not ready to give up.''",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support for enactment of House Resolution 404, regarding relations between the people of the United States and those of the Philippines.It is significant that we enact the resolution to salute and congratulate the Philippines on the 100th anniversary of its independence from Spain and its achievement of the establishment of its democracy.It is also noteworthy that the resolution also thanks the Philippines for aiding the U.S. in World War II, the Korean War and in Vietnam. It underscores the need for Congress to enact the Filipino Veterans Equity Act to extend full veterans benefits to Filipino soldiers who fought along side U.S. soldiers in World War II.Mr. Speaker, approximately 200,000 Filipino soldiers were under the command of General Douglas MacArthur during the early months of World War II. During that period, our armed forces in the Philippines were isolated from food, medical and ammunition supplies. Filipino soldiers displayed exemplary loyalty and courage in the defense of their nation and fought in every major battle, including Bataan and Corregidor.Beyond the outstanding conduct of the regular Army forces, after the islands fell to Japan, thousands of courageous Filipinos took up arms to continue the fight through guerilla warfare against enormous odds. Not only did they undermine the occupation forces, but they provided valuable intelligence to U.S. forces in the Southwest Pacific, rescued downed American pilots and diverted powerful enemy forces from deployment elsewhere.An estimated 60,000 to 80,000 surviving Filipino veterans, however, have been denied the full range and extent of veterans benefits available to American veterans with whom they fought side by side. This is an intolerable situation and we must resolve to remedy this tragic and insensitive dilemma.I urge my colleagues to review the provisions of H.R. 836, the Philippines Veterans Equity Act, and support the effort to bring the bill to the House floor for debate and enactment.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 1847, the Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act.H.R. 1847 increases criminal penalties for telemarketing fraud, especially telemarketing fraud targeting senior citizens. Older Americans are the targets of many fraudulent telemarketers because they are generally home more often, may be more trusting, and they may be led to look on a smooth-talking telemarketer as a friend rather than someone preying on their life savings.The measure is a positive step forward to protecting consumers and our seniors, but we need to do more. Besides increasing penalties on fraudulent telemarketers, we need to help educate consumers of the dangers of fraudulent telemarketing. I sponsored several mail and telemarketing fraud briefings for senior citizens in my district, Honolulu, Hawaii. These educational briefings were designed to give vulnerable senior citizens a fighting chance against an industry designed to victimize them. I encourage my colleagues to work with organizations such as the AARP and educate senior citizens in their districts.H.R. 1847 also allows law enforcement officials to prosecute individuals for conspiracy to commit telemarketing fraud. This provision allows police and prosecutors to seek out and punish organizers of telemarketing scams, who often arrange the schemes but don't actually commit the fraud themselves.Telemarketing fraud robs Americans of an estimated $40 billion per year. The actual amount may be higher, because some consumers are too embarrassed to report that they have been defrauded or consumers fail to recognize that they have been victimized.I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1847 and continue to work to eliminate telemarketing and mail fraud.",

    "title": "ADDRESSING HAWAII'S ECONOMIC RECESSION",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues in Congress for all of their cooperation in our fight to help Hawaii's economy and to explain why the fight is far from over and why we must redouble our efforts to find solutions to the State's economic problems.Over the last few months, I have had success in bringing new jobs to Hawaii. For instance, the defense authorization bill contains over $200 million for new, needed construction projects in Hawaii, a record level. This includes renovation and construction of the barracks at Schofield and Kaneohe Marine base, as well as funding for Navy family housing and the Pearl Harbor Public Works Center.Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues' constituents are members of the U.S. military and reside for at least part of their time in service at Schofield or Kaneohe or Pearl Harbor. The military is very important to Hawaii. Having the military in Hawaii itself is vital to our national interests. I strongly believe we need to maintain and build upon the military presence in Hawaii as we approach the 21st century in the interest of the national interests of the United States.In addition to this, this year's transportation bill included funding for several vitally important highway projects which will further stimulate the construction industry in Hawaii, as well as provide much-needed improvements. I extend thanks for myself and on behalf of the people of Hawaii for all of the help that has come from Washington recently as we try to work our way out of this economic recession.Mr. Speaker, I returned recently from Hawaii and continue to hear from families and businesses that economic conditions are difficult and, therefore, the need for action by the State of Hawaii and Congress is necessary to return the islands to economic well-being.Although much of the mainland has been experiencing strong economic growth, Hawaii, despite periodic spurts of recovery, in fact remains stagnant. The 7-year recession in Japan and more recently in Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand has resulted in declining tourism, Hawaii's lifeblood, and subsequently high unemployment, record bankruptcies, foreclosures, and declining property values. In short, Hawaii is experiencing the deepest recession since statehood.Beyond the hardship being experienced by thousands of families in Hawaii, there have been layoffs which triggered declining confidence in the economy. There has been a cutback in spending and fearing for the future, a very real and human reaction I might say, Mr. Speaker.The consequence, however, is additional economic contraction, more layoffs and every business thus is affected.There is, in the face of this grim situation, knowledge that we will get back on our feet. In time, the Asian economies will restructure, currency exchange rates will stabilize, tourism will rebound, and the economy will regain its strength. We must, however, take every action available at the disposal of the Federal Government to cushion the recession and provide the short-term economic stimulation necessary to see it through the hard times.In addition to the successes I mentioned earlier, there are some projects still in the works. I am happy to be working with the Small Business Administration and the Department of Commerce to identify resources that can be brought to bear on our problems in Hawaii.For example, the Commerce Department needs adequate funding for its community and economic development program. A $50 million appropriation would provide needed grants for planning and technical assistance many communities need which are experiencing the economic problems that Hawaii has.I am working with the Congressional leadership and administration to reestablish the spousal business travel deduction and increasing business meal and entertainment deductions which will help promote tourism, not only for Hawaii, but all over the mainland as well. I have introduced legislation to repeal the airline tax in last year's budget bill. The highway bill, as I indicated, provided Hawaii with $135 million in annual formula grants and will fund numerous priority projects. Money will be coming in, for example, to help needed improvements in Honolulu's harbor.I will continue to call on Congress to pass funding for the International Monetary Fund. It is all too evident to the people of Hawaii that when the Asian economies suffer, the economy of our State suffers just as greatly. I might add by extension, Mr. Speaker, the mainland as well.We should send this money because it is the right thing to do and because anything that stabilizes the Asian economies will help increase tourism and help to stabilize our own economic progress throughout the United States.We must also focus on securing long-term solutions to our problems, improve our education for our children, higher medical care reimbursement. In Hawaii's case, I am helping to diversify Hawaii's agriculture and to upgrade the Pacific Missile Range Facility to help bring Hawaii's military facilities, which I have mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, Mr. Speaker, into the 21st Century.I also want to upgrade Hawaii's telecommunications links to the mainland and the world.Tourism, the military and agriculture will continue to be Hawaii's key industries in the next century. We must, however, be well prepared to guide the changes underway. In the long run, technology development and innovation, as well as diversity within those industries, will lead us back to economic growth, jobs and prosperity. We must make wise decisions in this time of economic crisis.I look forward to working with my colleagues to resolve Hawaii's economic problems.",

A 7-year commitment is not very long when it comes to agriculture, when it comes to making banking decisions.When we talk about special interests, Mr. Speaker, I can tell my colleagues I do represent a special interest, the special interest of people living in Hawaii, in housing that they could not afford if they were not able to keep the jobs they have right now. We are standing up for those who are the field workers, for the farmers and producers.

How is it possible for us to say that we can compete in a market in which we have child labor producing sugar, when we have oligarchs in other countries producing sugar and dumping sugar in our market? That is not the kind of thing we would be very proud of as a legacy to the children of our country, to say that we violated labor standards, health standards, environmental standards, all because we wanted to have cheap manufacture of sugar.Mr. Chairman, I ask in conclusion, please, let us keep our word as legislators.

But here I want to emphasize to all of my colleagues that we are talking about legal permanent residents; people who have served in the armed forces. We are in a situation in which we can have convicted felons who cannot vote, they can give money to a political campaign, but a legal permanent resident who is paying taxes, working hard, raising their families is not going to be allowed to give.I am speaking right now because my colleague over there is the one who is going to be asked. I get out of it. I listened to some people on the floor say ``if I was asked''. I guarantee if someone looks like me, with the same physiognomy that I do, they will probably not get asked.

We have only to look at Guam to understand the potential extinction of many species will, not might, result from the introduction of the snake to Hawaii.Guam now experiences an instance of more than 12,000 of these snakes per square mile. Entire species have disappeared from Guam since World War II when the snake was accidently brought to the island, most probably abroad military aircraft which had visited areas of the South Pacific in the snake's natural habitat.The Interior Appropriation bill contains $2.1 million for prevention, education, and inspection programs, an increase of $500,000 over last year. We need to step up our vigilance in Hawaii against this invasive species which has brought wildlife ruin elsewhere.The scientific community has not yet developed an effective eradication method. Although I hope we can soon understand how to control and eliminate the snake, until that time, the only action we can and must take is preventing its introduction into Hawaii.I am very pleased that the Committee on Appropriations has recommended an increase, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in achieving the highest funding level to achieve our goals.",

We lost two good men and fine police officers. No words can adequately express our feelings on this sad occasion. Our hearts go out to their families and to their fellow officers.This tragedy highlights a dilemma as old as democracy itself: the balance between security and openness. We have made a decision--the correct decision, I believe--to maintain public accessibility to the Capitol. The people's business must be open to the public gaze. Every year people from our districts, some traveling literally thousands of miles, visit the Capitol to share their views and urge us to support or oppose this or that bill. They come to partake of the history that walks these halls. They come simply to see us in the flesh, look us in the eye, and take the measure of the men and women whom they have elected to make our laws. Their right to do so is enshrined in the very concept of democracy. Nowhere is it more appropriate to exercise that right than here in the people's house.At the same time, we can not escape the reality of the world in which we live.

Their bravery and devotion to duty enshrine the names of Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson among the heroes of our nation. We bow our heads in sorrow and gratitude.

    "title": "SPOUSAL TRAVEL DEDUCTION",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am introducing legislation today which will help America's working individuals and families, particularly those associated with the travel and tourism industry.My bill would re-instate the federal income tax deduction for expenses of persons traveling with spouses on business purposes. As you may know, the spousal travel deduction was a long established part of the tax code until 1993. At that time, President Clinton, as a part of his first budget to Congress proposed repeal of the deduction, along with many other tax changes. I supported his budget, despite reservations about some of the tax proposals, such as cutting the business meal and entertainment expense deduction from 80 per cent to 50 per cent, because they would have detrimental impact on the travel and tourism industry. Nonetheless, the need to reorder the nation's priorities was essential and overwhelming, and I voted in favor of the legislation.Supporting the 1993 budget was a difficult decision, but it was the correct one. It set the basis for rapid decline in the budget deficits which have plagued the nation for decades. We now have a budget surplus projected to be in excess of $50.0 billion. The travel industry and those states and localities dependent on the industry have sacrificed substantially in order to get our financial house in order.There is growing support for Congress enacting tax cut and reform legislation before we adjourn in October. I have worked closely in a bipartisan manner with the Congressional leadership, members of the Ways and Means Committee and with the Administration to generate support reinstating the deduction, and many have been encouraging on the proposal's merits and the beneficial impact that it will have on the economy.This bill is important to the working men and women of our country. The travel and tourism industry generates millions of jobs for our economy, and importantly, many of those jobs are entry level and give a first employment chance to less skilled workers, immigrants and those entering the job market for the first time. It provides an entry into the job market and opportunities for skill development, training and advancement. Representing a state and city very heavily dependent on travel and tourism, I have seen first-hand individual get a first break in the hotel and restaurant industries and advance in responsibility into management and supervisory positions. This is repeated throughout the country, but it is particularly apparent in areas with significant numbers of tourists, such as Honolulu, Las Vegas, Orlando, Los Angeles, New Orleans, San Francisco, Miami and countless other communities across the nation.I also believe that there are significant misconceptions about the spousal travel deduction. It has been unfairly characterized as wealthy businessmen traveling to exotic locations and deducting the expenses of the wife. The reality is the deduction has been much more frequently taken by traveling salesmen and saleswomen and small business owners attending trade shows or soliciting business in trips across the around the nation. It was a middle-income tax, not an abuse exploited by the wealthiest. The wealthy have tax shelters that pale the spousal travel deduction, shelters not available to the working men and women of our country. The vast majority of beneficiaries solid, hard-working, tax-paying Americans with a couple of kids, trying to make ends meet. Those are the people we should be designing the tax system to give a fair shake.I will be working in the next weeks and months in this Congress to move this legislation forward. Any tax reform or reduction legislation should address this issue. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in Congress to making enactment of this bill a reality.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spence) for their wise counsel and their ready availability to all the Members, including this Member, with respect to any aspect of our Committee on National Security reports and this conference report.Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank as well to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Hefley), my subcommittee chairman and my friend. Unfortunately, he is not on the floor at the moment, but I hope that my good wishes and good feelings towards him will be conveyed. I thank him for his leadership and for the fair process by which he has handled the military construction portion of the Defense authorization bill. His collegial and bipartisan approach encourages and in fact has yielded an outcome which shuns parochialism and constantly strives for the good-government solutions that this bill represents to difficult funding issues. It is made even more difficult by the constrained fiscal environment which has been mentioned.Mr. Speaker, I will not take up the Members' time in repeating the details of the report, only to point out however that the budget adopted by the conferees represents a considerable effort in bettering the quality of life for our military personnel.A good portion of the $666 million that was added to the President's request for military construction is to be spent on the most intractable problem we face, military housing; $101 million towards improving existing family housing units and $153 million towards new barracks and dormitories. Quality of life of our military personnel will be improved as a result.Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell my colleagues we are far from our goal of adequate housing. More spending is needed. As this bill goes forward, the condition of the military installation continues to deteriorate. We will be working on it.Though I support the bill, I want to express my continued concern that we are unable to assure a level playing field for small businesses. I have worked with the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Talent) on the CLASS proposal in the House passed authorization, because it improves the quality of life again for our service members and maintains a level playing field for small businesses to compete in the forwarding of household goods. Unfortunately, in the end, we were not able to get agreement on this. I can assure my colleagues we will work to resolve this issue in the best interests of our men and women in the Armed Forces.Regrettably, also the Charter and Build provision was not included. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Bateman) in particular for his steadfast resolution in this regard. The provision is good for America because it provides a means for the Navy to acquire the ships it needs to meet our strategic requirements and sustain the industrial base needed to produce them. The issue, I assure my colleagues, will be revisited until it is won.Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spence) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) for their leadership on this issue. I tell my colleagues that they can rest assured that I will continue to work with them on behalf of the strategic interests of the United States of America.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 417, the Energy Conservation Reauthorization Act of 1998.The legislation we are considering today is important to the State of Hawaii and the Nation. Hawaii and the Pacific territories have special needs during an energy emergency since we are isolated from the U.S. energy supply by more than 7,000 miles or one-quarter of the way around the globe. Oil accounts for more than 90 percent of Hawaii's energy and almost all of our oil is imported. In addition, we depend entirely on oil for our electricity generation.The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Louisiana and Texas is designed to help all consumers by dampening price rises and using markets to allocate oil efficiently through swaps or proximity delivery. Even so, time emergency deliveries are still problematic. Since all of our oil is delivered by tanker, we are very vulnerable to a cutoff of oil supplies. This bill gives Hawaii emergency access to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve so that we can submit a special bid for oil during a declared emergency.The oil price from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would equal the average of all SPR bids accepted by the Department of Energy. This bill also permits Hawaii to enter into an exchange agreement directing the SPR oil to be delivered to locations other than Hawaii.Another important provision in this bill is the biodiesel amendment. This provision should be important to all farmers and people concerned about the environment. Biodiesel is a renewable alternative fuel derived from vegetable oil or animal fat. It can be made from soybeans, canola, and even waste oils from fast food restaurants.Biodiesel fuel has many advantages. It is nontoxic. It can cut emissions of particulate matter and hydrocarbons in half. It can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Most important, biodiesel can reduce our national reliance on foreign oil.Biodiesel can be used directly in bus, truck, and marine vessel diesel engines. It does not require new refueling stations, new parts or expensive engine modifications.Islands are particularly suited to the manufacture of biodiesel fuels, as shown by Pacific Biodiesel. All islands have a difficult time disposing of waste products since landfill space is limited. On the islands of Hawaii, used cooking oils were unnecessarily taking up landfill space. Pacific Biodiesel currently processes 10,000 gallons of used cooking oil each month into premium biodiesel fuel. Many of the hotel buses in Hawaii now use biodiesel fuel that is produced by Pacific Biodiesel. Boats in the marinas are also using this high-quality fuel. The amendments to this bill will protect Hawaii from an energy crisis. They will also help our farmers and our environment. I urge my colleagues to support S. 417.",

    "title": "THE HAWAII FEDERAL MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PERCENTAGE ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 1999",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to re-introduce legislation to adjust the State of Hawaii's Federal medical assistance percentage [FMAP] rate. The intent of this bill is to more fairly reflect the ability of the state to bear its share of Medicaid payments. I am happy to have my colleague, Representative Patsy Mink, as a cosponsor of this measure. I am also pleased that our Hawaii Senators, Senator Daniel Akaka and Senator Daniel Inouye, have introduced similar legislation in the Senate, S. 264.The FMAP, or Federal share of the medical assistance expenditures under each state's Medicaid program, is determined annually by a formula that compares a state's average per capita income level with the national income average. States with a higher per capita income level are reimbursed a smaller share of their Medicaid costs. By law, the FMAP cannot be lower than 50 percent nor higher than 83 percent. In 1997, the FMAPs varied from 50 percent to 77.2 percent, with Hawaii receiving the lowest 50 percent rate.Alaska was another state receiving the lowest FMAP rate in 1997. However, in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, a provision increasing Alaska's FMAP rate to 59.8 percent for the next 3 years was included. Language in the Balanced Budget Act also mentioned that the same conditions warranting an increase in Alaska's FMAP rate applied to the State of Hawaii. The legislation that I am introducing today would conform Hawaii's rate with Alaska's. This bill would increase Hawaii's FMAP rate from 50 percent to 59.8 percent.The rationale for the FMAP change is quite simple. Hawaii's high cost of living skews the per capita income determining factor. Based on 1995 United States Census data, the cost of living in Honolulu is 83 percent higher than the average of the metropolitan areas. More recent studies have shown that for the state as a whole, the cost of living is more than one-third higher than the rest of the United States. In fact, Hawaii's Cost of Living Index ranks as the highest in the country. If per capita income is measured in real terms, the State of Hawaii ranks 47th at $19,755 compared to the national average of $24,231 (according to the twenty-first edition of ``The Federal Budget and the States,'' a joint study conducted by the Taubman Center for State and Local Government at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government and the office of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan). Thus, Hawaii's 50 percent FMAP rate is understated because cost of living factors are not considered. Per capita income is a poor measure of Hawaii's relative ability to bear the cost of Medicaid services.Some government programs take the high cost of living in Hawaii into account and funding is adjusted accordingly. These programs include Medicaid prospective payment rates, food stamp allocations, school lunch programs, housing insurance limits, Federal employee salaries, and military living expenses. These examples show a Federal recognition that the higher cost of living in noncontiguous states should be taken into account in fashioning government program policies. It is time for similar recognition of this factor in gauging Hawaii's ability to support its health care programs. It is time to pass my bill increasing Hawaii's FMAP from 50 percent to 59.8 percent.Setting a higher match rate as was done for Alaska would still leave Hawaii with a lower FMAP rate than a majority of the states. However, the higher rate would better recognize Hawaii's ability to pay its fair share of the costs of the Medicaid program and I am committed to achieving it.",

    "title": "NIKITIN TRIAL TO PROCEED IN RUSSIA",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge that the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Ganske) is here to begin his hour presentation, I believe, and I want to thank him for his courtesy in allowing me to claim this five minutes. I am sure that he will join with me and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) and others with respect to the very important subject that we wish to devote just a few minutes to today.Mr. Speaker, surely we can take some time at this particular juncture to devote attention, in this special order, to the difficulties that are now being experienced in what was the former Soviet Union, that is to say, in Russia.The Supreme Court in a Supreme Court session in Russia is being held on the 4th of February with respect to the Alexander Nikitin case. The case, Mr. Speaker, is important not only to Captain Nikitin and those who are interested in addressing issues of freedom in Russia, but it has profound consequences for all of us on the planet.Captain Nikitin has been the leading exponent of making clear what is happening with nuclear deterioration with the submarine fleet in the former Soviet Union. The degradation that is taking place in the environment there is something of concern, not only to the Russian people, but to all of us throughout the world. He is now being tried as a result of trying to bring this information forward in a more clear sense than it has been available before.I want to indicate for those Members and those who may become aware of the special orders today throughout the Nation that they can contact the Bellona Foundation, B-E-L-L-O-N-A, at P.O. Box 11835 in Washington D.C., 20008, and contact the Bellona Foundation if you want to aid and assist Captain Nikitin in Russia, if you want to become more aware of what is taking place with the deterioration of the nuclear submarines in the former Soviet Union.The Supreme Court is going to hear the appeal, as I indicated, on Thursday, February 4. I expect a verdict will be there the same day.For those of you who are not familiar with the case and the circumstances, let me give you a little background very quickly. The Council for Criminal Cases in the Supreme Court in Russia takes many former Soviet dissidents back to the times of the KGB. They have a special department there supervised by the KGB. They used to have one responsible for handling crimes against the state.I want it understood what is being said in Russia today is to express opinions and to discuss information that is otherwise available publicly, in public, in Russia today, is seen as a point of subversion and treason. That is what Captain Nikitin is being tried for.So what we are asking, Mr. Speaker, is that the Department of State pay particular interest and approach their counterparts in Moscow to indicate that the United States is very, very concerned about this situation, that we are watching it, that they are not going to be able to do this behind closed doors and get away with it. They are not used to public hearings in Russia and they are scared to go public on this.It is very, very important that Captain Nikitin's case be recognized by our Department of State as something that Members of this Congress are very, very concerned about, and I call on other Members to acquaint themselves with the circumstances.The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) is well aware of it, as I said. He is unable to be with us today to discuss the situation further. But I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, and I assure the other Members, this is not the last time that I will be on this floor, nor that individuals like the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) will be here.Let me conclude by indicating to that on a recent Congressional delegation trip to Russia, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) as the ranking Democrat on the Committee on Armed Services led a delegation of individuals from the Congress there, and we met with Captain Nikitin.We can provide you information, Mr. Speaker, on the case in more detail, but we just want to alert you and alert the State Department today that we expect to have this case front and center in the consciences of everyone who is concerned about the environmental degradation taking place in Russia today as a result of the deterioration of the nuclear submarines that are presently being mothballed.Mr. Speaker, I insert the following for the Record:Dr. Caraway: As you know the Supreme Court will hear the Nikitin appeal on Thursday. The verdict should be announced the same day. We will see then. Unfortunately, the hearing will take place behind closed doors, somewhat incomprehensible given that the hearing is not about the secrecy question, but about procedural issues. Yours, Thomas Jandl, Director, Bellona USA.",

    "title": "INVESTMENT IN WOMEN'S HEALTH ACT OF 1999",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to re-introduce the Investment in Women's Health Act. I am re-introducing this bill with Congresswoman Mary Bono and the support of the National Cervical Cancer Coalition, the College of American Pathologists, and the American Society of Clinical Pathologists.Last year, Dr. James Navin from Straub Hospital visited my office to alert me to a very serious inequity in the pap smear reimbursement rate in Hawaii. Health insurers in Hawaii had apparently taken a cue from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and lowered their pap smear reimbursement rate. Under this lower rate, the local laboratories would lose a significant amount of money on each screening. In fact, the reimbursement rate was low enough to force the laboratories to consider getting out of the business completely. Fortunately, the laboratories were able to convince the health insurers of the need for increased reimbursement. The laboratories were then compensated with a break even reimbursement rate for the pap smears.I soon found out that the low reimbursement rate is not only a problem in Hawaii, but across the entire United States. The low rate of Medicare reimbursement for pap smears has an impact on the rates paid by third party payers who peg their payments on what the government pays.To address the deficiency, I introduced legislation last year to raise HCFA's reimbursement rate for pap smears. Due to wide spread support, progress on this issue was made with the inclusion of report language in the Omnibus bill for fiscal year 1999 urging HCFA to use its existing statutory authority to raise the reimbursement rate by administrative action.Unfortunately, the reimbursement rate has not increased and the time table for any change is unclear. In order to rectify this situation, my legislation defines the date for an increase in the pap smear reimbursement rate and sets the rate at the national average for production costs. For women in Hawaii and the rest of the nation, this means we can assure their access to reliable and timely pap smear results.Everyone knows that pap smears save lives. With annual screening, the chance of developing cervical cancer can be reduced to less than 1%. Over the last 40 years, the incidence of invasive cervical cancer has decreased significantly due to early detection efforts. Still, an estimated 13,700 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in 1998, and 4,900 women will die of the disease. Screening for cervical cancer allows doctors to catch the disease in its early stages and save a life. A 70 percent decline in deaths due to cervical cancer in the last 50 years can be directly attributed to pap smears.An adequate pap smear reimbursement level demonstrates respect for the women and families who benefit from a timely and accurate annual pap smear. I am anxious to continue the work we have begun with HCFA and am counting on my colleagues support for the Investment in Women's Health Act of 1999.",

Serving side by side with active military personnel, fire fighters and other professional counterparts, some Guard and Reservists are exposed to hazardous and physically demanding duty as a routine part of their job. A well-earned and timely retirement should be a welcome relief from a job that requires youth, strength and virgo. Yet, for a select group of talented individuals, known as Dual Status Technicians, retirement eligibility is several years beyond that of their counterparts.Dual Status Technicians are held to the same physical and mental criteria as their military counterparts and the jobs they perform are likewise challenging. Although active military personnel, fire fighters and federal police can retire after 20 years of service, Technicians must work until age 55 with 30 years of service to receive full benefits. This bill gives Dual Status Technicians retirement eligibility equity with their counterparts.The Military Reserve (Dual Status) Technicians Retirement Equity Bill allows qualified National Guard and Reservists the option to retire under the same criteria as other professionals in similar challenging careers.",

And if this situation is not resolved, if we just continue on with the bombing so that the bombing becomes its own reason for being, then we will find ourselves in a situation in which the Congress, at a minimum, let alone the people of the United States, will find themselves in a position of having to passively stand by and let events get in the saddle and ride us.",

The bipartisan delegation prepared a resolution expressing the sense of Congress in supporting the recommendations of the Vienna meeting to bring about a fair, equitable and peaceful settlement in Yugoslavia. That draft resolution is attached. Additionally, I have attached a letter I sent to minority Leader Gephardt. I ask that you also support a bipartisan caucus so that the delegation can brief all members of Congress. Absent a bipartisan caucus, I ask your support for the delegation to brief the Armed Services Committee. This meeting with members of the Duma represents a singularly important step toward a negotiated solution. I seek your counsel and recommendations on how to best proceed. Sincerely, Neil Abercrombie, Member of Congress.Mr. Speaker, I wish to conclude my remarks by merely saying that the road to the resolution of this crisis is not in Belgrade and is not in Brussels, but is in fact in Moscow.The 11 of us, the bipartisan delegation which went to Vienna, had as its sole purpose the reaching out to the Members of the Russian Duma in an attempt to bring resolution to this crisis and bring it to a resolution at the earliest possible moment.Mr. Speaker, thank you for the time and I thank my colleagues for their generosity in providing it.",

    "title": "CONGRATULATIONS TO BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL RECIPIENT PRINCESS VICTORIA KA'IULANI ELEMENTARY SCHOOL",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Princess Victoria Ka'uilani Elementary School, which has earned the prestigious Blue Ribbon Schools Award from the U.S. Department of Education.The Blue Ribbon Schools Program identifies and gives national recognition to a diverse group of public and private schools that have been judged particularly effective in meeting local, state, and national goals. In being selected, Princess Ka'iulani Elementary School displayed the qualities of excellence that are necessary to prepare our young people for the challenges of the next century. The school demonstrates its strong leadership by providing high quality teaching, instilling policies and practices that ensure a safe environment conducive to learning, initiating strong parental and community involvement, and helping all students achieve to high standards.The awarding of Princess Victoria Ka'iulani Elementary School as a Blue Ribbon School is made even more special by the fact that this year marks the school's centennial anniversary. The school opened its doors on April 22, 1899 and was named for the beautiful Princess Victoria Ka'iulani. The name Ka'iulani means ``Child from Heaven.'' The students come from diverse cultures and various social backgrounds in the Kalihi-Palama neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawaii. And while the neighborhood is sometimes known for gangs and drug dealing, the school has a warm and friendly environment. The school definitely exudes the spirit of ``aloha'' and ``ohana'' (family). This nurturing atmosphere helps students to believe in themselves and offers an opportunity to learn and move forward.There are a variety of factors that contribute to the school's success. For example, at the beginning of each year, parents are given a student ready reference guide, a school profile, and a syllabus of the school's curriculum and activities. To further initiate parental involvement, a monthly parent bulletin is jointly authored by Title I, Parent-Community Networking Centers (PCNC), Primary School Adjustment Project (PSAP) and the Principal. Community involvement is also well established. Groups such as The Rotary Club of Metropolitan Honolulu, the USS Louisville, 516th Signal Brigade from the Fort Shafter Army Installation and the USS Chicago have contributed to the school's various campus beautification projects, providing access to the Internet and even assisting in classes and chaperoning field trips. Also, English Second Language Learners (ESLL) provides support to 101 students whose native language range from Vietnamese, Ilocano, Cantonese, Samoan, Tagalog, Visayan, Lao, Korean, Mandarin, Tongan, Micronesian and Fijian. In fact, students have continued to improve in Stanford Achievement Test (SAT) scores and due to a strong focus on literacy, reading levels have significantly increased over the past few years.Again, I wish to commend and congratulate the students, teachers, parents, administration, and staff of Princess Victoria Ka'iulani Elementary School for its strong efforts and proud achievement in receiving the Blue Ribbon Schools Award.",

    "text": "Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.I rise today in strong support of what the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer) has correctly characterized as a bipartisan amendment. I would think that we might even say that it is a nonpartisan amendment, to offer the thrift savings plan to our dedicated service members. As the senior Democrat on the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, I am extremely proud of the compensation package that we have put in this bill to help military personnel. This package addressed pay and retirement, as the gentleman from Indiana indicated, in a comprehensive fashion. May I add parenthetically, Madam Chairman, that I give full credit to the gentleman from Indiana for the really fabulous job that he, the staff and the other Members did with respect to making this truly comprehensive and far reaching.We were unable to include, as he indicated, a provision that we both viewed as critical not only to the military, but to the economic security of this Nation, the Thrift Savings Plan.We have the lowest personal savings rate since 1950. Over the past year, the personal savings rate, the amount of savings divided by disposable income expressed as a percentage in this country, has been less than 1 percent. The savings rate in the country is important because it represents the resources that can be used to create, sustain or expand the Nation's capital. Savings represent the potential for long-term future growth and increase the national standard of living, and we want our military to be able to participate in it.As a Nation, we should encourage all people to save, and, as an employer, the government is remiss if we do not offer that same opportunity to the military. Service members should be extended the same benefits as other Federal employees.Madam Chairman, as my colleagues know, we, as Members of Congress, are permitted to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan, and we think that, at a minimum, equity requires us to open up this process to members of the United States military. There are currently 1.4 million employees who do not have the employer-sponsored savings plan; that is the military. The military is the largest employer that does not offer a 401(k) plan. We do offer the benefit to Federal civilians, as I indicated, of the Thrift Savings Plan.Extending this plan to the military will have a salutary effect on the economy. Participation in the Thrift Savings Plan is 86.1 percent of the FERS employees and 61.2 percent of the CRS employees. If only 61.2 percent of the people in the military were to participate, there would be 848,000 participants. This amounts to a total contribution of additional savings of almost $1 billion over a 10-year period.It is past overdue then for us to extend this benefit to the military and allow them the benefit from and contribute to the growth of the economy.So I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment and reiterate, if I might, in this closing portion of these remarks that this is the product, this amendment is the product of a work effort which has characterized the Subcommittee on Military Personnel of the Committee on Armed Services from the beginning under the leadership of the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer) which was one of encouragement and cooperation not only extended to all Members, but extended to all members of the armed services who were invited to participate in our deliberations, and credit for that goes to the leadership of Mr. Buyer.Madam Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Maloney) to speak on the amendment.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Buyer-Abercrombie amendment to provide, in law, a provision for disability separation and retirement for service members with pre-existing conditions. This amendment is one of the en-bloc amendments.Current law does not include a standard to establish eligibility for disability retirement and separation based on medical conditions that existed prior to members entry into military service. Previously, disability retirement and separation based on pre-existing medical condition had been authorized in regulations after eight years of service.In 1979 the Department of Defense recommended to the Congress that disability compensation be extended to personnel with less than eight years of service, in order not to ``worsen . . . the competitive position of the armed forces in attracting and retaining the numbers and quality of members essential to the proper functioning of the forces'' in context of the ``All Volunteer'' service. Congress, under the Military Personnel and Compensation Amendments of 1980, approved this request. The DoD disability directive written at this time maintained the eight years length of service requirement only for pre-existing conditions. That policy was removed from the regulations in 1996 after a legal finding that there was no law to support the policy.Only in very rare instances is medical evidence provided that states unequivocally that military service played no part in the progression of the disease. In fact, such evidence has been presented for just a handful of diseases i.e. (Retinitis Pigmentosa, Huntington's Chorea) and the Services have found their hands tied by current DoD policy and legislation.This amendment offered by myself and Mr. Buyer would place in law a well-conceived and once well-executed policy and has the strong support of the Department of Defense. Adoption of this proposal would provide compensation to a small number of deserving people--perhaps 50 annually--that are afflicted by hereditary or congenital disease undetected at the time they joined the military.These affected service members are patriots, who after faithfully serving their country for at least eight years, are now told they are no longer fit for military duty because of a pre-existing condition. These men and women joined the military in good faith and it is that good faith that we must return to them. Mr. Buyer and I strongly urge our colleagues to support the amendment.The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. All time has expired.The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer).",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I can fully understand why people would want to try and save money but this kind of approach is, I think, unpardonable. I wish the gentleman had discussed the issue perhaps with myself, with the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Meek), with some others who are familiar with these programs. They perform an invaluable service, and to simply take the position that we are going to hack them in half or chop dollars out and let them try to fend afterwards as best they may is such a cavalier approach to cost cutting that it undermines, I think, entirely the thrust of any attempt to try and save money genuinely.These institutions are providing an intellectual foundation that gives us the opportunity, as Mr. Gejdenson indicated, to formulate policy in an intelligent way that saves the taxpayer dollars and allows us to carry foreign policy, in particular, forward in a manner that befits the strategic interests of this Nation.Mr. Chairman, this amendment is ill-timed. It is ill-founded and should be defeated.Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak against this amendment to H.R. 2415, the State Department authorization for FY2000. The amendment makes an ill advised 31 percent reduction in the bill's funding for the Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange between East and West, more commonly known as the East-West Center.The East-West Center has already suffered severe budget cuts during this decade. Further cuts would seriously compromise the national interests of the United States by weakening our full and constructive engagement in the Asia-Pacific area, which is emerging as the most dynamic region of the globe.The East-West Center was established by the Congress in 1960 to improve mutual understanding and cooperation among the governments and peoples of the Asia-Pacific region, including the United States. The Center helps prepare the United States for constructive involvement in Asia and the Pacific through education, dialogue, research and outreach. The Congress and Executive Branch agencies turn to the Center for advice and information.During the Center's 39 years of existence, more than 50,000 Americans, Asians and Pacific Islanders from over 60 nations and territories have participated in the East-West Center's educational, research and conference programs. Presidents, prime ministers, diplomats and distinguished scholars and statesmen from all parts of the region have used the Center as a forum to advance international cooperation. The Center has become one of the most highly respected institutions in the region.The friendly relations which exist today between the United States and countries of Asia and the Pacific are attributable in large measure to the work of the East-West Center.The 21st century will be the Pacific Century. Our relations with the nations of the region will determine America's role in the Pacific Century. Will we retain our position of leadership, or will we be relegated to the margins of the Pacific Century? The answer depends to a large extent on our commitment to understanding the region, demonstrating our involvement with its future, and nurturing our ties to its leaders of today and tomorrow.I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment and send a clear signal that U.S. interest in and commitment to the Asia-Pacific region remain undiminished.",

It is not an entity which the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink) or myself are associated with as Members of Congress per se. It is not an institution of the University of Hawaii or the State of Hawaii.I was there when it was founded 39 years ago when I was a student at the University of Hawaii. I am well acquainted with many of the alumni, Mr. Chairman, some 40,000 plus.We just finished today the conference report on the Committee on Armed Services. We have to fund our Armed Services because of our relationships to be prepared to defend the strategic interests of the United States and the Pacific Rim to the tune of billions and billions of dollars. We have 40,000 friends in Asia as a result of their experience at the East-West Center, which happens to be in Hawaii, which is the gateway for the United States of America and to all of Asia and South Asia and the Pacific Rim.I urge the Chair, and I urge the committee members who will be conference members as they deal with the Senate, to have an open mind based on the facts as I have outlined them and the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink) has outlined them and based on the fact that the East-West Center is very much in the strategic interests of the United States as a Federally chartered institution and as a catalyst for friendship throughout all of Asia for the United States of America.",

But in this particular instance, it seems to me that the overall course of events associated with the Department of Defense bill, the authorization bill that we have before us, merits our support.I will not recite it at great length other than to submit for the Record what we did with the Subcommittee on Military Personnel over and above the pay raise and the other issues that have been brought forward. I can say, I think, on behalf of the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer) as the chairman, that there are at least 17 specific issues associated with personnel measures that are a distinct advancement, some perhaps the best in 20 years. That is what is at stake with this bill.I want to mention just one in particular, the Thrift Savings Plan, that we have put forward. How can we expect to have our federal employees, which in effect our military are, be absent from the opportunity to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan. This bill provides for that opportunity. This takes 1.4 million families in the military, it takes 1.4 million people in the guard and reserves and their families, and makes them equal partners with the rest of us in the progress of this Nation as we turn the corner and the century.Mr. Speaker, I need go no further than to say that, as we go to East Timor, we will be calling up reservists to go to East Timor. We cannot conduct our deployments around the world without a guard and reserve component in conjunction with the act of military.So whether it is in East Timor, whether it is in Kosovo, whether it is in Bosnia, or whether it is in the United States, the armed services of the United States, in all their aspects, deserves our full support.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of the Lofgren-Conyers amendment to H.R. 2436, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. The bill is unfortunately flawed and needs to be modified because it fails to address the underlying issue--violence against women--pregnant or not. The majority of crimes against women occur during domestic violence and drunk driving incidents. I supported the Violence Against Women Act [VAWA] when it first became law in 1994. VAWA set up a national domestic violence hotline, grants for law enforcement, prosecution, and battered women shelters to combat violence and sexual assault. This Congress, I am a proud cosponsor of VAWA II which reauthorizes the original VAWA 1994 Act and has other provisions to further help protect women from violence. For example, the bill addresses sexual assault prevention and combating violence in the workplace.When we create laws that affect women, we cannot take the woman out of the equation which is what H.R. 2436 does. The woman is the victim of the crime and one of the best ways to protect a woman is to have VAWA II passed. I think everyone agrees that crimes against women are horrible. It's especially tragic when the woman is pregnant and that needs to be appropriately addressed which is why I am supporting the Lofgren-Conyers substitute, the Motherhood Protection Act of 1999.The Lofgren-Conyers substitute creates a federal criminal offense for harm to a pregnant woman and recognizes that the pregnant woman is the victim of a crime causing termination or harm during a pregnancy. The substitute provides for a maximum 20-year sentence for injury to a pregnant woman and a maximum life sentence for the termination of a pregnancy due to the assault. By focusing on the harm to the pregnant woman, it provides a deterrent against violence against women. I encourage my colleagues to support the Lofgren-Conyers substitute.",

    "title": "SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SHARK FINNING",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 189, relating to the practice of shark finning.There is no question that the practice is wasteful of a resource and should be discontinued. This issue has been on the agenda of the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council (WESPAC), which is responsible for managing our Western Pacific fisheries resources. WESPAC has been studying this issue, and I encourage them to continue to do so in order to compile the necessary data to take definitive action. In that regard, I would note that the Council has requested additional funds from NMFS during the past three years to do so, and as evidenced by our endorsement of this resolution today, there is a critical need for NMFS to comply with the request. I want to work closely with Representatives Eni Faleomavaega, Jim Saxton, Wayne Gilchrest, George Miller, Don Young and the Appropriations Committee to make sure there is adequate federal support for the broad and extensive responsibilities for which WESPAC is charged. The fisheries of the Western Pacific economic zones for which WESPAC is responsible comprises approximately forty-eight percent of the entire area NMFS regulates, but WESPAC receives only twelve percent of the total funding all the commissions receive. We must make certain that we give the Commission the tools, resources and support they need in order to credibly discharge their formidable responsibilities.Secondly, I would like to point out that even with enactment of this resolution or additional legislation amending the Magnuson-Stevens Act to ban shark finning, this is an international problem, and follow-up action must be initiated and undertaken in order to effectively end the practice internationally. Far more fins are unloaded in California ports, Hong Kong and other sites than in Hawaii, and the issue of transshipping of fins must also be addressed. If we are serious about ending finning, we need to act on several fronts.By citing the waste inherent in finning, the resolution raises the issue of full utilization of the products harvested from sharks. Fins should not be the only part of animal used and we need to develop refined products and markets in order to more fully make good use of shark parts. The resolution cites the waste inherent in finning, and yet there is an implicit level of utilization in other marine products. For example, to what extent is taking solely roe from fish or sea urchins wasteful? NMFS should address these utilization issues as it undertakes regulatory actions impacting shark catches.The last matter I would like to raise is that of compensation for lost income which will be sustained by Hawaii fishermen and industry. Shark fins generate significant revenue, and traditionally most of its goes directly to the crews of the fishing fleet. The resolution does not address lost compensation for crews, but I am pointing out the issue to indicate the complexity of the issue, and equity in addressing the economic consequences of fisheries regulatory decisions, based on precedents set by previous NMFS actions and decisions.Again, Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the resolution, as well as addressing the underlying and associated issues it raises.",

    "title": "CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET--FISCAL YEAR 2001",
    "text": "Mr. Chairman, as the ranking member of the House Subcommittee on Military Personnel of the Committee on Armed Services, I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered by my dear friend and colleague, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt).All Members who believe that we owe our military service members and their family members access to quality health care should support the substitute amendment being offered by the gentleman from South Carolina. The budget being proposed by the gentleman from South Carolina upholds the commitment to our armed forces personnel, particularly our military retirees who were promised health care in return for service to this great Nation.I support the Democratic budget amendment because it embodies the spirit of H.R. 3655, a bill I introduced along with the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton), the ranking member of the House Committee on Armed Services, and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor), to improve health care services for our Nation's service members, retirees, and their dependents.I regret deeply that the Committee on the Budget failed to incorporate necessary authority for the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, enabling us to complete that which should be a bipartisan task. I have high regard for the commitment of the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer) on these issues. Last year's success on efforts regarding pay, promotion, and benefits in the context of recruitment, retention, and retirement demonstrated what can be done when we set aside partisan considerations. I intend to continue to work with the chairman to accomplish these goals.But absent the Committee on the Budget preparing us for this, we have to go with the Democratic substitute in order to have our military retirees, our existing active duty members and their families receive the kind of health care that they have been promised. Our active duty troops and their families are having difficulty with access to military health care systems.The budget alternative before us today would allow for the elimination of copays for active duty personnel and their families who are in the TRICARE Prime program. The amendment also increases access to health care.Currently, families that receive care at a military treatment facility pay no co-payments. However, families that are not fortunate to live near a military treatment facility and use civilian health care providers in the TRICARE PRIME system must pay co-pays. This is not fair.The amendment also increases access to health care for our military family members who are often living in remote, rural areas by expanding the TRICARE Prime Remote program. These families are doing some of the hardest duty in the military. We should ensure that these families are cared for, which means that they should not have to drive hundreds of miles to receive health care for which they are entitled. Their ability to access health care services is just as important.Mr. Chairman, as our honored retired service members continue to age, their need for access to quality health care continues to grow. Today, thousands of our military retirees and their families are often going without the necessary medical care that they need and deserve because they have been shut out of the military health care system.As you may know, under the current program, military retirees who reach the age of 65 are forced out of the TRICARE Program and receive their health care services through Medicare. For many of these retirees who were promised access to military health care for their lifetime, this has been a broken promise of their faith. Many of these retirees and their families were led to believe that they would have access to military health care services if they made a career of serving their nation.Unfortunately, as the Department of Defense has drawn down and a number of military hospitals and clinics continue to close, space-available care remains elusive for most retirees. For these Medicare-eligible retirees, many of who are living on a fixed income, the prospects of costly medical care and high-priced pharmaceuticals is a scary proposition.The alternative budget proposal before us today would allow us to restore the necessary access to quality health care for military retirees over age 65 and their families. The amendment includes a provision that would incorporate the expansion of the TRICARE Senior Prime program, more commonly known as Medicare Subvention. This three-year demonstration program, which will be completed at the end of the year, has been well received by the over 65 retirees. Expansion of this program within the Department of Defense will help a number of military retirees who live near military treatment facilities.For those who may not live near a military treatment facility, the budget proposal includes funding to expand the current pharmacy benefits. Pharmacy costs for these individuals are often the largest share of health care spending. The average retiree over age 65 spends approximately $620 for prescriptions. For a retired enlisted noncommissioned officer and his family, pharmacy costs can sometimes be nearly 50 percent of their monthly income. Often these families are placed in a difficult and traumatic position of choosing between whether to purchase their prescription drugs or food on their table.The substitute amendment before us today will improve access to the TRICARE program and enhance access to care for military retirees. I hope that my colleagues will support the Spratt budget amendment and uphold our moral obligation to provide for the health care of our nation's Armed Forces.",

    "title": "EQUAL PAY DAY RESOLUTION",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a resolution with Representative Constance Morella to recognize the significance of May 11th as Equal Pay Day. May 11, 2000, is the day when women's wages for the period beginning January 1, 1999, will equal the amount earned by a man during calendar year 1999. Equal Pay Day represents the 17 months that the average woman must work to earn the same amount the average man earns in just 12 months. It is calculated according to the U.S. Census Bureau data showing a 27% wage gap in 1998.While women's participation in the labor market has increased dramatically over the last few decades, their pay has not. Women now comprise 46% of all workers, up from 33% in 1960. During this same period, federal legislation was enacted with the intent of mitigating labor market discrimination against women and others.This Equal Pay Act, mandated equal pay for men and women employed in the same or substantially same jobs in a company.The Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibited discrimination in employment and compensation against women and other protested classes of workers.Executive Order 11246 also forbade labor market discrimination and required affirmative action for protested classes of workers employed by federal contractors and subcontractors.Yes, these measures have given today's working women opportunities their mothers never had. Women now work in many different fields, each requiring different skills and experience and paying different wages. However, opening doors for working women has not closed the door on pay discrimination. Women continue to earn less than men for comparable work. U.S. Census data from 1998 shows that women earn only 73 cents for every dollar earned by men.Women get paid less because employers still discriminate in several ways.(1) Jobs usually held by women pay less than jobs traditionally held by men--even if they require the same education, skills and responsibilities.For example, stock and inventory clerks, who are mostly men, earn about $470 a week. General office clerks, on the other hand, are mostly women and they earn only $361 a week.(2) Women don't have equal job opportunities. A newly hired woman may get a lower-paying assignment than a man starting work at the same time for the same employer. That first job starts her career path and can lead to a lifetime of lower pay.(3) Women don't have an equal chance at promotions, training and apprenticeships. Because all these opportunities affect pay, women don't move up the earnings ladder as men do.Equal pay is a problem for all working women.Women lawyers--median weekly earnings are nearly $300 less than those of male attorneys--and women secretaries--who receive about $100 a week less than male clericals;Women doctors--median earnings are more than $500 less each week than men's earnings--and the 95 percent of nurses who are women but earn $30 less each week than the 5 percent of nurses who are men;Women professors--median pay is $170 less each week than men's pay--and women elementary school teachers--receive $70 less a week than men;Women food service supervisors--paid about $60 less each week than men in the same job--and waitresses--weekly earnings are $50 less than waiters' earnings. (AFL-CIO data)Every penny lost to wage inequity means fewer dollars available for women to spend on food, rent, health care, and education. So, unequal pay doesn't just affect women, it affects our entire economy. A working lifetime of diminished earnings costs the average working woman an estimated $250,000 in lost wages. Lower lifetime earnings translates into lower pension, retirement benefits and savings. As a result, women are more likely to enter retirement in poverty.By calling attention to these facts, our Equal Pay Day Resolution can heighten awareness and help create a climate in which pay discrimination can be eliminated and every person paid according to his or her worth. I am introducing this bill with 23 original cosponsors to demonstrate strong support in the U.S. House of Representatives for change across the country.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I wish to express my support for H.R. 3244, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.Trafficking in human beings is an evil which many assume was abolished long ago. Sadly, this is not the case. Human trafficking remains one of the worst human rights violations of the contemporary world. Its victims are typically the poorest, the most vulnerable and most disadvantaged. Trafficking is global in scope, fed by poverty, lawlessness, dictatorship and indifference. Each year, more than one million people, mostly women and children, are lured or forced into slavery. Traffickers buy young girls from relatives, kidnap children from their homes or lure women with false promises of legitimate employment. Traffickers use rape, starvation, torture, extreme physical brutality and psychological abuse to force victims to work in horrible conditions as prostitutes, in sweatshops or domestic servitude. Every American should be concerned and ashamed that many of these victims--perhaps numbering in the thousands--are trafficked into the United States each year.It is clear that we need stronger laws to deter trafficking. We especially need to impose disincentives to deter the international criminal rings which profit from the practice. H.R. 3244 includes these disincentives and other provisions to deter and punish traffickers by:Establishing new criminal provisions and increasing criminal and other penalties for traffickers;Establishing initiatives to prevent trafficking by educating potential victims and improving their economic conditions to decrease the lure of traffickers;Authorizing assistance for countries where victims originate to help them;Authorizing a new visa for trafficking victims and providing certain federal benefits for such victims to create a safe haven so that victims will escape their conditions and help prosecute the traffickers;Cutting off non-humanitarian assistance to countries that do not effectively combat trafficking, while providing the President a national interest waiver; andFocusing U.S. Government efforts in order to create greater interagency coordination to combat this problem.Trafficking in human beings is a shameful blot on the contemporary world. It imposes unspeakable hardship and cruelty on millions of people. I support the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, because it provides a legal framework to attack this contemporary evil. This measure deserves our support, because it affirms our adherence to universally accepted norms of human rights and it gives concrete expression to our will to defend and extend those rights.",

Today is the day when women's wages for the period beginning January 1, 1999, will equal the amount earned by a man during calendar year 1999.Since the passage of landmark legislation like the Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act, women's participation in the labor market has increased dramatically. Unfortunately, their pay has not.Women continue to earn less than men for comparable work. U.S. Census data from 1998 shows that women earn only 73 cents for every dollar earned by men.Equal pay is a problem for all working women. For example, the 95 percent of nurses who are women earn $30 less each week than the 5 percent of nurses who are men.Unequal pay doesn't just affect women, it affects our entire economy.I had hoped that I would be able to bring forward the resolution that Representative Morella and I introduced recognizing Equal Pay Day. Unfortunately, the Republican Leadership in the House refuses to acknowledge the significant effects of unequal pay on working women and their families.This Congress can do more than rest on the laurels of equal pay legislation that passed over 30 years ago. I urge all Members of Congress to commemorate Equal Pay Day. Let women in your district know that you will pursue the passage of equal pay legislation in the 106th Congress.",

But the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 is very urgent for the United States. I strongly urge my colleagues on the Committee on Rules to reconsider their decision on many amendments that do not appear before the House today.The bill before us builds upon last year's achievements and continues our efforts to improve the quality of life for our military personnel retirees and their families. I am particularly pleased that the bill includes several provisions, which I support, to improve the military health care system, particularly for our Medicare-eligible retirees and their families.This year, the Year of Health Care, we have made significant improvements in the military health care system in response to concerns raised by service members, retirees, and their families. The health care provisions of this bill will greatly improve their quality of life, particularly for Medicare-eligible retirees and their dependents.The TRICARE Senior Pharmacy Program will restore access to the National Mail Order Pharmacy, the network retail pharmacies, and the out-of-network pharmacies. It is a major step towards improving health care for our Medicare-eligible retirees. We have improved access to TRICARE. We have reduced and streamlined the administrative costs, and we are using the savings to improve health care benefits for our military personnel, retirees and their families.I am particularly pleased that this bill includes provisions which we have supported on our side of the aisle, and I am particularly pleased to have been able to work with the gentleman from Indiana (Chairman Buyer) to see that everything has been included.It includes improvements to pay, it reduces out-of-pocket housing costs for service members, and provides funding for the Military Thrift Savings Plan. These provisions help us build upon our achievements of last year, which was the Year of the Troops.Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spence), the chairman, and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton), the ranking member of the Committee on Armed Services, for their leadership in producing a bipartisan bill that will improve the lives of our service members.I particularly want to commend again the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer) for working with me and other members on the committee to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the quality of life that they deserve.",

The agreement addresses the concerns of American citizens of Vieques and assures that our training needs are met. This agreement was reached not with the protestors but with the lawful authorities in Puerto Rico.Because of the agreement, the Federal and local government enforcement officers removed the demonstrators blocking access to the training facility and the Navy is conducting training on Vieques as we speak.Now last week, the Committee on Armed Services approved language that disrupts this carefully-crafted agreement and I want to discourage my colleagues from further jeopardizing the outcome they wish to obtain regarding the Navy's presence in Vieques.Disruption would require the Vieques issue to go back to the drawing board. We should respect the hard work that has been done, and the national security interests representing the people of Vieques will be served.Further, this effort by the Congress could very well end up backfiring. Disruption of the process will inevitably bring negative consequences for the Navy, and in that ill-fated effort it kills the possibility of building a relationship between the Navy and the people of Vieques.The resolution is best accomplished by moving forward with the agreement. The Skelton amendment takes the first step towards living up to the negotiated agreement. I urge all my colleagues, particularly those on the Committee on Armed Services, to support the agreement reached by the Department of Defense and the Governor and support the Skelton amendment.",

    "title": "NATIVE HAWAIIAN HOUSING",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I express my support for the inclusion of the Hawaiian Homelands Homeownership Act, in the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act, H.R. 1776. I appreciate the leadership of Representative Rick Lazio on this bill. The Native Hawaiian housing provisions that were a part of the manager's amendment are similar to legislation that I introduced in the 105th Congress. I am hopeful that we can continue to work together to assure these important initiatives are signed by President Clinton this year.The purpose of the Hawaiian Homelands Homeownership Act is to allow access to federal housing assistance programs to Native Hawaiians who are eligible to reside on Hawaiian Home Lands but do not qualify for private mortgage loans.Although Federal housing assistance programs in Hawaii have been administered on a racially neutral basis, Native Hawaiians continue to have the greatest unmet need for housing and the highest rates of overcrowding in the United States. Forty-nine percent of Native Hawaiians experience housing problems as compared to 44 percent for American Indian and Alaska Native households and 27 percent for all other households in the United States.These troubling statistics are not recent news. In 1920, Congress enacted the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act to address Congressional findings that Native Hawaiians were a landless and distressed population. Under the Act, approximately 200,000 acres of public land that had been ceded to the United States in what was then the Territory of Hawaii would be set aside for the native people of Hawaii.When Hawaii was admitted into the Union of States in 1959, title to the 200,000 acres of land was transferred to the State of Hawaii with the requirement that the lands be held in public trust for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians. The Hawaii Admissions Act also required that the Hawaii State Constitution provide for the assumption of a trust responsibility for the lands. The lands are now administered by a State agency, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act authorized general leases of land set aside under the Act. Congress anticipated that revenues derived from general leases would be sufficient to develop the necessary infrastructure and housing on the home lands. However, general lease revenue has not proven sufficient to address infrastructure and housing needs. There are approximately 60,000 Native Hawaiians who are eligible to lease and reside on the home lands. However, due to the lack of resources to develop infrastructure (roads, access to water and sewer and electricity), hundreds of Native Hawaiians have been put on a waiting list and died before receiving an assignment of home lands.In 1995, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands published a Beneficiary Needs Study as a result of research conducted by an independent research group. This study found that among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs of those eligible to reside on the Hawaiian home lands are the most severe--with 95 percent of home lands applicants (16,000) in need of housing. Additionally, one-half of those applicant households face overcrowding and one-third pay more than 30 percent of their income for shelter.The Hawaiian Homelands Homeownership Act will help move Hawaiians into their own homes. People have spent decades on the Hawaiian waiting list. One of the obstacles that has kept people from getting homesteads has been their inability to qualify for home lands. Once this bill becomes law, they'll have access to the loans they need to attain the dream of homeownership.",

    "title": "INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE EXTENDED PAYMENT OF ESTATE TAX FOR ESTATES WITH CLOSELY HELD BUSINESSES",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, Mrs. McCarthy from New York joins me today in introducing a bill to provide estate tax relief for closely held, family-owned businesses. Both Mrs. McCarthy and I support repeal of the estate tax and we have co-sponsored legislation in this Congress, H.R. 8, to effect repeal. The Ways and Means Committee will soon mark up H.R. 8 and report the measure for floor action.The estate tax threatens the survival of family businesses. Mrs. McCarthy has heard this in her Small Business Committee, just as I have heard from my constituents. Economists and tax experts confirm that the estate tax creates a true impediment in passing the family business to the next generation. The Congressional Budget Resolution, however, prevents an immediate repeal of the estate tax, and the anticipated committee recommendation will provide rate reduction with a gradual, extended phase down of the tax.I support that recommendation as do many of my colleagues. But family-owned businesses need immediate relief if they are to survive as family enterprises. Any business owner who dies during that phase-down period, will face the problem of having to sell the business to pay the tax. Active, family-owned businesses are inherently illiquid. The owners have invested most, if not all, of their assets in the business. Where a business constitutes the major part of a person's estate, the estate must sell off the business assets, or in many cases the business itself, to pay the federal estate tax within 9 months of the owner's death.Now, sale of the business or sale of the business assets is hard to complete within 9 months. The seller is not going to get the full value of the property in a forced sale. Instead of this losing proposition, an aging parent while still living will often sell the family business even though the children want to retain the enterprise.Even the tax scholars, who argue in favor of the estate tax, agree that family businesses face a true hardship to raise cash for the estate tax. They recommend that family businesses should have an extended period to pay off the tax so that the business will not have to be sold.Trying to deal with this problem, Congress in 1958 and again in 1976 enacted the deferral and installment payment provisions in current law. Under section 6166 of the tax code, an executor of an estate can elect to defer payment of the federal estate tax for 4 years and pay the tax in annual installments over the next 10 years. The decedent's estate must pay the Treasury a discounted rate of interest on the amount of deferred tax outstanding. The 4-year deferral and 10-year installment payment apply as to the estate tax on a closely held business.This relief covers ownership of a sole proprietorship, a corporation, or a partnership. But the relief is restricted under an obsolete definition of eligibility. Back in 1948, the tax code defined a small business as having 10 or less shareholders or owners for Subchapter S treatment. In the estate tax area, relief was geared to the same definition under Subchapter S. In 1976, when Congress re-visited the estate tax, it extended the deferral and installment payment relief to businesses with 15 or less owners in keeping with the revised Subchapter S definition of small business. In 1996, Congress modified the definition of a small business under Subchapter S to mean a business with less than 75 owners, but Congress failed to make the comparable change in the estate tax. Consequently estate tax relief for closely held businesses is now based on an antiquated definition.The proposal in the bill Mrs. McCarthy and I are introducing, raises the number of permissible shareholders and partners in a qualifying business from 15 to 75 for purposes of section 6166 relief. Again, our proposal is consistent with the definition of a small business corporation in section 1361 of the tax code. Congress, in the Small Business Jobs Protection Act of 1996, had raised the permissible number of shareholders from 35 to 75 for small business corporations under section 1361, and Congress in that same bill should have made the same change for estate tax relief back in 1996.As I stated earlier, owners of closely held, family businesses have to sell their business to meet their estate tax liability. The proposed relief gives family-owned businesses as well as other closely held businesses, additional time to pay the tax. Business earnings could then be used to pay the decedent's estate tax liability without having to sell business assets or the business itself. The children could continue to own and run the family business. I commend this bill to my colleagues.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, for 1 minute, can we just set aside all of this rhetorical, divisive language about left and right and who wants to stiff-arm 2 percent or 98 percent. That is not what this is about. The whole basis of this law has changed. We have to recognize that there are middle-income businesses, small businesses all throughout this country that would benefit from a change; and we all know that there is an objection with respect to whether or not the megawealthy may or may not be able to have more advantages than they have right now.This is the first step in a legislative process, and we can be thankful to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Tanner) and the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Dunn) and to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) and to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Archer), who are excellent legislators. Everyone knows that. They will put together a package that in the end is going to achieve tax equity and fairness for the overwhelming majority of Americans who deserve it, that is going to help preserve jobs and that is going to see to it that the small businesses throughout this country and the jobs that they create are going to be preserved and protected.Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8. it is pro-jobs and pro-tax fairness, and the House should pass the bill by a wide majority.As many of you know, I have been a long time supporter of working people and their interests. It is from those perspectives that I come here today to support H.R. 8 and urge the reform of the federal estate tax law.A permanent federal estate tax was first enacted in 1916. there was clearly a revenue raising need as a result of the U.S. entering World War I. But there were also philosophical and political motives in that great fortunes had been amassed during the industrial revolution, and there was felt to be a progressive public policy objective of stopping the perpetuation and transmission of the great control that inherently accompanied vast wealth and estates.At the time, there was compelling and legitimate concern that vast fortunes, estates and trust were limiting access to capital by the emerging middle-class entrepreneurs.We are now, however, in the 21st Century. Our economy, society and means of production have radically changed. We are no longer primarily an agrarian economy, and in many ways we may be nearing the end of heavy industry phase of our economic development. The outdated laws governing industry, commerce and society of the early 20th Century must be changed to reflect the realities of the year 2000 and beyond.Capital remains a key component of business formulation and development. It is not, however, being concentrated by entities subject to the estate tax as in 1916.Irrelevant and antiquated 19th and early 20th Century laws may be a hindrance to how our society now functions. Federal estate and gift tax law fits that category.My perspective on the issue is that current law diminishes the capability of small businesses, and the jobs associated with them, to continue after the death of an owner or owners. Some studies (Heritage Foundation) have indicated that as many as 145,000 additional new jobs could be created by repeal of the estate tax law. As much as $11.0 billion in additional economic output could result. The preservation and expansion of smaller, family businesses will protect jobs, and generate and expand the number of new jobs.For example, I represent the State of Hawaii, a state dominated by small businesses. Plantation agriculture has virtually ended and with the demise and economic dislocation associated with economic change, we are working hard to diversify Hawaii agriculture. This means many more smaller scale farmers growing specialty and niche crops instead of millions of tons of sugar. The middle class in Hawaii has developed from small business origins, and we now have great hope that a new generation of entrepreneurs will help sustain the economy through the new farming opportunities available for the first time in generations. I want to help preserve and develop those elements in Hawaii and in the American economy and society that generate millions of jobs.Regarding tax fairness, an equally compelling case is made that the wealthiest do not pay their fair share of estate taxes. The Tax Code has deliberately been riddled with exemptions and exceptions that are ruthlessly and thoroughly exploited by tax attorneys specializing in the preservation of inherited wealth. There is an entire body of tax law devoted to estate and gift tax avoidance and minimalization.Tax attorneys, I assure you, are talented and hard-working. The result is the majority of estates paying estate taxes are valued at $5.0 million and less. These are not the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Carnegies and J.P. Morgan robber barons the 1916 law was enacted to curb. Huge fortunes have for generations been sheltered with sophisticated, complex tax machinations. It is family farm and small businesses owners who are being penalized when trying to pass down assets to new generations to keep middle-class businesses in operation and generating employment. I can assure you I know of no small businesses in Kaneohe, Makiki, Waianae or Mililani, Hawaii that resort to multi-generation skipping trusts in order to keep a bakery or a delivery service in operation.Lastly, there is a human element in this debate that must be noted. One of my constituents, Steve Lee, is an estate attorney and planner in Honolulu. Mr. Lee's father inherited a few apartments from his parents some time ago. Mr. Lee's grandparents worked hard for years, acquiring the apartments as a means of assuring retirement income. Now his father is spending hours trying to figure our how to keep the property intact to pass it along to Mr. Lee and his brother. The Lees are middle-income in Hawaii. The value of real property acquired years ago, however, has been greatly inflated and the Lee brothers will face the need to liquidate at least part of the property in order to pay estate taxes in 9 months. The Lees justifiably feel they are being penalized for having kept their property intact within their family.Mr. Speaker, our current estate tax fails to meet the goals we expect. It is overly complex to the point of being arcane, the burden on those upon whom it falls is unfair and inefficient.Passing H.R. 8 today is the first major step. As we move through the legislative process, however, we will also seriously consider proposals that would provide interim, transitional relief. We will seriously consider any inequities that total elimination might engender. We will address Presidential objections. We can forge a bill acceptable to all who want tax equity.Consequently, I look on H.R. 8 as both tax fairness, and pro-jobs and I am pleased to be associated with John Tanner, Jennifer Dunn, Bill Archer, Eva Clayton and others in helping move estate tax reform legislation through Congress.I urge the House to pass the bill, and bring more fairness to the Tax Code.",

Those trustees are no longer in place. The argument that he has had with the Bishop Estate no longer applies. Not one single penny, as he well knows, goes to the Bishop Estate.Why the gentleman from Ohio has this obsession to come to Hawaii, why he has the time to leave his district in Ohio and try to come to the floor of this House to act on behalf of Hawaiian children, I do not know. But I do know that his characterization to my colleagues is something that I take great offense at, because not one penny for these children is going to either those trustees or into that estate.The people who are handling the funds that my colleagues have put forward in this bill are the University of Hawaii at Hilo, the Leeward Community College, the Maui Community College, the Kauai Community College, the Hawaii Community College, and four Hawaiian nonprofit organizations, none of whom have anything to do with the Bishop Estate.Now, if my colleagues want to make this into a Republican versus Democratic issue, I most emphatically plead with them, do not do this. This is an educational issue that everyone in every district here can relate to on the basis of what is good for the children of one's district.This is not a partisan issue unless the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner) is able to make it that and unless he is able to convince my colleagues against the evidence that this has something to do with the estate with which he has had an argument in the past.Every issue raised by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner) with respect to the estate has been addressed. Every single issue now is moot.So I plead with all the Members, Democrat or Republican here, to trust the judgment in this instance of Democrats and Republicans alike, leaders on both sides, and a plea from me and the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink) that my colleagues allow us, as we do for any Member in this House, to trust us as we trust them to address the particular circumstances in their districts that require congressional attention.I ask the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner) not to make this an issue that would divide this House along partisan lines and to recognize that his arguments have been met, his arguments have been addressed.Kamehameha Schools assists with the development of the needs assessment and targets programming to these needs. From the 1999 report, the most severe needs continue to be school readiness, basic skills, high school completion, and college enrollment and completion. Efforts to address these needs must begin with the very young, and it must integrate the language, culture, and values of the Native Hawaiian people.In May 1999, the courts appointed a new Board of Trustees for the Bishop Estate. The interim trustees have moved swiftly to approve new policies and initiatives which have already changed the direction of Kam Schools in very constructive ways. The Board has held many town meetings to undertake strategic planning with all stakeholders.The direction of Kam Schools for the next 10 or 15 years will spend more on education and try to reach more Hawaiians and form more community partnerships. Another major change--giving the Hawaiian community more of a say in how the trust is run--has already begun with the strategic planning process. The draft was formed from more than 3,000 comments and suggestions the estate has solicited from the public since August. Kam Schools currently serves 961 preschool age children, 1,000 elementary school students on three islands, and 2,482 students attending high school on Oahu. They plan to increase the education spending from $100 million annually to $159 million in the next budget.Since May 1999, the following changes have occurred:Reorganized the Education Group, so all instructional and support programs report directly to the President;Began leveraging of Kamehameha's resources through partnerships to expand programs;Developed a K-3 reading program with DOE for DOE classrooms;Expanded Pre-schools for three-year oldsApproved parenting program focusing on infants and toddlers.The NHEA was enacted in 1988. Its objective is to raise the educational status of Native Hawaiians (whose needs are documented below) through the provision of supplemental programs and services for curriculum development, pre-school education, gifted and talented programs, special education initiatives, and the provision of higher education. The Act was amended in 1994 and expanded to include the establishment of community-based learning center, a curriculum development and teacher training component, and the establishment of a statewide Native Hawaiian Education Council and individual island councils.(Sec. 9204) Native Hawaiian Education Council and Island Councils(Sec. 9205) Native Hawaiian Family-Based Education Centers(Sec. 9206) Native Hawaiian Higher Education Program(Sec. 9207) Native Hawaiian Gifted and Talented Program(Sec. 9208) Native Hawaiian Special Education Program(Sec. 9209) Native Hawaiian Curriculum Development, Teacher Training, and Recruitment Program(Sec. 9210) Native Hawaiian Community-Based Education Learning Centers(Other grantees include the University of Hawaii at Hilo, Leeward Community College, Maui Community College, Kauai Community College, Hawaii Community College, Pihana Na Mamo, Alu Like, Inc., Pulama I Na Keiki, Aha Punana Leo)(1) Native Hawaiian Higher Education Program$1.036 million program funding--last year served 91 students.provide financial assistance and direction to Native Hawaiian students seeking postsecondary education--also requires a community service commitment(2) Kamehameha Talent Search$303,201 program funding--competitively granted--last year served 800 public schools studentsassist students who may be first in family to graduate from a secondary school to enroll in postsecondary educational programs$882,000 program funding--last year served 12,369 individualsestablish Safe and Drug Free Schools to reduce violence and substance abuseDuring the October 1999 markup of a section of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization, Representative Boehner offered his amendment to repeal the program. He stated:His comments would focus on Bishop Estate, its mission, its history of scandal, its budget, and potential for success with the recent reformsHe said there are 15,000 Native Hawaiian children in Hawaii--Patsy corrected him with Census data in her testimony, stating that there are actually 47,282.He said Bishop Estate was worth $10 billion and they own 10% of Goldman Sachs, numerous Hawaii hotels, Las Vegas casinos, and shopping centers. Kamehameha Schools budget data reflects a net worth closer to $5 billion.He said that the former trustees were involved in kickback schemes, mail fraud, drug use, and improper credit card use, but their biggest fault was their $1 million annual compensation. He also mentioned the continuing probe of the estate's activities by the IRS and the State courts.He said that there are 3,200 students in Kamehameha Schools and that only one-eighth of those that apply are accepted. Patsy corrected him that there are actually 5,000 children attending Kam Schools--my statistics show that the number is 4,444 kids.He also made a point that the Estate should try using their interest income on educating Native Hawaiian children. That would raise the amount they spend by $400 million annually.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Army for 225 years of service to our Nation, and I would like to have it recorded that I would like to join in with my chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer), with his words. I thought they were very eloquent and to the point, and I am happy indeed to be able to associate myself with them.The United States Army created the year before the Declaration of Independence was signed, has for over 200 years courageously fought this Nation's wars and ensured peace and prosperity. The sacrifices of our men and women in uniform have brought freedom, not just for our country, but also for many others throughout the world.Particularly, in my own State of Hawaii, the Army has a proud history. On December 7, 1941, the soldiers of the 25 Infantry Division had the distinction of being the first Army soldiers to see combat in World War II when they fired on Japanese aircraft strafing Schofield Barracks during the attack on Pearl Harbor.After the attack, the 25th quickly set up its defensive positions to protect Honolulu and Pearl Harbor against possible Japanese attack.I must also mention the heroism during World War II of the legendary 442nd Regimental Combat Team and the 100th Infantry Battalion. Comprised of Asian-Americans, these two units performed with great valor and courage during the Europe campaign. Already, two of the most highly decorated units in the Army, the bravery of these soldiers will again be recognized when President Clinton on June 21 awards 19 medals of honor later this month for their courage during World War II.While the Army can justifiably be proud of its history, it is also fearlessly looking to the future. The Army is demonstrating remarkable flexibility by transforming itself in a new fighting force that will be able to win on the battlefield tomorrow, whether that means urban combat in remote parts of the world or peacekeeping in a war-ravaged country.The capability the Army provides continues to be an important and integral part of our ability to ensure the peace and security of our Nation. But the commitment of our military personnel does not come without peril and price. Duty often calls for prolonged periods away from family and home.Today, Mr. Speaker, we recognize the sacrifice of those whose dedication and devotion to duty ensure the blessings of freedom every day.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Hefley) for yielding.Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2722, which is before the House today authorizing the Medal of Honor for James K. Okubo, Ed. W. Freeman, and Andrew J. Smith for the heroic actions as outlined by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Hefley).These three individuals are highly deserving of this award for their conspicuous bravery under fire in the defense of our great nation.I am particularly pleased that this legislation is the culmination of an exhaustive effort to recognize James K. Okubo for his valor during World War II. Mr. Okubo, a Japanese-American, originally from Washington State, like hundreds of others was sent to an internment camp in California at the outset of World War II. Despite being subjected to this shameful treatment, he never wavered in his patriotism and dedication to this country.James Okubo entered the Army and was assigned as a medic in the legendary 442nd Regimental Combat Team. In October of 1944, Technician Okubo and his unit were tasked with the rescue of the ``Lost Battalion'' from Texas. The ``Lost Battalion'' was surrounded by German forces and threatened with annihilation.During a 2 day period of heavy machine gun fire, mortar and artillery fire, Technician Okubo provided first-aid to 25 fellow soldiers wounded in the battle. On two occasions he crawled within yards of enemy lines to evacuate wounded comrades. Later during the battle he ran 75 yards through withering machine gun fire directed at him and evacuated a seriously wounded crewman from a burning tank.For his heroism displayed during these intense combat situations, Technician Okubo was recommended for the Medal of Honor. I think it is important to note that, Mr. Speaker, he was recommended at that time for the Medal of Honor. However, the award was downgraded with the explanation that since he was a medic, Technician Okubo was not eligible for any award higher than the Silver Star.Sadly, Mr. Okubo passed away in 1967 without ever receiving the proper recognition he rightly deserves. However, we now have the opportunity to correct this injustice. Mr. Okubo's case has recently been reviewed, as the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Hefley) indicated, by the Department of the Army under Section 1130 of Title X. After a thorough review of the facts of the case, the Army determined that Mr. Okubo in fact deserves to be awarded the Medal of Honor recommended for him for his valor during World War II.On June 21, the President will be recognizing 12 members of Mr. Okubo's former unit, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. These individuals have also earned the Nation's highest award, the Medal of Honor.I strongly urge the House to join our colleagues in the Senate and pass S. 2722, so that James K. Okubo can be honored with his comrades on this momentous occasion.Mr. Speaker, may I conclude and thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Hefley) again personally on this floor for not only his interest, but his dedication, and thank in particular Mike Higgins and Phil Grone, Ashley Godwin and Deborah Watta for making it possible for the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Hefley) and myself to appear on the floor in such an expeditious manner. They have done a terrific job with this, Mr. Speaker, and I am very grateful. I thank the gentleman for yielding.",

It is her intent that this funding be used to support the Hawaii Longline Fisheries Observer Program, a threatened program absolutely essential to fisheries in the Pacific. The observer program is used to ensure that the longlining industry in the Pacific is not capturing, through incidental take, rare and endangered species such as leatherback sea turtles. NMFS has stated that it is mandatory that the observer program be in place to monitor the longline fishery, yet has cut this program from 13 to 2 people because of budget shortfalls. A proposed lawsuit threatens to close down the fishery entirely without observers, and we can not allow this to happen. We need to get the observers back on the boats where they belong! The Western Pacific Fishery Management Council has been supportive of the observer program as it provides important data needed for effective management. It is my understanding that the proposed budget includes funding for other observer programs, but that the Hawaiian longline observer program is sorely neglected. I urge support of this program by Congress in order to correct this oversight as a matter of fairness to fisheries in the Pacific.",

    "title": "AMERICAN SHIPBUILDERS CRUISE INTO A NEW MILLENNIUM",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker. On June 30, 2000, Litton Ingalls Shipbuilding cut steel on the first cruise ship to be built in the United States in nearly 45 years. This historic event marks another milestone in the U.S.-flag Cruise Ship Pilot Project, enacted as part of the MARITECH program in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 1998, and represents America's re-entry into the burgeoning cruise travel market.People have been saying for years that America cannot build ships competitively on the world market. The construction of the two cruise ships for American Classic Voyages Co. at Litton Ingalls Shipbuilding demonstrates that America can build ships competitively on the world market. At a fixed price of $440 million a piece, the ships are only slightly above the price being charged for cruise ship construction in European yards, where nearly all new cruise ships are built. The price of the America ships would be even more competitive in the world market if the worldwide ship construction subsidies were eliminated.The cruise industry is one of the fastest growing segments of the travel and leisure industry, growing at a pace of about nine percent annually. Loopholes in U.S. laws and regulations have essentially ceded this burgeoning vacation business to companies operating cruise ships under flags-of-convenience. With the exception of the single U.S.-flag oceangoing cruise ship operating in my State of Hawaii, there are no U.S.-flag oceangoing passenger liners. The U.S.-flag Cruise Ship Pilot Project, enacted to help jumpstart the U.S.-flag cruise industry, will change that and will give Americans a foothold in a cruise industry now dominated by foreign cruise lines.The revitalization of the American cruise business is vital to our economic and national security. The Department of Defense has stated that the Pilot Project alone could save it ``tens to hundreds of millions of dollars'' in shipyard overhead costs. It also helps to sustain the shipbuilding industrial base of the U.S., which is vital to national security. The thousands of jobs created will help maintain the manpower necessary for building and crewing ships in times of national emergencies. The Department of Defense has also expressed an interest in utilizing the hull designs for cruise ships for command and control vessels in the future.Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see a resurgence of interest in the U.S.-flag cruise business. At least three companies have publicly expressed a desire to build U.S.-flag cruise ships in a U.S. shipyard for the American cruise market. Future construction in this area will improve the worldwide competitiveness of U.S. shipyards, and Litton Ingalls Shipbuilding is leading the way for America's re-entry into this growing marketplace. These efforts are important to the future of the U.S. shipbuilding industry, a U.S.-flag maritime industry, and our national security.I am looking forward to the day when American Classic begins operating these new ships in Hawaii, bringing with it thousands of seagoing and shoreside jobs. Projects such as this will help renew America's leadership in commercial ship construction and in the cruise industry. I hope that Congress will do all it can to help revitalize this vital American industry.",

Res. 549 introduced by my colleagues the gentleman from California (Mr. Gallegly), whom I am very happy to see on the floor today, and the co-chair of the Reserve and Guard Caucus the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor), who is also with us, which recognizes the 10th anniversary of the National Guard and Reserves in Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield.H. Res. 549 acknowledges the contribution of the more than 267,000 members of the National Guard and Reserves that were ordered to active duty to serve or support operations. Their activation and participation In Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm was a historic chapter in our nation's effort to achieve a total integrated force.Although the United States and its allied forces overwhelmed the Iraqi opposition, Operation Desert Storm and Operation Desert Shield were not bloodless. Fifty-seven members of the National Guard and Reserves lost their lives in service. As we recognize the 10th anniversary of the contributions of the National Guard and Reserve to Operation Desert Storm and Operation Desert Shield, let us also remember and honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect our nation.From enforcing the no-fly zone over Northern Iraq to supporting activities of Southern Watch, Guard and Reservists continue to support military operations in Southwest Asia. With 47 percent of the Army's combat support service units in the Reserves, the Guard and Reserves are increasingly becoming vital to the security of our country.As President Clinton recently said, the ``reserves are essential to America's military strength; they are part of the total force we bring to bear whenever our men and women in uniform are called to action.'' In the years following the activation for the Desert Shield and Desert Storm the country has called upon its Reservists repeatedly.In Haiti we called some 8,000 to active duty. For peacekeeping operations in Bosnia, we have called over 19,000 to date, and with volunteers, we have cycled over 32,000 Guard and Reserve members through Bosnia.Mr. Speaker, we will continue to call upon them. The bottom line is that today we simply cannot undertake sustained operations anywhere in the world without the Guard and Reserve.Let me pay tribute to the 267,000 Guard and Reservists who served during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm as we recognize the 10th anniversary of their activation, and thank the 1.3 million Ready Reservists who are currently serving for their dedication and sacrifice.",

    "title": "EXPRESSING POLICY OF UNITED STATES REGARDING ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH NATIVE HAWAIIANS",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, before I yield time to my colleague from Hawaii, may I thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Hansen), in particular, and the rest of the members of the committee, both Republican and Democrat, for their support of the bill; and may I express yet once again publicly to my chairman, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), my profound gratitude for his understanding, his concern and his perseverance, dedication and focus on this bill.Mr. Speaker, I am here today to urge the House of Representatives' approval of H.R. 4904, a bill to provide a process for the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian government and the recognition by the United States of the Native Hawaiian government.On January 17, 1893, the government of the Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown with the assistance of the United States Minister and U.S. Marines. One hundred years later, a resolution extending an apology on behalf of the United States to Native Hawaiians for the illegal overthrow of the Native Hawaiian government and calling for a reconciliation of the relationship between the United States and Native Hawaiians was enacted to law.The Apology Resolution acknowledges that the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States. Further, it acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over the their national lands to the United States, either through their government or through a plebiscite or referendum.Since the loss of their government, Native Hawaiians have sought to maintain political authority within their community. In 1978, Hawaii citizens of all races recognized the long-standing efforts of the indigenous people to give expression to their rights to self-determination and self-governance by amending the state constitution to provide for the establishment of a quasi-sovereign state agency, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. The state constitution provides that the Office is to be governed by nine Native Hawaiian trustees who are elected by Native Hawaiians. The Office of Hawaiian Affairs administers programs and services with revenues derived from lands which were ceded back to the State of Hawaii upon its admission into the United States. The dedication of these revenues reflects the provisions of the 1959 Hawaii Admissions Act, which provides that the ceded lands and the revenues derived therefrom should be held by the State of Hawaii as a public trust for five purposes--one of which is the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians. The Admissions Act also provides that the state would assume a trust responsibility for approximately 203,500 acres of land that had previously been set aside for Native Hawaiians under a 1921 federal law, the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act.Four weeks ago, the House Resources Committee and the Senate Indian Affairs Committee held five days of joint hearings in Hawaii on H.R. 4904 and its companion in the Senate, S. 2899. More than 150 people presented oral testimony to the committees and several hundred others presented written testimony. The testimony received by the committees was overwhelmingly in support of the bills. In addition to witnesses from the Native Hawaiian community, representatives of the Departments of Justice and Interior, the President of the National Congress of American Indians, the President of the Alaska Federation of Natives, and the President of the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indians presented oral testimony in support of the bills.With the passage of H.R. 4904, the Congress will provide a process for the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian government, and the recognition by the United States of that government for purposes of carrying on a government-to-government relationship. This bill provides that the indigenous, native people of Hawaii--Native Hawaiians--might have the same opportunities that are afforded under federal law and policy to the other indigenous, native people of the United States--American Indians and Alaska Natives--to give expression to their rights to self-determination and self-governance.It is also important to note that the United States Congress has enacted over 160 laws designed to address the conditions of Native Hawaiians. These federal laws provide for the provision of health care, education, job training, the preservation of native languages, the protection of Native American graves and the repatriation of Native American human remains. Thus, the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian government would not necessitate a host of new federal programs to serve Native Hawaiians. Nor would the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian government have any impact on programs or the funding for programs that are authorized to address the conditions of American Indians and Alaska Natives. For the last 90 years, Native Hawaiian programs have always been funded under separate authorizations with separate appropriations.Some have asked whether the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian government might also authorize that government to conduct gaming. The answer to that question is a simple ``no.'' The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act authorizes Indian tribal governments to conduct gaming on Indian reservations or Indian lands held in trust by the United States, and the scope of gaming under the act is a function of state law. But there are no Indian tribal governments in Hawaii, nor are there Indian reservations or Indian lands. And the State of Hawaii is one of two states in the union that criminally prohibit all forms of gaming.In developing and refining this measure, we have worked not only with the a community, but with representatives of the federal and state governments, with leaders of the Alaska Native and Native American communities, and with the congressional caucuses. The bill that is before the House today has been revised as a result of the testimony received at the hearings in Hawaii and in Washington, D.C.Our objectives are simple and straightforward. As a matter of federal policy and federal law, we want to assure that the United States government deals with all of the indigenous, native people of the United States in a consistent manner--recognizing and supporting their rights to self-determination and self-governance. This is the right thing to do and I am honored to play a part in the passage of this measure. I ask my colleagues for their support.Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink).(Mrs. MINK of Hawaii asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)",

    "title": "PROVIDING FOR VOTING IN MILITARY INSTALLATIONS",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise reluctantly in opposition to One important component of U.S. foreign policy is the promotion of democracies world-wide. Each time the U.S. supports a fledgling democracy, we insist on a clear decoupling of the civilian leadership and a nation's military. We insist that the military subsume itself to civilian control by elected officials. This principle is as important today as it was to our Founders. Because of the strength of that principle I must stand in strong opposition to the measure before us today. Protection of this enduring principle requires adherence to established procedures.There is a longstanding tradition of avoiding the politicization of military bases. Polling activity brings with it electioneering, and that activity on a military base is clearly inappropriate.Military personnel vote at their home of record. For most, this means that they vote through absentee ballot. There is no indication that military personnel are currently disenfranchised, and that this measure would be necessary.There may be legal considerations regarding the assignment of precincts and other state election laws. These may conflict with federal considerations.The addition of new polling places may require that the states provide new balloting machines. There is no funding for this under this measure, and may therefore present the states with an unfunded mandate. Many of our bases are open bases with free access to civilians. However, some bases are not for national security and/or force protection reasons. It is unclear how this bill would affect those concerns.In addition, the Department of Defense is opposed to this provision. This provision deserves to be taken through the normal committee process, and not be considered under suspension of the rules.Most Important: There have been no hearings on this measure. Many questions, such as those above, should be fully investigated through the committee hearing process before this bill is brought to the floor.A citizen's right to vote is the linchpin of our democracy, therefore nothing should be held in higher regard nor given more deference. This bill should be afforded a full and comprehensive review by the entire Congress through established procedures. Anything short of that is irresponsible and borders on weakening the time-tested foundations of democracy.Mr. Speaker, I include additional material for the Record.The Department of Defense has a standing policy prohibiting the use of federal, active military and reserve facilities as polling or voting places. The Department believes that the military should not be involved in any way in the electoral process, in order to avoid the possibility or the perception of voter coercion or intimidation by military personnel or a military presence, or the perception that the military has authority over the election process. The principle that the military should remain separated from the electoral process is reflected in existing laws imposing criminal penalties on commanders who station troops or armed men at any place where a special or general election is held, and on members of the Armed Forces who impose regulations on the conduct of such elections or otherwise interfere in any manner with an election officer's discharge of his duties. See 18 U.S.C. 592, 593. Locating polling places on military installations, where a commander's authority is paramount, in inconsistent with DoD policy and runs the risk of exposing military personnel to criminal sanctions.Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton).(Mr. SKELTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)",

I believe it is an act, if you will, of self-preservation of a democracy, certainly our democracy. Because free speech is so important, I think the gentleman is quite correct in observing that it is unlikely that commanders would like to have political activity, sign-holding, et cetera, very near a polling place if it was in the middle of a base.I expect different jurisdictions across the Nation have different rules with respect to how close to a voting booth one can actually politic, but nonetheless, it is unlikely that military bases would find themselves easily resolving those kinds of questions.My point, in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, is that while this is an idea that certainly should receive full discussion and consideration, passing it at this time has not allowed for that.

And I must say in conclusion, that it just seemed perfectly natural to me when the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett) came up and asked for my support that he would be leading the charge on this particular piece of legislation.It is a pleasure to be working with him and to have the opportunity to join with him in supporting this bill.Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5314, introduced by my friend and Armed Services Committee colleague, Mr. Roscoe Bartlett. The bill before the House today would terminate the Department of Defense policy of putting down aging military working dogs and provide for their adoptionCurrently, there is no policy to allow these elderly dogs to be retired and transferred to an individual or private entity that could provide appropriate care for these aging dogs.H.R. 5314 would address this unfortunate situation and allow elderly military working dogs to be adopted by law enforcement agencies, former handlers, and other persons capable of humanely caring for these fine animals. The bill also includes a provision that limits the Federal Government's liability in cases where a former military working dog is transferred.H.R. 5314 allows the commander of the individual dog's unit to decide whether a particular military working dog is suitable for adoption. This will afford military working dogs the same treatment given to those dogs who serve on our community police forces, and allow military working dogs to retire and enjoy the last few years of their life.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",

While he will step down as chairman next year, I know that he will continue to contribute to the committee's efforts to improve the quality of life for our service members and their families and provide for a strong national defense.I would also like to acknowledge the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton), the ranking member, for his guidance and leadership. Both individuals have placed the security of our country above partisan struggle and have continued the committee's tradition of bipartisanship and cooperation.As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, I am proud to say that the conference agreement before us includes quite a list of accomplishments in the personnel arena. We are sending a strong signal to the men and women in uniform that we have listened to their concerns about their need to provide for a quality of life for themselves and their families, and we have taken the steps to address those concerns.I also am particularly pleased that a number of health care provisions that I proposed have been adopted. I want to recognize the efforts of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel chairman, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer), for his dedication and commitment to improving the lives of our service members.Working together, and I want to emphasize that point, Mr. Speaker, working together, we have made major strides in providing for our service members, retirees, and their families.Finally, I would like to thank the full committee staff and, in particular, the Subcommittee on Military Personnel staff, including Debra Wada, Nancy Warner, John Chapla, Mike Higgins and Ed Eyatt. It is a terrific team, Mr. Speaker, one that this body can be proud of; and it exemplifies the kind of staff work that the entire community of people throughout the United States can be proud of. The scope of their assistance is immeasurable.Let me conclude, Mr. Speaker, by referring to one of the most important aspects of the bill, which is the promise that we keep our Medicare-eligible military retirees to restore access to lifetime military health care. The gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer) has gone into this in some detail.The conference agreement allows the Medicare-eligible retirees who are currently forced out of the system when they turn 65 to continue their coverage under TRICARE. Mr. Speaker, I realize I am at the end of my remarks, but I would like to emphasize as I close that the bipartisanship that we have enjoyed I hope will continue regardless of what happens in November, and I for one am pledged to it.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is with deep admiration that I rise to express gratitude and respect for the sacrifices given of the men and women serving on board the U.S.S. Cole.Speaking as the senior Democrat on the Subcommittee on Military Personnel of the Committee on Armed Services, I want to indicate that these men and women, like thousands of other Americans across the world, volunteered each and every day to defend and protect this Nation. Sadly, on October 12, several sailors of the U.S.S. Cole paid the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our country while carrying out their duties. My heart and prayers are with these sailors' friends, families and loved ones.Despite the explosion that ripped through the U.S.S. Cole and wounded many members of the crew, these dedicated sailors continue to defend their ship and rescue other wounded shipmates. Their actions exemplify the perseverance of Americans and the finest tradition of our Armed Services.I want to commend and pay tribute to these selfless Americans for their service and dedication and wish them a speedy recovery.Mr. Speaker, terrible events such as these put a face to patriotism. They remind us that those in uniform around the world are young men and women from our towns and cities who volunteer in service to their country. Last year, they graduated from high school down the street; perhaps they worked at the corner store. Today they unflinchingly stare danger in the face with selfless dedication.This tragedy reminds us of the human element of our armed forces and highlights the importance of maintaining a focus on those policies that best serve these young patriots, our military personnel, and enhance the quality of their lives.Finally, this tragedy offers a window into the composition of today's military. I want to quote, Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, a piece from yesterday's Boston Globe: ``The faces of the 17 sailors who were killed aboard the U.S.S. Cole by a terrorist bomb attack last week are a portrait of today's America, a mosaic of colors of which the U.S. military is justly proud. To call out their given names is to sing a contemporary chorus of `This Land is Your Land.' Two of the casualties even represent a grim kind of civil rights milestone: They are the first women killed in naval action.''Mr. Speaker, the crew of the U.S.S. Cole embodies what is great in America--our people and their courage, dedication, commitment, and sacrifice. To the crew of the U.S.S. Cole, their families, friends and loved ones, thank you for your service to a most grateful nation.",

    "title": "HAWAII WATER RESOURCES ACT OF 2000",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I support S. 1694, the Hawaii Water Resources Development Act and urge its passage.The legislation authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to undertake a study of the reclamation and reuse of water and wastewater in Hawaii. The Bureau is to survey irrigation and water delivery systems, identifying the costs of rehabilitating systems and evaluating future water demand.Much of Hawaii is experiencing a major drought. Sugar, long the dominant agricultural product of Hawaii, is rapidly ending as a viable commercial enterprise, freeing vast quantities of water previously devoted to irrigation. Both factors result in the need to determine prudent use of existing water resources to meet future demands.In the last 10 years, 96 sugar farms and plantations have closed and only two substantial plantations remain in commercial production. Over 130,000 of 180,000 acres previously in sugar cane production is now idle. Although economic dislocations have resulted, it also affords Hawaii the first opportunity in more than a century to diversify the agricultural sector of our economy. Diversified agriculture is now growing at 5.5% annual rate, surpassing $300 million in value. Vast tracts of some of the most productive land in the world, however, remain empty and idle. The availability of water will be a key factor in determining how these lands will be used for generations to come.The present water resources transportation and irrigation systems began in 1856 and now involve some of the most extensive and hydraulically complex systems in the world, involving tunnels blasted through mountains, open ditches, syphons and channels carrying water from the wetter sides of the islands to the interior and leeward sides for irrigation. Because of declining use, these facilities, engineering marvels of their time, are falling into disrepair. There may also be opportunities to restore traditional watersheds. But in all cases, it is essential that a comprehensive study be undertaken to assess our current needs and resources before these crucial decisions are made. Under all existing and projected scenarios, water usage will remain high.Many see Hawaii as a lush paradise filled with unique sights and recreational opportunities. It certainly is all of those, but it would be fewer of those things without water, which is not abundant in many parts of the islands. Prior to 1856, what is now some of the most fertile and productive land in the world was arid due to the geological characteristics of the Hawaiian Islands whereby most of the rain falls in the mountain ranges and windward sides, leaving the interior and leeward sides often sparse in rainfall. S. 1694, initiated by Senator Akaka, authorizes an important study, focusing on opportunities for water reuse, recycling, reclamation and conservation of water and wastewater for agriculture and non-agriculture uses.It is essential to the future of generations to come to Hawaii that wise decisions on water conservation and allocation be made. Enactment of S. 1694 is a major step in that direction and I urge passage of the bill.",

    "title": "PROMOTION OF ADOPTION OF MILITARY WORKING DOGS",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5314 as passed by the Senate. The bill before the House today promotes the adoption of military working dogs at the end of their useful working life as the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett) indicated or if the dog is otherwise excess to the needs of the Department.Currently, the Department of Defense does not have a policy to allow these elderly dogs to be retired and transferred to an individual or a private entity that could provide appropriate care for the aging dogs.H.R. 5314 would address this unfortunate situation and allow elderly military working dogs to be adopted by law enforcement agencies, former handlers, and other persons capable of humanely caring for these honorable military animals. The bill also includes a provision that limits the Federal Government's liability in cases where a former military working dog is transferred.H.R. 5314 provides military working dogs the same rights as dogs that serve in our community police forces.Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett) for his leadership in this issue. When first examined, Mr. Speaker, it seems to be something which might not necessarily be superfluous but something which, on the surface, is something that people do not even have any idea that the situation was occurring.I think people just assume quite naturally that, after a useful working life, that animals would be taken care of in a fashion other than having their lives ended. The gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett) took the lead on this, and I want to thank him for it.I think people all across the country, and I can tell my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, for sure, once folks in my district found out that I was working with the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett) on this, let me know in no uncertain terms that they wanted this bill to pass. If for no other reason, Mr. Speaker, if I could address the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett) directly, I want to tell him he is a new hero to my wife; and he most certainly can count on my support as a result for his concern for these loyal working military animals.So with that, Mr. Speaker, I urge most vehemently my colleagues to support this measure and congratulate the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett), not only for his leadership on the issue, but for exhibiting yet once again his concern for all elements of military issues coming before our committee. It is an honor to serve with him.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, for those who do not think about this every day when they get up, this debate may seem rather esoteric and a bit almost beside the point; but for those of our constituents who are concerned about this issue, let me tell my colleagues, they think about it every day. They think about it all the time. They think about it in terms that are very, very personal to them.I do not think that I have ever involved myself with a domestic issue that has had the same kind of impact personally, psychologically, and emotionally as this issue has had with my constituents. People that I have known personally in the islands for the better part of four decades, many of whom have not agreed with me philosophically, ideologically in terms of politics are united around this issue. And the fact that it may not provide every aspect, every element that they would like to see in terms of immediacy; the fact that they will have to come to grips with capital gains taxation that they might not otherwise have anticipated; and the fact that they understand that this bill is in a process of becoming that what passes today is unlikely to be the final answer, that some of the immediacy that is involved in the substitute that the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) and others have put together in good faith may become part of the equation.Those facts, yes, enter into it; but fundamentally, what they want is the passage of this bill, and they want to be able to see and say who is on their side on this. And I am afraid that our substitute, the amendment, as such, despite its good intentions, will not measure in that regard.The other aspect of this that is very, very important and what hit me so hard is that this is a jobs bill. We tend not to look at that aspect of it. Businesses which have to be sold in order to meet the estate tax burden involve dozens, sometimes hundreds of people whose jobs, whose welfare, whose obligations, whose responsibilities are put in jeopardy. I do not think we can do that.This is involved with families. This is involved in a way that people have a tremendous emotional commitment to, and I think as Democrats and Republicans we need to respond to it with an overwhelming vote in favor of the estate tax repeal.",

    "title": "UNITED STATES MISSILE DEFENSE",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, with the President making his remarks today on missile defense, I think we need to recognize unprecedented political challenges loom on the strategic horizon. Current U.S. defense force planning is set within an atmosphere of great uncertainty. Historic rivals of the United States, such as the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc nations, have either disintegrated altogether or lost much of their competitive influence.Regional state actors, particularly on the Asian continent, show signs of future ascendancy on the world political stage. Other nation states, some exhibiting anti-U.S. bent, continue to challenge American allies and interests around the world, even as U.S. peacekeeping and peacemaking commitments evolve.The very definition of American interests is in transition as varied threats emerge in the post-Cold War world.International corruption, organized crime, and the production, trade, and trafficking of illicit narcotics is on the rise. These transnational threats contribute to the instability of political systems abroad, the violation of U.S. borders, and often represent a threat to social conditions in the United States.The threat of terrorism, both state and non-state sponsored, has grown in significance and Americans have increasingly become targets for attackers abroad. According to a December 2000 unclassified Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report, terrorist attacks against the United States, its forces, facilities, and interests overseas are expected to increase over the next decade. Additionally the report states, ``Between now and 2015 terrorist tactics will become increasingly sophisticated and designed to achieve mass casualities.'' This potential threat is of particular concern for the United States with its open borders, emphasis on local--and perhaps uncoordinated--emergency responders, and a prevalent cultural respect for civil liberties, and, thus, freedom of movement and action. Antiterrorist measures must address all plausible attack scenarios, including the delivery of an explosive device by more traditional means, such as by ship, rail, foot, or automotive vehicle.The availability of advanced technologies has also reached a significant level of concern as Russia, China, and North Korea, continue to exhibit ambivalent attitudes towards nonproliferation agreements.The 2001 Report of the Secretary of Defense to the President and the Congress notes the spread of materials with potential applications to nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, and highlights the proliferation of advanced long-range delivery systems.Another study, the Quadrennial Defense Review 2001 Working Group by the National Defense University laments, and I quote, ``Given the diffusion of advanced military technologies and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, one could envision an adversary armed with longer-range missiles and cruise missiles, weapons of mass destruction, advanced integrated air defense systems, and/or sophisticated anti-ship mines and missiles by 2010, if not sooner.''U.S. military forces, then--forward deployed to temper adversarial behavior and required to provide both a credible deterrence and an overwhelming response to aggression if needed--face new and multiple challenges, not the least of which is to consider anew its role in assisting with defense of national territory.Set within this context, U.S. strategists are challenged with questions about nuclear strategy and force posture, arms control regimes, and missile defense modernization options. Missile proliferation has introduced an immediate threat to American uniformed personnel stationed abroad, and brought to the fore the prospect of ballistic missile attack on the United States as a real possibility within the next 5 to 7 years.China, Russia, and North Korea each have well-armed missiles capable of striking parts or all of the United States, and other nations, such as Iran, may possess similar technology in the not too distant future.This new setting has led some to call for a new strategic synthesis and a doctrinal requirement to, in the words of Michael Krepon, and I quote, ``reduce the dangers from missiles and weapons of mass destruction in the uncertain period ahead.''Still, the view of the threat from abroad should not create a threat from within. An effort must be made to avoid strategic decisions that might antagonize our international competitors and/or partners, leading them to adopt a posture even more belligerent in nature. Krepon suggests, and I quote, ``The net effect of missile deployments should be to reinforce reductions in nuclear forces, reassure allies, support nonproliferation partners, and reduce the salience of missiles and weapons of mass destruction.''Thus, the threat to America should be viewed holistically. It should be viewed with an eye receptive to the benefits of negotiation, diplomacy, and arms reduction possibilities, mindful of adversarial intent. The possibility of a threat does not necessarily deem it likely. Whereas missile threats to the United States and allies indeed exist and are likely to increase, other threats also remain. America, therefore, should invest in a force structure commensurate with likely threats. Above all, consideration of missile defense systems must not acquire a 21st century Maginot Line mentality.Calls for nonpartisanship respecting an issue are generally rhetorical and strategic in nature as regards their political origin. Missile doctrine made manifest in congressional policy, however, cries out for just that approach. No other defense posture is as pregnant with controversy and potential for bitter political conflict. The costs of commitment alone set off warning bells throughout the budget spectrum. Discussion can rapidly descend into confrontation and accusation if we do not pledge to bring serious, sober consideration and resolution to the table. What is needed presently is the equivalent of a congressional deep breath.We need to remember the various missile launch scenarios are abstract evaluations and the solutions promulgated in response are visions, for the most part, still on paper and in the mind's eye.Missiles, offensive or defensive, are at best a technological answer to a military question, not a diplomatic answer to a question of negotiation. International diplomacy and national policy remain an art, not a science. Science is fixed and immutable in its consequence, while art, as Andy Warhol said, is what one can get away with.Congress must guard against allowing missile defense systems becoming the policy, allowing the technology, in effect, to develop its own psychology. There is gradually being created in the United States a burgeoning military and corporate apparatus dependent in large measure on missile defense to rationalize its existence.It is imperative, therefore, that the Congress assess the role of missile defense policy in the overall context of national security and economic stability. The issues are real. The responsibility is ours.",

    "title": "ASIAN ELEPHANT CONSERVATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2001",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, before I begin my formal remarks, I would like to pay tribute to my good friend, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton). I think he is being a bit modest by simply citing the fact that he introduced this Asian elephant conservation bill and gave me the privilege of being able to sign it with him as the ranking member on his committee at that time.I am very grateful to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Gilchrest) and his staff, both for the majority and the minority, not only for the reauthorization on the present H.R. 700, but for the incredible, great work that the staff did with the introduction of the original bill.My respect for the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton), I can say without reservation, was considerable before this took place, and has only risen since that time. If there is anyone in this body that carries through on the implications of any legislation with which he or she is associated, it is the gentleman from New Jersey.In this particular instance, as he cited in his remarks, the Asian elephant simply did not have the kind of profile, either in world opinion or in the consciousness of those interested in the environment and conservation throughout the world, that the African elephant did.The reauthorization in the previous bill is, of course, needed, and the work that has been done with regard to the African elephant and the role played by the United States of America in that has been considerable and most positive, as has been cited. But in this particular instance, because of the insight and the carry-through of the gentleman from New Jersey, the Asian elephant was able to achieve at least some place in the sun that it would not otherwise have occupied.The implications for southeast Asia in particular are considerable because, as I will state in my more formal remarks, the Asian elephant is in fact a flagship species with respect to all kinds of considerations in the environment and conservation of other species, and I firmly believe that in time to come, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton) will be recognized not only as a pioneer with regard to Asian elephant conservation, but as one of the primary figures in the world environmental and conservation movement.I wish to add one other thing, Mr. Speaker. I also want to pay tribute to, and I wish he was on the floor so I actually could look him in the eye when I was saying it, because of the pleasure it would give me, I want to mention in particular the gentleman from California (Mr. Pombo), who has been instrumental in educating me for one, I can tell the Members, on the questions of conservation of wild animals and the environment.I think he has played a particularly positive role in support of the kinds of things that the gentleman from New Jersey has taken the lead on, and especially in the realm of wild animal conservation, the gentleman from California (Mr. Pombo) is a leader. It is a pleasure to be associated with him in this regard, as well.That said, Mr. Speaker, with recent awareness of the increasing threat to the welfare of the Asian elephant, an already endangered species, a bill entitled the Asian Elephant Conservation Act of 1997 was introduced into the House of Representatives in June of 1997. It passed the House in October, on October 21, and the Senate on November 8, and was signed into law by the President on November 19, 1997.The act is designed to assist the conservation of Asian elephants by supporting and providing financial resources for the conservation programs of nations within the range of the Asian elephant, and projects of persons with demonstrated expertise in the conservation of Asian elephants. A grants program was established for awarding proposals that fulfilled the purpose described by the act.This act has been very successful, Mr. Speaker, and is not a foreign giveaway program. The funds appropriated under this act are matched by the recipient countries. It gives them the necessary support so they can leverage this money with their own resources to establish conservation and research programs, communication networks and administration, to save these endangered animals.Unless immediate steps are taken to conserve this magnificent animal, it will surely continue to disappear from much, if not most, of its traditional habitat. This program helps establish a win-win situation where recipient countries can explore management strategies that minimize poaching and negative elephant and human interaction in farming communities. In short, recipient countries are able to find solutions that are in their economic best interests.Also assisting these countries on a wide range of projects are numerous non-governmental organizations and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our good friends, the chairman and the ranking member, for giving us the opportunity to appear here. I want to say that while, for many, bills which come on the consent calendar may seem to be pro forma in presentation, over and over and over again when we examine the content and context of the bills before us, we find that they are addressing issues of prime importance, not only to people of the United States, but in many instances we can say to people of the world. This bill is in fact one of them. I am very, very pleased and proud to have been associated with it, and count it as among the genuine privileges of holding public office, particularly in the House of representatives, to be associated with the individuals who have made this day possible.Mr. Speaker, the Asian Elephant Conservation Act of 1997 was authored by U.S. Representative Jim Saxton (R-NJ) and myself.With recent awareness of the increasing threat to the welfare of the Asian elephant, already an endangered species, a bill entitled Asian Elephant Conservation Act of 1997 was introduced into the House of Representatives June 4, 1997. Passed by the House on October 21 and by the Senate on November 8, it was signed into law by the President on November 19, 1997. The act is designed to assist in the conservation of Asian elephants by supporting and providing financial resources for the conservation programs of nations within the range of Asian elephants and projects of persons with demonstrated expertise in the conservation of Asian elephants. A grants program was established for awarding proposals that fulfill the purpose described by the Act.This act has been very successful and is not a foreign ``give-away'' program. The funds appropriated under this Act are matched by the recipient countries. It gives them the necessary support so that they can leverage this money with their own resources to establish conservation and research programs, communication networks and administration to save these endangered animals.Unless immediate steps are taken to conserve this magnificent animal, it will surely continue to disappear from much, if not most, of its traditional habitat.This program helps establish a win-win situation where recipient countries can explore management strategies that minimize poaching and negative elephant and human interaction in farming communities.In short, recipient countries are able to find solutions that are in their economic best interests. Also assisting these countries on a wide range of projects are numerous non-governmental organizations and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.The United States must continue their leadership in this very important conservation program. I cannot overemphasize that this is where a relatively small appropriation has helped leverage a very successful program that has stopped the decline of the Asian elephant saving it from possible extinction.We cannot allow the Asian elephant, which has such a direct impact on so many other species, to become extinct. The goal of this legislation is to stop the decline and hopefully rebuild the population of this irreplaceable species by financing with a small amount of federal money a number of conservation projects.According to international experts, there are fewer than 45,000 Asian elephants living in the wild. On a daily basis, these animals face the loss of their forest habitat, poachers who kill them for their bones, hide, ivory and meat, capture for use in Burma's timber industry, and conflicts between elephants and man.Unless immediate steps are taken to help conserve this species, it will continue to disappear from its historic habitat. We should not allow this magnificent animal to disappear from this planet. This investment by the United States will significantly improve the likelihood that wild Asian elephants will exist into the 21st century.The act was modeled after the highly successful African Elephant Conservation Act of 1988 and the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act of 1994.It established an Asian Elephant Conservation Fund to be administered by the U.S. Department of Interior. The measure would be authorized for 5 years and $5 million per year.The funding could be used for: Anti-poaching efforts, conservation management plans, translocation of threatened populations, monitoring of census figures and known populations, and public education for elephant conservation.This legislation is endorsed by organizations like the World Wildlife Fund, Safari Club International and other conservation groups.Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the following information on the Asian elephant:There are an estimated 35,000 to 45,000 Asian Elephants living in the wild in 13 Asian nations. The Asian Elephant is listed as ``endangered'' under the United States' Endangered Species Act. The major causes for elephants' ``endangered'' status are: Loss of habitat caused by population growth (all Asian Elephants required a shady or forest environment and the forest habitat in Asia is rapidly disappearing); fragmented populations of elephants (there are only 14 populations that have more than 1,000 elephants each); and poaching for meat, hide bones, ivory and teeth (bones and teeth are used in traditional Chinese medicine). The largest population of Asian Elephants in the wild are found in: India (20,000 to 24,000), Burma (5,000 to 6,0900), and Indonesia (2,500 to 4,500). Wild elephants are still captured and trained for use in logging operations in Burma. The Asian Elephant is a flagship species and its conservation has a positive impact on other animals like tigers, rhinoceros, clouded leopards, Malayan Sunbears, Hoolock gibbons, lion-tailed macaques and peacock pheasants. The Asian elephant can weigh up to 5400 kg (11,900 lb). It currently occupies forested habitats in hilly or mountainous terrain, up to about 3600 m (11,800'). An adult eats approximately 150 kg (330 lb) per day--mainly grasses but also leaves, twigs and bark. It feeds during the morning, evening and night and rests during the middle of the day, requiring shade during the hot season to keep from overheating. Elephants cannot go for long without water (they require 70-90 liters (19-24 gal) of fluid/day) and sometimes must travel long distances each day between their water supplies and feeding areas. One calf is born every 3-4 years after a pregnancy lasting about 22 months. Although mature male elephants may live alone, females live in family groups consisting of mothers, daughters and sisters, together with immature males. Wild elephants can live to be sixty years old. The Asian elephant once ranged from the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in ancient Mesopotamia in the west, east through Asia south of the Himalaya to Indochina and the Malay Peninsula, including Sri Lanka and Sumatra and possibly Java, and north into China at least as far as the Yangtze River. In the 19th century it was still common over much of the Indian subcontinent, Sri Lanka and the eastern parts of its range. By 1978, Asian elephant were found in the same countries as they are at present. Female Asian elephants are not affected by ivory poaching (due to their lack of tusks), so poaching has not affected the overall population numbers of Asian elephants as drastically as it has in the case of the African elephant. The single most important cause of the decline of the Asian elephant has been the loss of habitat. They have also been affected by persecution due to the crop damage they are perceived to cause. Counties where it is currently found: 1996: Occurs in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. Maximum age: Sixty years in the wild (more than 80 years in captivity). Social organization: The Asian elephant is gregarious, and, although males sometimes live alone, females are always found in family groups consisting of mothers, daughters, sisters and immature males. In the 19th century, these family groups usually consisted of 30-50 animals, but much larger groups, as large as 100 individuals, were not uncommon. Sometimes an adult male can be associated with a herd. When not, adult males usually remain solitary and disperse over relatively small, widely overlapping home ranges; sometimes they gather together in small but temporary bull herds. They do not seem to be territorial, and there is a great amount of toleration between them, except possibly when the cows are in estrus. Asian elephants are very sociable and live in basic family units of one adult cow and her offspring. Daughters remain with their mothers, but sons leave at puberty, often joining bull groups or remaining solitary. Bull elephants associate with a family when a cow is in oestrus. This species does not appear to be territorial. Males have home ranges of about 15 square km, and herds of females of about 30 square km, which increases in the dry season. Seasonal migration has been made virtually impossible, due to human development. Females usually have one calf after a gestation period of 18-22 months and give birth every three to four years. The calves weigh about 100 kg at birth and suckle for about 18 months. They can eat some vegetation after several months. Asian elephants are now listed as endangered, and have long since vanished from Southwest Asia and most of China. Sri Lanka was once recognized for its large elephant populations, but today the numbers are being reduced. As the number of humans increases, the area of natural habitat that the elephants rely on is being depleted. Elephants are being forced onto farming areas, where they cause damage.",

I am pleading with my colleagues, I am making a plea to my colleagues, one Member to another. Every one of my colleagues know me here, some longer than others. Every one of us are colleagues here. Every one of us understands that if another Member asks something of someone, that something is fundamental to the very well-being of their constituents. Please give the benefit of the doubt.That is what this is about tonight. I realize, as both the chairman and as the ranking member have made clear, I am sure there are a myriad of difficulties associated with this proposition, but there is good and sufficient time subsequent to tonight to deal with all of those. I am sure the chairman would agree and that the ranking member would agree.I am here to tell Members that the State of Hawaii is at risk of bankruptcy if there is not confidence in the people of this country being able to fly. I am not trying to deal with hyperbole, I am not trying to deal in rhetorical flights, I am saying the basic, fundamental, fiscal facts of life for my State.I am pleading with the gentleman. Surely none of us are sufficiently filled with wisdom to understand the ramifications of every nuance of this legislation, but we have to have enough confidence and trust in one another to give ourselves the opportunity to come to grips with these various problems, including, Mr. Speaker, the most fundamental one.What terrorists seek to do is not necessarily to kill people. If that happens, from their point of view, well and good. But they seek to instill fear and discord and anxiety and loss of confidence. That is what this is all about. We cannot succumb to that or they win.There is not a person in here, Mr. Speaker, since Tuesday, that has cast a vote with which they were completely at ease. I do not believe that a single Member here has been completely at ease, or maybe even mostly at ease with every vote. But I plead with any Member who is thinking of objecting tonight, please do not do it. Please give us the opportunity to act as colleagues. Please do not put at risk millions of jobs, not tens of thousands, millions of jobs. Do not forget that most of the foodstuffs in this country travel by air. The exports from State to State, it is not just road, it is in the air.So we must not take a chance that the legislation that has been crafted and the money associated with it will be dealt with anything other than in circumstances in which the greatest possible care will be taken when it comes to the floor after conference.",

    "title": "NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002",
    "text": "Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, and urge my colleagues to support this important measure.This year, we lost two great friends on the House Armed Services Committee, our former Chairman, Floyd Spence from South Carolina, and Norm Sisisky from Virginia. Both of these men dedicated the majority of their time here in Congress to ensuring the defense of our Nation, and they are deeply missed on the Committee and in this Congress. Their tremendous contributions to our national defense serve an as example to this Congress as we look to strengthen our military and continue to improve living and working conditions for our men and women in uniform.I would like to recognize Chairman Stump and Ranking Member Skelton for their astute leadership of this Committee and for the bipartisan manner in which they have crafted a bill to address the immediate needs of our Armed Forces. In the venerable tradition of the Armed Services Committee, these gentlemen have worked side by side, across party lines, to provide our military with the means to defend our Nation.I would also like to commend my good friend and colleague, Jim Saxton, Chairman of the Military Installations and Facilities Subcommittee, whom I have been so fortunate to work closely with, both on Armed Services and the Resources Committees. His sincere concern for the quality of life of our troops, as well as his truly bipartisan, cooperative leadership, have guaranteed an equitable bill that directly answers the pressing needs of our military infrastructure.Finally, I would like to thank the Committee staff for their tireless work and invaluable expertise. I would especially like to thank the Military Installations and Facilities Subcommittee professional staff, George Withers and Phil Grone, who is leaving the Committee to serve as an Administration official at the Pentagon.As Ranking Member of the Military Installations and Facilities Subcommittee, I am particularly proud of the remarkable boost this bill will give to our military housing and infrastructure. The Military Construction provisions build upon a healthy budget proposed by the President, and I am gratified to see that when it comes to taking care of our service members and their families, we are all unified in opinion. Our people, and their living and working conditions, must continue to be our number one priority.The unspeakable events of September 11, 2001, should not alter our commitment to quality of life initiatives. Five carrier battlegroups are currently underway, preparing for potential offensive operations. The President has authorized mobilization of up to 50,000 Ready Reservists. Now more than ever, it is imperative that we show our appreciation for those who volunteer to go in harm's way. Even in light of extreme uncertainty about the future, these young men and women pledge to support and defend American democracy, both at home and abroad. We owe it to them, and to their families, to keep our promise of increased safety and morale in the home and in the workplace.This bill does just that. It authorizes $10.3 billion for construction and renovation of critical infrastructure and family housing, approximately $350 million more than the Administration's request. Our bill includes $1.2 billion to build 51 new barracks and dormitories for single and unaccompanied service personnel. Often, our junior, single soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines get overlooked in the rush to raise the standards on quality of life. This Committee has taken substantive steps to remedy this inequity, through improved living accommodations and a significant pay raise. The bill authorizes $1.1 billion for new construction and modernization of 6,800 family housing units--a down payment on our commitment to eradicate deteriorating, World War II-era living conditions. It also makes permanent the authorities in the Military Housing Privatization Initiative that use private sector expertise and capital to accelerate improvement of government-owned housing and help eliminate a serious shortage of quality affordable housing. Of special note, the Committee has responded to the concerns of our modern military families by recommending $36.2 million for six child development centers--a critical need for couples who both work as well as single parents.Our achievements in Military Construction will be an ongoing effort aimed at providing quality living and working facilities for our entire military family, stationed at home and overseas. I know that under Mr. Saxton's excellent stewardship, the Subcommittee on Military Installations and Facilities will continue to focus on raising the living and working standards for our Armed Forces. They have volunteered to protect our freedom. Now we must protect them by building safe, modern facilities for the 21st century military.Again, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.",

    "title": "FARM SECURITY ACT OF 2001",
    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I am strongly opposed to the amendment altering the provisions of the Agriculture Committee's bill.Make no mistake about it. The purpose of this amendment to kill the sugar program, similar to the unsuccessful attempts in the past.The amendment will keep the current program, which has devastated domestic sugar. Today, there are only two commercial sugar plantations left in Hawaii, the result of the 1996 Act which has crippled the industry and left thousands of Americans unemployed, many of them in Hawaii. What this nation needs now is more American jobs, not fewer.In addition it would cut the existing supports by $.03 a pound. A rough calculation indicates such a move would transfer $500.0 million from the domestic sugar producers to the food processors.While sugar prices have plummeted, food prices have risen. The wholesale price of sugar has dropped 29 percent since the 1996 law while sweetened product prices have risen 4 percent-14 percent. It is not difficult to determine that consumers will not see one dime of that $500.0 million. It will go straight into the pockets of the food manufacturers and processors who have soaked up all the additional revenue resulting from staggeringly low sugar prices since the 1996 Act.Not only will the food processors unfairly benefit, but more foreign-produced sugar will pour into the country. My colleagues, in numerous cases, that imported sugar will certainly be produced by child labor and with no environmental protections.How on earth are we helping either our own country or the rest of the world by adopting this amendment?We've heard reports of candy manufacturers moving to Mexico. That is their prerogative, as much as I disagree with their abandoning America. The distortion that has been perpetuated, however, is that it is because of domestic sugar prices. Nothing could be further from the truth. Domestic sugar prices in Mexico have been consistently higher in Mexico than in the U.S. The reason they and other manufacturers have moved to Mexico is that labor costs are far lower and environmental protections are unenforced and ignored.The Mexican government, and other foreign producers, then dump production in excess of their domestic consumption, regardless of their domestic price, on the world market for whatever price they can get. That is called the ``world price'' of sugar. In reality, it is the dump price, and that is the price at which the supporters of the amendment want to purchase sugar.My colleagues, this amendment is strictly about money. It is about whether money will be paid to American workers for an American product produced with environmental protections and labor standards or whether it goes directly to the food processors and manufacturers to increase their profits regardless of the consequences domestically or internationally.The House Agriculture Committee has developed a fair, rational and effective way to keep this industry producing an American product by American workers. I urge you in the strongest possible terms to reject this cynical, ill-conceived attack on American sugar producers and on hard-working people.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the plight of seven polar bears languishing in a traveling animal show called the Suarez Brothers Circus. The circus is based in Mexico and travels around Central and South America, throughout the year, with its menagerie.In May 2001, the USFWS, in consultation with USDA, decided to issue a permit to allow the circus into Puerto Rico. This permit was issued over the objection of the Marine Mammal Commission. The Commission warned that the provenance of the bears was questionable and that there were serious deficiencies in the required paperwork for the bears. In June, Dr. Terry Maple, Director of Zoo Atlanta, contacted USDA and asserted that at least one of the bears had been imported under a false identity. The use of doctored or fabricated records is grounds for denying the circus a permit to exhibit.In August, during the hottest days of summer, the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources filed animal cruelty charges against the circus for keeping the bears in 113 degree heat without access to water or air conditioning. Additional charges have been added for maintaining the bears in ``dirty or parasitic conditions''. Their trial date is scheduled for January 22, 2002.In October, the Marine Mammal Commission again wrote to USFWS and APHIS and outlined the numerous violations of federal law and expressed a fundamental concern about the appropriateness of using polar bears outdoors in a tropical climate. In their letter, the Commission noted violations of the Animal Welfare Act reported by APHIS on eight separate inspections. These violations included serious charges including inaccessibility to water and fans, a lack of structural integrity in the holding pens, and a lack of veterinary care.Just two weeks ago, APHIS testified before the Resources Committee that it has inspected the circus at least eleven times since June--as compared to the average number of inspections being one per year. The USDA has documented a clear pattern of non-compliance with the bare minimum standards of the Animal Welfare Act.Mr. Speaker, these polar bears are clearly suffering and need relief. These animals should be confiscated and placed in facilities that are capable of caring for their unique needs. Members of the House and Senate, including the Delegate from Puerto Rico, are circulating letters to colleagues and to the federal agencies requesting urgent action in this case, including an investigation and confiscation of the polar bears.Puerto Rico is no place for polar bears.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I have about 2 minutes to reach out to not just the people on this floor, but everybody who is listening in their offices. I feel like I almost have to conjure John the Baptist to get this across.Why are we debating a bill on the Andes when people are hurting all across this country right now today? If anything can be seen as showing the irrelevance of this Congress while people are losing their jobs all across this country, we cannot get a bill on this floor for a retail sales tax holiday. We cannot get the Travel America Now Act on this floor. But we can come in and get a bill so that drug dealers in the Andes can invest in gardening or anything else that they want to get into in order to come into this country and sell those products as well.Do you think for a second that the drug dealers are going out of business with this bill?We have got to come on this floor today and vote this down and demand that the Committee on Ways and Means come in here with bills that are going to address the economic problems that have happened since September 11.All this calm discussion on this floor completely bypasses what has happened to the people in this country. All the small businesses in this country that come down here and we say we honor every day in this Congress, we are ignoring them right now. I am as hot as I can be about this because we are being ignored. I feel my heart pounding every day because I see people out of work. They cannot pay their bills in the next 60 days. They cannot make their mortgage payments. They cannot tell their kids why they cannot have clothes on their backs when they go to school, and we are talking about the Andes. We are talking about we need to move. This bill is time sensitive. What is time sensitive is whether we are responding to the needs of the people in this country, right now, post-September 11.People from New York have to come down here and beg, beg this Congress to see whether we are going to respond to them. I do not want to hear any lectures about how the economy will recover in 3 years. I do not want to hear lectures on philosophic permutations that might take place in the overall economy.I want action now on behalf of the people of this country.

    "title": "OUR NATION AND THE SEA",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, on October 11, 2001, Mr. John P. Craven, the President and founder of the Common Heritage Corporation, Honolulu, Hawaii, was honored as a Doherty Lecturer in our Nation's Capital. I would like to share some of his thoughts and comments about our Nation and the sea with my colleagues by having his enclosed keynote speech entered into the Congressional Record.The days of my years are more than three score and ten and I find myself called upon to share the experiences of a lifetime of involvement with a diverse set of vocations and avocations--all involving the ocean. To be chosen as the Doherty lecturer is a particularly special invitation, inasmuch as it is an honor to which I have aspired for longer than I can remember. When to my surprise I received word of my selection, I lost no time in weighing anchor and setting sail. The formal invitation arrived several days later and I discovered that I was sailing under false colors. I was not invited, as I assumed, as the flamboyant master of submarine espionage depicted in the best selling book Blind Man's Bluff. Instead it was clear that my invitation was based on my role as the Past Director of the Law of the Sea Institute, an international NGO dedicated to the creation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. I was thus expected to say, as I will say, that it is imperative that the United States ratify this convention. It was also apparent that I was invited as the President of the Common Heritage Corporation, a company intimately involved in the use of ocean resources and dedicated to the management of innovation involved in the use of ocean resources and dedicated to the management of innovation for the benefit of humanity. I was thus also expected to say, as I will say, that society must commit itself to research and development of programs leading to the use of ocean resources and ocean space to change our world into an environmentally sustainable habitat for its burgeoned and burgeoning population. I am here today, therefore, as the wearer of three distinctly different caps: one representing my years of involvement in national security, another designating me as a proponent of translational law and justice and a third worn by an innovator of futuristic technology. Yet it is my contention that my roles are connected by more than just the ocean. They also form an integrated view of the future--a view that I believe society must come to accept for its survival. Through the anecdotes that follow, I hope to provide my fellow Americans with insights into the lessons that I have learned during my careers, with the hope of convincing you about the importance--indeed the need--of sharing my hopes and aspirations for humanity. Those of you familiar with my own recent book, The Silent War, may recall my description of ``The Polaris Marching and Chowder Society.'' This Honolulu-based group initially consisted of submariners that had a role in the development of the Polaris Fleet Ballistic Missile system (the nation's first undersea strategic deterrent). The Society has met for breakfast once each month for the past two decades. I quote from my book here: ``What prevents this breakfast from being just another gathering of old timers is the regular attendance of the active duty commander of the submarine forces of the Pacific fleet and members of his staff. This is a family breakfast and a rare opportunity for the family elders to offer their wisdom to the young in command. I am an adopted member of this family and, except for myself, all are qualified to wear the dolphins of the submarine service.'' A surprising number are also qualified to wear the master divers pin, suggesting that they are a part of the teams of ``saturated divers'' (i.e., humans as marine mammals living on the open ocean seabed of the world's continental shelves). They have carried out highly classified ``special operations'' of intelligence gathering for more than thirty years. At the Society's meeting this past October 3rd, the events of September 11th were fresh in all members' minds. I distributed copies of The Silent War to young officers who were first time breakfast attendees. I noted that my book was written with the tacit encouragement of the Navy and the Intelligence services to tell the story of these operations as they should be told, without compromising national security. The very existence of these special operations was a secret until the publication of Blind Man's Bluff. Sensitive details will not be revealed or discussed at this or any other meeting of the Marching and Chowder Society, but my book details the philosophy and strategy employed in winning the Cold War without firing a shot. The relevance of that philosophy and that strategy to the war against terrorism was a major topic at the Society's last meeting. I reminded the Society of an unclassified talk given by former CIA Director Robert Gates at a reunion of the submarine Parche--the winner of seven Presidential Unit citations. He asserted that the CIA had four classes of heroes: (1) Operatives in the field who intercepted vital communications; (2) scientists and technicians who designed equipments and units that could intercept communications; (3) the operators of these equipments in environments where their skills were required and where their lives were in danger; and (4) the analysts in the intelligence agencies who interpreted the results of these missions and transmitted them to the President for those national policy positions and actions which would deter war and win peace. Director Gates then informed the men of Parche that the missions of the United States Navy submarine service were the most important of all the missions that had been conducted and that their story ``had to be told.'' This morning meeting ended with the thought that now more than ever the story had to be told for its relevance to the new conflict. Indeed, that very morning Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld reminded the public of the long drawn out but successful Cold War experience that we might have to endure to resolve the current terrorism conflict. What emerged from that meeting were insights into what I might characterize as my first lesson of this afternoon: We cannot ask the Federal Government to reveal how many cruise missiles, cable tapping, undersea surveillance units have been built and deployed. Indeed, it is possible that nobody knows. The compartmentalization of this program within the Navy and within other Federal agencies is such that it is doubtful that any single individual has the knowledge of the ``need to know'' the full panoply of our undersea capability. What then should Americans know? At the very least, we should know and understand that the people of the United States have occupied ``inner space,'' or the oceans of our planet, in a manner that we have not accomplished or cannot hope to accomplish in outer space for a decade or more. Americans should know that we can publish and proclaim this underwater capability in a way that will not compromise national security but will tell those that would do us harm that we are in full control of the undersea environment. We should so publish; we should so proclaim. I had to leave the Chowder Society breakfast early to hasten to Washington to attend the forum on the international law of terrorism organized by our host, John Norton Moore. En route To Dulles, I was recognized by a visibly nervous flight attendant who had seen me on The History Channel. The cause of her concern was understandable to all of us I'm sure, but some reflection and perspective are in order here. This woman and a hundred or so others were hurtling through the sky at 40,000 feet and more than five hundred miles per hour--a remarkable transportation achievement. Science and technology had made air travel so safe that the statistical likelihood or her demise remained an extraordinarily low probability event--recent tragic events notwithstanding. To remind and reassure her, I gave her a copy of The Silent War inscribed with my most immediate poetic thoughts of the moment: ``And the night shall be filled with music and the cares that infest the day shall fold their tents like the nomads and as silently steal away.'' Later that evening as with headphones on my head and brandy in my hand I looked out the window to see the beautiful glow of the lights of Denver below before sweet sleep possessed me. My last thoughts were: ``Shall I be lifted to the skies on flowery beds of ease while others seek to win the prize and sail through stormy seas.'' The lesson of this anecdote was first taught to us by Franklin Delano Roosevelt as we faced the prospect of World War II: ``The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.'' Upon my arrival in Washington, I listened to a set of provocative legal papers presented by brilliant scholars including the Honorable Stephen Schwebel, former President International Court of Justice, Professor Ruth Wedgwood of the Yale Law School and Professor Malvina Halberstam of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. A central issue discussed was whether in the present instance, state sponsored assassination in defense of a terrorist would be murder or legally justified as an act of self-defense.remarked to a most distinguished legal colleague seated next to me that I thought it was a matter of perspective as to whether you were holding the trigger or peering into the barrel of a gun. My colleague shot me down with the rejoinder that my remark was political and not legal. I believe Gandhi had the better view. Certainly to the surprise of many not closely familiar with his philosophy, he has written: ``I do believe that, where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advice violence.'' To be sure, Gandhi characterized violence as an animal response to an immediate attack and non-violence, where possible, as a civilized alternative. Violence under attack becomes acceptable, however, when there is no alternative--that is when a decision to take no action emerges from fear rather than strength. This lesson is one that is particularly timely to Americans today. In any event, all participants including Schwebel agreed that the definitive word of law was enunciated by the United Nations Security Council Resolutions of September 12 and September 28. Indeed until the Security Council spoke unanimously, the United States was not assured of the protection of all of the member States in its actions against terrorist acts. Americans should finally realize that, regardless of individual political feelings about this international body, we have no choice but to seek its protection when a declaration of International Law is necessary in the face of a World crisis. The Law of the Sea Treaty is no different. This is one of the most comprehensive treaties ever negotiated and it has been modified to comply with all of the demands of the United States. Our manifest inability to enforce its provisions through our customary system of law, with the Coast Guard and internal legislation such as the Magnussen Act, demonstrates that our enforcement mechanism requires international cooperation. This cooperation can be assured only if we ratify and, parenthetically, pay our United Nations dues to support the Convention. In contemplating the critical issues concerning national security and transnational law that I have set forth this afternoon, it is essential to consider the fundamental problem from which they emerge. These issues are rooted in the underlying reality that the resources of the world are limited while the potential consumers of these resources continue to grow in numbers. Thus, I now finish my Doherty Lecture wearing the hat of the President of the Common Heritage Corporation, or CHC. I established CHC a decade ago in order to address the problems of an increasing global population, now over 6 billion, and its associated migration to the coastal zone. CHC's product is the demonstrated design of an environmentally sustainable habitat for installation on coastal deserts having access to deep ocean water. Our facility on the Kona coast of Hawaii is a showroom for the demonstration of such an installation. This showroom was specifically designed for Haiti, although our first installation may well occur in the Marshall Islands or in a form suitable for the affluent developed world on the island of Oahu. Any of you who have visited Haiti know that it is a coastal desert on the lee side of a trade wind island. It has a population of six million living in desperate and deprived conditions. The local fishing industry does not have a single motorized fishing boat or any cooling or refrigeration. Fish are caught off the northern coast and by the time they arrive in the market at Port au Prince, about a third of the catch are not edible, even by Haitian standards. Haiti's fishermen care not that the maximum sustainable yield of the ocean was exceeded some twenty-five years ago. They must fish or perish. Agriculture and manufacturing are non-existent and the government is effectively dysfunctional. Common Heritage Corporation has a joint venture agreement with a Haitian Company, ``Energie General,'' that would be capable of managing the installation of one of our facilities, if the political climate of Haiti were receptive to such an installation. Today it cannot. We nevertheless are proceeding, waiting for that day to come. What technology is in use at CHC's facility? It utilizes the sun and deep ocean water as its primary resource. Deep Ocean water or DOW is very cold, very rich in nutrients and very biologically pure. We convert seawater into fresh water in a device called a microclimate tower, which operates like nature--using the cheap cold at the top of the tower to condense vapor from hot ocean water at the bottom. We do air conditioning and industrial cooling utilizing deep ocean water that passes through reclaimed automobile radiators. We grow cold-water algae utilizing the deep ocean water nutrients, and then use the algae as compost and as food for humans, for abalone, for shrimps, lobsters and fish. We have also developed a form of agriculture that utilizes deep ocean water passing through PVC pipes in the ground, producing more than enough condensate for irrigation and a thermodynamic environment that can only be characterized as a super spring. But our facility is also designed as habitat. Accordingly, it does more than produce the basic necessities of life. Young children who visit our facility are quick to understand a habitat is more than life--it must also foster liberty and the pursuit of happiness. To that end, our facility features every kind of crop and food product, every kind of flower, parks and gardens and athletic fields for soccer and even golf. Our facility has been technically successful beyond our wildest dreams. By way of illustration, let me tell you what we are doing with grapes. We have grape vines that grow in the hot desert without any rain or external irrigation. Cold ocean water pipes embedded three feet deep at the root zone provide the irrigation water and the thermodynamic climate. When the grapes are ripe and harvested, the cold water is turned off. The vines are then pruned and, after a week of dormancy, the cold water is turned on again and the vines produce yet another crop. Three abundant crops per year are produced, one of which is illustrated by the photograph that has been distributed. But returning to Haiti briefly, we confront the basic problem that it cannot avail itself of our technology for the simple reason that it requires a significant number of dollars to install a system. Export crops are, of course, one way to raise dollars, but these crops must first be produced. In order to simulate the economic obstacles to the installation of a CHC sustainable facility in a country like Haiti, CHC operates as ``bare-bones'' a corporation as you are likely to see in the developed world. CHC has not borrowed any money from a bank. It utilizes where legal and possible its management and student trainees for construction and labor, much as is done by organizations such as Habitat for Humanity. Apart from a small amount of electric power and a very limited amount of external supplies, the entire facility is self-sustaining. Thus, the jar of jelly provided to each of you symbolically and literally represents what CHC's technology can make possible with developing world production techniques, notwithstanding all of the economic limitations. The glass jars and tops were manufactured in the Dominican Republic and purchased in bulk quantities at extremely low cost. The label was designed by a member of CHC's Board of Directors and printed using an obsolete computer printer purchased at a thrift shop. The cartons were assembled and loaded by my family here in Washington--and we could not prevent my two- year-old granddaughter from filling the boxes and applying stickers and decorations on some of the boxes as a form of play. What more can CHC do to demonstrate the viability of environmentally sustainable habitats? We carried our PowerPoint road show to Mexico and gave a high level presentation the government agency responsible for economic development for the poor. Enthralled by our presentation, they asked how much an initial 100-acre installation would cost. Between five and ten million dollars was CHC's reply--a bargain. They were appalled. The agency's entire budget for the year was only 70 million dollars--a simple result of the devaluation of the peso. Committing up to one-seventh of their resources to a single project was simply out of the question. Americans, we and other countries must find a way to avoid these Catch 22s and to start a development process that promotes an environmentally sustainable world. This world must be capable of providing all of its citizens with a reasonable standard of life. And, we must start now. I speak not from an abstract perspective of what a good and just society would do. Instead, I am asserting an imperative. The tragic incidents of the past month have revealed that we can no longer ignore the resource limitations that confront the world. The gap between rich and poor nations grows greater and greater; the population of the developing world grows at unsustainable rates, yet even the best-intentioned citizens of developed nations have done little more than engage in impassioned rhetoric. We have let our global educational and research activities atrophy and decay; we have imposed the product of our material comforts on the impoverished and peoples of the undeveloped world. Should it surprise us that people with literally nothing to lose might choose to lash out against us? We have replaced reality with a dazzling world of virtual reality, but September 11th has taught us that there are realities that we can no longer ignore. I speak from a lifetime of immersion in that real world. Even so, from that experience I conclude that there is hope. Americans we must and we can work with the World to end terrorism--there is no alternative; we must and we can work with the world to defuse the threats of war--there is no alternative; we must and we can work with the world to establish an international regime for the wise use of the ocean--there is no alternative, and; we must and we can start the development process that leads to an environmentally sustainable world habitat for humanity--there is no alternative--there is none.",

I have an article here on what was called a bone-sopping rainy day, hundreds of unemployed people in Waikiki coming hoping they could get a job working on invasive species in Hawaii, to work with their hands in the fields to try to work to make our environment better.We have 31,000 people out of work directly as a result of September 11. What I am asking is cannot the example of the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) and the appropriators here be brought to bear when we deal with the other bills that are coming forward with respect to how we are going to deal with the economic trauma that has hit the whole country?Mr. Chairman, perhaps the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas) at that time misunderstood my quest that day. I voted against the Democrat bill and the Republican bill that is supposed to be dealing with economic stimulus. Let us use what the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh) has done and what the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey), the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey) has done, and what the gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano) has done. Let us use what the gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young) has done by way of leadership on the economic stimulus program and as Republicans and Democrats draw together on behalf of the entire Nation with New York leading the way, and this amendment leading the way, showing us what we can do as Americans to come together and have victory.",

The question is whether it is in the public interest or not.I can tell my colleagues what is going to happen, and we all better remember it. All politics is local. And out where I am anyway, if anyone thinks they are going to show the football game at one time and another infomercial at another time, and that is going to work out somehow in the number of days that you got where you get the lowest rate, you are dreaming.What is going to happen is the local advertisers, aside from me or aside from my colleagues, are going to have to make up the difference. And I am not going back in my district and tell people that are trying to make a living, especially after 9/11, in their advertising that they have to pay more so that people can listen to me.All I am trying to do when I get down there is express all the virtues I have. And at least in my district they already know I am full of virtue.Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Burr-Green amendment.It obviates Section 305 of underlying bill, a provision that does not address the central issues of the campaign finance debate: soft money and so-called ``issue ads''.The language in Section 305 is well intentioned. It seeks to lower the costs of campaigns, a goal everyone agrees is worthwhile.However, the mechanism if flawed. Forcing broadcasters to charge artificially low rates for political ads only invites them to look elsewhere to make up the lost revenue. Section 305 virtually forces them to raise the rates for non-political ads.Using an example from my home state of Hawaii, is it realistic to expect a station to charge the same rate for the UH-BYU football game as for a late-night infomercial? If we force broadcasters to do that, we shouldn't be surprised when business economics compel them to charge more for the ads in slots with smaller audiences. And who ultimately winds up paying for the added charge? Not the advertisers--they're going to turn around and make it up with higher prices for their goods and services.So the ultimate subsidizer of forced ad rate reductions is--you guessed it--the consumer. That's you, me and all the people in our districts. We'll pay more for food, prescription drugs, gasoline--everything from Spam musubi to that neighbor island trip for a family reunion.The bottom line is that Burr-Green is pro-consumer. It has no effect on the thrust of Shays-Meehan. This is an amendment that every Member can support, regardless of which side of this debate you're on.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 368, introduced by my colleague, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Foley), as indicated by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton), and endorsed by numerous other Members of the House. The resolution commends the outstanding progress made thus far by the Pentagon Renovation Program and its contractors in reconstructing the section of the Pentagon damaged by the terrorist attack.On September 11, 2001, Mr. Speaker, our Nation suffered four unprovoked terrorist attacks, three of which found their aim in two of our most powerful symbols of strength and democracy. Two days after the attacks, the Army asked the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton), myself, and several other Members involved in the Subcommittee on Military Construction to visit the Pentagon site and survey the damage sustained there. Like the rest of the American public, we were stunned by the gash in what had previously seemed to be the impenetrable exterior of the Pentagon.What really caught our attention, though, was the work already under way. A small city of support was buzzing on the lawn. Firefighters were still battling flare-ups and hot spots, and military and civilian personnel were securing the building and sifting through the debris. No one was waiting to be told what to do. They were just doing what they knew needed to be done.The Pentagon Renovation Program has exceeded every expectation. The American public realized the significance of healing this visible wound as soon as possible, and the Phoenix Project has made it a reality. Government and contract personnel put their shoulders to the wheel, at times laboring around the clock, to tear down the most severely damaged sections and to rebuild it from the ground up. Demolition was supposed to take 7 or 8 months, Mr. Speaker. The team completed it in 1 month and 1 day. That is the power of American resolve.I have the utmost confidence that the Renovation Program will meet its ultimate goal to have people back at their desks by September 10, 2002. There could be no greater tribute to those who lost their lives than to know that the men and women of the Department of Defense are once again doing the business of the country from their proper Pentagon offices.Mr. Speaker, let us honor these Americans, public workers and private citizens, willing to dedicate themselves to the rebuilding of our national morale.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

Indeed the goddess of fire, ``Pele'' working through the volcanoes created most of the great State of Hawaii. She is still very active and very honored.There are specific areas in my state which are sacred to the Native Hawaiians. Although the areas do not have a large steeple or white-washed fence around them, they nonetheless deserve to be respected and protected.We have begun remediation on the sacred island of Kahoolawe and protected it from further destruction as a military bombing range. But there is so much more to be done.The problem is that we have a few laws that dance around the idea of protecting native sacred lands which use words like ``consultation'' or ``accommodate'' but are inadequate to simply stop potential desecration.Occasionally, we are able to stop the mining of one sacred site, or the demolition of another. But the time has come for Congress to enact strong legislation to protect Native American sacred lands.",

    "title": "BOB STUMP NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003",
    "text": "Mr. Chairman, although I am disappointed in the rule before this body, I rise in strong support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, and urge my colleagues to support this important measure. I deeply regret the decision of the Rules Committee to prohibit several critical amendments from being considered here today.I would first like to recognize our committee leadership, Chairman Stump and Ranking Member Skelton, for the bipartisan bill they have crafted to address the immediate needs of our Armed Forces. Our committee has a long tradition of working across party lines to ensure the readiness and well-being of our Armed Forces, and I am greatly pleased to have participated in yet another cooperative effort with my Armed Services colleagues.We all know that Chairman Stump has announced this intention to retire at the end of this Congress. His steadfast leadership, acknowledged in the title of this bill, will be missed, and I know that the entire House wishes him the best of luck in the future.I would also like to commend my very good friend, Jim Saxton, Chairman of the Military Installations and Facilities Subcommittee, whom I have been so fortunate to work closely with, both on Armed Services and the Resources Committees. His sincere concern for the quality of life of our troops, as well as his truly bipartisan, cooperative leadership, have guaranteed an equitable bill that directly answers the pressing needs for our military infrastructure.I would like to thank the committee staff for their tireless work and invaluable expertise. These professionals have been working day in and day out, weekends included, for the past two months, to put together the best bill possible. I would especially like to thank the Military Installations and Facilities Subcommittee professional staff, George Withers and Tom Hawley. No subcommittee is better served than ours with dedicated, smart, and consummate staff.As ranking member of the Military Installations and Facilities Subcommittee, I am especially concerned about the effect this bill will have on our military housing and infrastructure. Our Subcommittee labored hard to compensate for an anemic construction budget proposed by the President--a budget $1.7 billion lower than that put forward last year. From this highly unsatisfactory starting point, our Subcommittee added $425 million to fund projects vital to the Services. An ongoing campaign against global terrorism is not an excuse to abandon our campaign against substandard facilities and housing. Funding for military construction must match the rhetoric; otherwise, we will lose the battle for quality people willing to serve. Our people, and their living and working conditions, must continue to be our number one priority.Given the military's current operational tempo, it is imperative that we show our appreciation for those who volunteer to go in harm's way. These men and women pledge to support and defend American democracy, both at home and abroad, often at great personal sacrifice and for significant periods of time. We owe it to them, and to their families, to keep our promise of increased safety and morale in the home and in the workplace.In pursuit of such a goal, this bill authorizes $678.4 million--$17.7 million more than the President's request--for construction and improvement of 3,447 family housing units and the privatization of over 30,000 units. Privatization authorities, extended in last year's defense bill, provide our military accelerated opportunities to renovate and build vastly improved family housing developments with private sector capital and I applaud the continuation of this important program. Our committee also included $1.2 billion for construction of 49 new barracks and dormitories in the FY03 authorization and $8.6 million in H.R. 4547, the Cost of War Against Terrorism Authorization Act, for unaccompanied personnel housing in Qatar. Once again, attention to the living conditions of our single soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines has been a high priority for our committee, and I sincerely hope that we can bring all of our barracks up to the same excellent standard set by the Army's Whole Barracks Renewal at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. I am especially pleased to note the $17.6 million provided to build Child Development Centers. This represents funding for four such centers, $6.9 million and one more than recommended by the President's budget, and acknowledges the emphasis this Congress and the military places on the needs of service members with children. Military couples and single parents alike benefit when the military recognizes their specific needs and eases their child-care burdens.Our achievements in military construction will be an ongoing effort aimed at providing quality living and working facilities for our entire military family, stationed at home and overseas. I know that under Mr. Saxton's excellent stewardship, the Subcommittee on Military Installations and Facilities will continue to focus on raising the living and working standards for our Armed Forces. They have volunteered to protect our freedom. Now we must protect them by building safe, modern facilities for the 21st century military.Again, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the month of May 2002 as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.In June 1977, Representatives Frank Horton of New York and Norman Y. Mineta of California introduced a House resolution that called upon the President to proclaim the first 10 days of May as Asian Pacific Heritage Week. That was later followed by a Senate bill introduced the following month by Senators Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga. On October 5, 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed a Joint Resolution designating the annual celebration. In May 1990, the holiday was expanded further when President George Bush designated May to be Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. The month of May was chosen to commemorate the arrival of the first Japanese immigrants to the United States in May 1843.H. Res. 408, introduced by my colleague and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Chair, Representative David Wu, recognizes the contributions of Asian Pacific Americans to our Nation. As an original cosponsor of this resolution, I recognize and commend how Asian Pacific Americans have contributed to the prosperity and vitality of our society. Whether in government, business, education, the military, science, technology, or the arts, Asian Pacific Americans bring to our society a rich cultural heritage representing many languages, ethnicities, and religious traditions.Diversity represents one of our country's greatest strengths. I am honored to represent the State of Hawaii in Congress. Much of the character of my State and district is a result of the great diversity Asian Pacific Americans have brought to our country. I hope all Americans recognize the contributions these groups have made to our national identity and culture.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of The Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park was authorized by Congress nearly 50 years ago to preserve a truly unique relic of Hawaiian history and culture. Up until the early 19th century, Hawaiians who broke the ancient code of law could avoid an otherwise certain death by fleeting to this place of refuge, or pu'uhonua, for absolution and clemency. Defeated warriors and non-combatants could also seek refuge here during times of battle. It is this function that gave this park its name, City of Refuge, which was later changed to Pu'uhonua o Honaunau.In addition to the refuge, which is enclosed by a great wall, the surrounding land also housed several generations of powerful Hawaiian chiefs, adding to the area's great historical value. The pu'uhonua and royal grounds are still considered sacred by native Hawaiians and the sites draw a half million visitors each year who come in search of the vast cultural, spiritual, educational, and recreational opportunities the park has to offer. Visitors can attend cultural demonstrations of traditional Hawaiian arts and crafts, hike along the historic 1871 Trail to several archaeological sites, observe wildlife such as the endangered green sea turtles in Keone Ele cove, or snorkel in the clear waters of Honaunau Bay.When the National Historic Park was established in 1955, nearly two-thirds of the ancient village of Ki'ilae remained undiscovered and outside of the park in a single private ownership. Recently, the approximately 238-acre Honaunau tract, which contains the balance of the Ki'ilae Village site and a human habitation record stretching back nearly a thousand years, became available for acquisition. This property is extremely rich in pre-history, and provides important clues about ancient Hawaiian life. Agricultural structures, stone piles, and walls are interspersed among recreational sites and the burial sites of the villagers. Acquisition of this area is crucial to protect extraordinary early Hawaiian cultural sites and expand the public understanding and interpretation of cultural traditions and Hawaiian subsistence patterns. This public acquisition will safeguard this important glimpse into early Hawaiian village life and social dynamics.It is important to note that the acquisition and expansion of Pu'uhonua o Honaunau is overwhelmingly supported by the National Park Service, the County of Hawaii, and the local community. In addition, an identical version of H.R. 1906 has already passed the Senate in the form of S. 1057. All that remains is the passage of H.R. 1906 in the House of Representatives.I urge my colleagues to protect these ancient Hawaiian cultural sites and support this legislation.",

Nonetheless, we are here today under the present rules asking merely for the compensation that is due us under the treaty obligation of the United States.It is not fair to ask a State of the Union to undertake expenditures that are engendered as a result of the actions of the United States of America, nor is it fair to ask any of the territories or the Commonwealth of Marianas to assume the same costs. This is particularly true when the three entities are suffering from the decline in tourism dollars and revenue that has come in. The fact that we have borne this burden for this time should not give rise to any consideration or thought that this has been something that is equitable.So I would hope that the membership would understand, as we conclude our deliberations on the bill, that this is an amount of money that is but a minuscule portion of that which is due Guam, American Samoa, the Marianas and the State of Hawaii.The CHAIRMAN.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I take this action. The hearts of all of us here go out in sympathy to Patsy's husband, John, and her daughter, Gwen; to her brother, Eugene; to her staff in Washington and in Hawaii; and to her large family of friends and admirers.Mr. Speaker, I am devastated by her loss. Patsy Mink was more than my friend and my colleague; she was a true daughter of Hawaii. She was a person of enormous spirit and tenacity and inner strength. I will miss her terribly. I will especially miss her wisdom, her energy, her readiness to fight for principle. She fought all her life for social and economic justice.Throughout nearly 50 years of public service, she championed America's most deeply held values: equality, fairness, above all honesty. Her courage, her willingness to speak out and champion causes that others might shun resulted in tremendous contributions in the fields of civil rights and education. She has earned in my estimation an honored place in the history of the United States House of Representatives as the co-author of title IX, which guarantees equality for women in education programs.Every single woman in this Nation who today has the advantage of the capacity to command equal opportunity in education, and by extension in virtually every other field of endeavor, owes the impetus to that in modern times to Patsy Mink. She was one of the pioneers who transformed Hawaii and transformed this Nation. Her legacy will live on in every campus in America and in the heart of every American woman who aspires to greatness. Most profoundly, it lives on in my estimation in hope, hope for the millions of lives that she touched.Mr. Speaker, it is difficult for me to realize that I am standing here this evening paying my respects to the memory of Patsy Mink because my first memories of her go back to when I was a student at the University of Hawaii involved in one of her first campaigns, not for elective office because she did that when Hawaii was still a territory.She came back to Hawaii from her early plantation days, running around as a little kid in the plantation ditches over in Maui, encouraged by her family, most particularly her father, to reach for her star in the Hawaii firmament.She was turned down for medical school, discriminated against because she was female, because she was Japanese, because she came from an unknown territory out in the Pacific. That is why she went to law school, fought her way into law school so that she could achieve a degree that would enable her to fight against the discrimination she had suffered.She was a champion then. We all recognized it. She was smart and she was tough and she was articulate and she would not quit. She was an inspiration then and now.Whenever any of us felt some sense of discouragement, whenever any of us felt some sense of despair or feeling that we could not succeed, it was only required for Patsy to come in the room to change the atmosphere.Patsy Mink had the capacity to make dead air move. Patsy Mink, this little lady from Hawaii, was a giant in her heart and in her commitment. With every breath that she took, she championed those who had no one to stand up and speak out for them. A little lady with a big heart, a lioness. We will not see her like again. Someone will take her place here in the House, that is the way of it in our democracy, but no one will replace her in the hearts of the people of Hawaii. No one will replace her in the role that she played in this House of Representatives. No one was more beloved than Patsy Mink in this House.Mr. Speaker, as an expression of the gravity of the feelings of the Members of this House, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), whom I think has an opportunity for Members of the House to be able to express in a more concrete fashion the feelings that we all have for Patsy.",

I had not intended to speak much further because of the eloquent, articulate, certainly comprehensive manner in which the Members tonight have discussed the great contributions of Patsy to this body and to the Nation. But all through this evening, Mr. Speaker, I have been unable to avoid looking at the picture that has been down by the podium on the floor. That picture of Patsy really captures the essence of this tiny giant. You can see her steadfastness, her sense of perseverance, the stalwart person that she was on behalf of all those who had no hope.Mr. Speaker, it never occurred to me in my youth that I would have the honor and privilege of serving in the people's house, the House of Representatives. I look around the floor at my colleagues here. I see my dear friend Dana Rohrabacher and others here on the floor; Nancy Pelosi, who has just finished speaking of her friendship and love for Patsy, and I understand what it was that I knew intellectually so many years ago when I worked on Patsy's first campaign as a college student at the University of Hawaii when she first came here to the House of Representatives. I understood intellectually what it was to serve in the House of Representatives. But I am sure, Mr. Speaker, you know, as all of our colleagues do here in the people's house, that those of us who have sworn an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution in this house of freedom know what it means to have had the presence of someone like Patsy Mink.Surely, Mr. Speaker, there is no other people so fortunate as we, free men and women, in the freest country on the face of the Earth, in the history of the planet. No one has embodied more the spirit of this House than this gentlewoman from Hawaii, a true daughter of Hawaii who celebrated in herself and in her service the true spirit and meaning of aloha.Aloha means that our diversity defines us rather than divides us. In this world of adversity and pain and terror and cruelty and horror, Patsy Mink was able to stand for those who could not speak for themselves and was the living embodiment of what aloha meant not just for our Rainbow State, not just for our multicultural, multiethnic, multiracial people, but it gave the message of aloha to this House, to this Nation and to this world.Aloha, Patsy.Mr. Speaker, I believe that the time is appropriate to call for an expression of assent to the resolution before us, and if I could ask for that to be in the form of Members rising, Members and those present to rise with a moment of silence not only in commemoration of Patsy Mink, but to constitute passage of the resolution.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join in paying tribute to a great American. Former Congressman Augustus Hawkins was not only a pioneer in breaking a race barrier of the House of Representatives, he was also a pioneer in economic and unemployment reform.Congressman Hawkins was well respected by both sides of the aisle for his sincerity, dedication hard work, and commitment to helping those less fortunate. He sponsored numerous laws that created jobs and insured civil rights. He was a forceful advocate of Federal support of education.During his years in Congress, Mr. Hawkins' most notable accomplishments included the establishment of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978.Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues in wishing Congressman Hawkins a happy 95th birthday, which he celebrated earlier this year. it is fitting that we name a postal facility after Congressman Hawkins so that Californians and Americans can long remember his legacy. Let us not only look back at his accomplishments and his patriotism, let us look forward and wish him many more healthy and happy years.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for this resolution and to thank the leadership of the House for moving so expeditiously to bring it to the floor.I have had the honor to share the responsibility of representing Hawaii in the U.S. House of Representatives with Patsy Mink for the last 12 years. However, my first memories of her go back 40 years when I was a student at the University of Hawaii involved in one of her early campaigns. I admired her then and I hope through this resolution to secure for her an honored place in the history of this institution and this country.Throughout nearly 50 years of public service, Patsy Mink championed America's most deeply held values: equality, fairness, and above all honesty. Her courage, her willingness to speak out and champion causes that others might shun resulted in tremendous contributions in the fields of civil rights and education. Every single woman in this Nation who today has been given an equal opportunity in education, and by extension in virtually every other field of endeavor, owes the impetus to that in modern times to Patsy Mink. She was one of the pioneers who transformed Hawaii and transformed this Nation. Her legacy will live on in every campus in America and in the heart of every American woman who aspires to greatness. Most profoundly, it lives on in my estimation in hope; hope for the millions of lives that she touched.Someone will take Patsy Mink's place here in the House, that is the way of it in our democracy, but no one will replace her in the hearts of the people of Hawaii. No one will replace her in the role that she played in this House of Representatives. With the renaming of title IX as the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act, Congress secures her memory as a heroic, visionary, and tireless leader of this great Nation.",

    "title": "FUNDING HOMELAND SECURITY",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I would like to join my colleagues in urging the House to increase the amounts we will include in the supplemental appropriations bill later this week for homeland security. Last Friday I held a meeting in Honolulu of first responders to discuss preparedness, planning and coordination among agencies and funding needs. It became very apparent during the meeting that funding being received is clearly inadequate to undertake the job we are asking of our emergency law enforcement agencies and personnel.For example, the Honolulu Police Department has apprised me of the need for some $65.5 million for several projects that are necessary if the Island of Oahu is to be protected to the extent necessary. There are several important military installations for which Honolulu police have major responsibilities, such as Pearl Harbor Naval Base, Hickam Air Force Base, and Schofield Barracks. The Department has the responsibility for the safety of military personnel and their family who live off base, and to some extent on base. Specifically, communication and operability between civilian law enforcement and the military is essential. Additional personnel protective equipment has been identified as a need as well as emergency vehicles in a centralized equipment and maintenance facility.The cost for effective homeland security management is a huge, unfunded mandate the Federal Government has imposed on State and local governments. The Honolulu Police Department is establishing an Emergency Management Command and an antiterrorism unit. It is undertaking extensive specialized training in areas such as chemical, biological, and explosive handling. Joint exercises with the military have been conducted so that in the event of an emergency, roles are recognized and responsibilities are familiar.Our state of affairs and level of protection afforded to our citizens changed greatly after September 11, and has been heightened by our military engagement in Iraq. Our citizens expect and deserve such elevated security. But it also serves to remind us that protection is not cheap, and we in Congress should stand up to our responsibilities to properly fund the protections our citizens need.I would like to join my colleagues in urging the House to increase the amounts we will include in the supplemental appropriation bill later in this week for homeland security.Last Friday, I held a meeting in Honolulu of first responders, to discuss preparedness, planning and coordination among agencies, and funding needs.

Joint exercises with the military have been conducted so that in the event of an emergency, roles are recognized and responsibilities are familiar.There are other imbedded homeland security costs with which state and local officials are struggling. When the Nation moves to a Code Red Alert posture, the Honolulu police incur costs of over $1.5 million a day, about two-thirds of it for the protection of critical infrastructure for military installations.The Oahu Civil Defense Agency has identified numerous critical projects which total $18.1 million. Essential projects include warning siren upgrades, security cameras, computer software, as well as equipment and personnel training.These statistics are for but two of numerous first responder agencies. This does not include the fire department, nor the burdens placed on hospitals and emergency rooms. And the Hawaii State Government has separate and additional mandates and responsibilities.I'm not speaking today to point fingers of blame at anyone for the situation we face, but to articulate the need to provide adequate funding in the supplemental appropriations bill.Our state of affairs and level of protection afforded to our citizens changed greatly after September 11 and has been heightened by our military engagement in Iraq. Our citizens expect and deserve such elevated security.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that this House is marking Asian Pacific American Heritage month. For those of us from the State of Hawaii, there is something missing in this year's Heritage Month celebration--the dynamic presence of our colleague, Patsy Takemoto Mink. I would like to take this opportunity, therefore, to reprise the tribute to her that I delivered on this floor last October.We were devastated by the sudden loss of this irreplaceable woman.Patsy Mink was the first Asian American woman to serve in Congress. But she was much more than that. She was our friend and colleague. She was a true daughter of Hawaii. She was a person of enormous spirit and tenacity and inner strength. This House is much the poorer for her loss. We especially miss her wisdom, her energy, her readiness to fight for principle.As evidence of the high esteem in which she was held in Hawaii, she was elected over and over by the voters of Hawaii, and she was re-elected posthumously after she passed away just before the 2002 election.Patsy fought all her life for social and economic justice. Throughout nearly 50 years of public service, she championed America's most deeply held values: equality, fairness, and above all . . . honesty.Her courage, her willingness to speak out and champion causes that others might shun resulted in tremendous contributions in the fields of civil rights and education.She has earned an honored place in the history of the United States House of Representatives as the co-author of title IX, which guarantees equality for women in education programs.Every single woman in this Nation who today access to equal opportunity in education, and by extension in virtually every other field of endeavor, owes a debt to Patsy Mink.She was one of the pioneers who transformed Hawaii and transformed this Nation. Her legacy lives on in every campus in America and in the heart of every American woman who aspires to greatness. Most profoundly, it lives on in the spirit of hope, hope for the millions of lives that she touched. Patsy Mink knew first hand the power of hope, the power of perseverence, the power of dreams.She was turned down for medical school, discriminated against because she was female, because she was Japanese American, because she came from an unknown territory out in the Pacific.That is why she went to law school, fought her way into law school so that she could achieve a degree that would enable her to fight against the discrimination she had suffered. She was a champion then. We all recognized it. She was smart and she was tough and she was articulate and she would not quit. She was an inspiration then and now. Whenever any of us felt some sense of discouragement, whenever any of us felt some sense of despair or feeling that we could not succeed, it was only required for Patsy to come in the room to change the atmosphere.Patsy Mink had the capacity to make dead air move. Patsy Mink, this little lady from Hawaii, was a giant in her heart and in her commitment.With every breath that she took, she championed those who had no one to stand up and speak out for them. A little lady with a big heart, a lioness.We will not see her like again.",

I could not possibly even begin to do that. Forty-three years of my life was involved with Patsy when I was a student and supporter of hers, and then as a colleague. To say that the people coming down to this floor loved Patsy, admired her and respected her, hardly does justice to those words.There will never, ever be another person on this floor like Patsy Mink. When the history of the House of Representatives is written, she will be in the pantheon of heroes, those who exemplify the People's House. If there was ever anyone who embodied what it was that made this country great, someone who came from immigrant circumstances to the highest echelons of government, and never forgot where she came from and who she was and what and who she represented, it was Patsy Mink.She was more than a friend and more than a colleague. She was a beacon to all of us who serve here hope to be. We all take our oath of office here to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, and we are only here because of the faith and trust of the people in our districts. Never, ever, has anyone upheld better that faith and trust that our constituents have given to us than Patsy Mink. Patsy, you live with us and you live in this House, the people's House, forever.",

But I think perhaps not everyone recognized or understood until they came to Hawaii and had the opportunity to see from whence Hawaii Patsy came as to what molded her as a person.For the young people that are here today observing the remarks here on the floor, they may not fully comprehend what it was to be female and Japanese-American and smart and have to try and come up. We take a lot of these things for granted. She was in fact the pioneer, not just in Hawaii but throughout the Nation, for indicating what could be accomplished with those kinds of strikes against her. She turned that adversity into accomplishment. For that reason, if for that reason alone, she stands as the standard for which every young woman and every young man who comes from humble circumstances can aspire. With Patsy Mink, you had someone who was not just a friend, not someone who was just a standard bearer, but you had someone who set the foundation for all those who came after.",

I cannot see trying to kick people off the elevators who are citizens, trying to come see us, who operate in good faith, and we cannot get here to vote.Now if you are so anxious to get this thing done in 15 minutes or 17 or whatever it is, that is fine. I will do my best, as I am sure everybody else will; but, Mr. Speaker, you have got to see to it then that we are able to get to do this in the manner in which we are supposedly designated to do it.If you have elevators that are supposed to be for us during this time, then you are going to have to do things to see we can use them. I am not the only one who was disenabled from voting because I simply could not get down here. I could not get here fast enough because these elevators are stuck, and there are all kinds of people on them asking directions and you cannot get down here.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, on that point, or on these series of points that are being made, for all intents and purposes, the only opportunity that the American people are going to have to have these questions explicated is on this floor during special orders, and I want to indicate, and I believe the three of us are agreed upon this, we are going to be back. Arnold Schwarzenegger is not the only one that is going to be back.We are going to be back here on this floor. We are going to be asking the questions. We are going to be making the observations. We are going to be putting forward for the American people the opportunity to hear a perspective that is not necessarily or likely to be enunciated in the press, most particularly in the controlled press. We are not going to see this on the evening news. We are not going to see this in the so-called Sunday talk shows. They have the usual suspects on generally when that comes about.So what I want to do this evening by way of establishing some of the premise is refer back again to the congressional delegation that we made May 23 through the 27 under the chairmanship of the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), my good friend, our good friend, our able chairman, someone dedicated to the defense of this country by any standard of measure.Of course, there are differences of opinion that we have in the Committee on Armed Services on which I am happy to be serving as to what the policies might or might not be with respect to the defense of the strategic interests of this Nation, but there is no difference between us on either our desire or our capabilities or our abilities to try to discern what the best course might be. That is precisely why we went. We did not go there to try and get into a contest with anybody on an ideological basis or party basis but rather to try to find out what was taking place.Maybe tonight will be the first time people will be able to hear anything about what was known as the Organization for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, which has now become the Coalition Provisional Authority. These are important because we started out one way with a former general, Jay Garner, who has now been removed all of the sudden within almost days, weeks, in terms of workdays, just days, has been removed, and why? Not because General Garner was thought to be a bad person or an inadequate administrator or did not have the proper motivation or understanding, but because the mission to which he had been assigned and the mission which he expected to carry out, namely, a reconstruction effort, somewhat perhaps akin to the aftermath of a natural disaster, a dam bursting or a hurricane or typhoon or something of that nature, turned out to be a typhoon of entirely a different kind, namely, that there was chaos; that there was an inability to provide even the most elemental of protection for those who would be doing the reconstruction; that there was not an understanding and foundation in the population in which this reconstruction was supposed to take place that this was a mutually agreed-upon activity.There were forces in the street that were, in fact, trying already to get the United States out of Iraq, and therefore, we had to have the intervention of a very competent and highly professional diplomat, Mr. Bremer, Mr. Paul Bremer, who came in and assumed the authority over what has become the Coalition Provisional Authority. What did he propose?When we went to Baghdad to talk with him, he had put together what I called an outline. Some people would call this a plan, but I think Mr. Bremer is an honest and forthright person. I was very impressed with his desire to speak directly to us on the questions that we posed and the observations that we made. He did not try to finesse anything. He did not try to make anything into something other than what he thought it was. He gave that clear impression, and I think that was agreed upon by all Members there, Democrats and Republicans, who were there.He came up with what could best be characterized as an outline, not a plan. A plan is something that we know how to implement, we know who is going to implement it, we know where it is going to be done. We did not know any of these things. We still do not know these things. We are making it up as we go along. This is not an accusation, as the gentleman indicates, against Mr. Bremer. On the contrary he is trying to put something together that was not planned for.This is one of the key elements that we have to think about here when we are talking about we can have authority as General Shinseki said when he retired as Army Chief of Staff on June 11, you can be assigned command authority but you have to earn leadership.The question here that has to be answered by the President, by the Department of Defense, by Mr. Rumsfeld and others is, are they really exercising the kind of leadership that we need in these circumstances? We cannot equate a political policy with patriotism. If you are trying to tell me, and this is where I draw the line here, if you are trying to tell me that I have to agree with somebody else's political policy or have my patriotism questioned or have my capacity to understand what the strategic interests of this Nation are, then you have crossed over the line, and what you are saying in effect is do not examine closely, do not analyze to any great degree the policies that I am putting forward because if you do then I will equate that with somehow being antipatriotic or against our troops.If we are putting the lives of young men and women and the United States Armed Forces on the line, then we have to have policies that are worthy of the commitment and dedication and professionalism of those young people.I got into electoral politics because we failed to do that in the Vietnam War because we decided then that we would equate military activity with political policy, and the military activity became the political policy. That is why we got to body counts in Vietnam to try and justify our insistence on being there militarily, and so we have to account for the key tasks to be completed here in the context of does this advance the interests of the United States at this juncture, pending some further inquiry as to how we got there in the first place.And I will tell you that while these, in and of themselves, these 10 points of Ambassador Bremer to be completed, are worthy in and of themselves, they do not answer the question about what will be the role of the United States over the next 5 to 10 years, at least a decade.And this is where General Shinseki's words become ringing in terms of his retirement and what he said at that retirement about command authority and earning leadership capacity. He said that there should be no confusion about the argument over what the military should be doing or not doing in this country and what its role is going to be in the post-attack phase in the context of the guerilla war that is now underway in Iraq. There should be no confusion as to the commitment of the United States military to civilian control. To raise these issues as to who was in charge is dysfunctional to the discussion. But he warned us, and these words are going to be prophetic, do not get involved in a 12-division policy with a 10-division army.And what he was saying here is, were we adequately prepared ahead of time? Did we do the kind of planning that was necessary in order to accomplish this task? And was that mission that was outlined adequately underlined and a foundation established that would enable us to say with authority that the interests of the United States in terms of its strategic position in the world and whether or not we were facing imminent danger was in fact at stake? Absent that, then we are in for serious trouble. Because that means we will be engaged in essentially an ad hoc operation perhaps for over a decade to come in Iraq, and we will pay a fearful price for that in the lives and bloodshed of our American military and upon the taxpayers of this country and upon the credibility of the United States with regard to world opinion.",

    "text": "Well, Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield to me on that point, Ambassador Bremer was very, very direct in his characterization of us being an occupying power. And this was not said with any kind of bravado. It was simply an announcement of the realities that were involved and what his obligations were and what his responsibilities were in Iraq as the director of the coalition provisional authority.And we ought to get something straight here about this. When we say coalition, we are talking about the United States of America. That is who is in charge here. When the Americans show up, then people mean business. I remember that from the Balkan situation before. And just by way of disclosure, on that I opposed President Clinton on that. So again I point out this has nothing to do with Democrats and Republicans, whether they are in the Presidency or not. This has to do with credibility in terms of whether or not the national interests are involved and to what degree they are involved. As a result, I think that we need to understand very clearly what Ambassador Bremer's dilemma is and what is he to do at this stage when contemplating how to advance civil society.Now let us talk about the practical consequences of this. There is a reason that young men and women are being killed or wounded almost daily in Iraq today. We have no civil authority in place. When those who criticize those of us who were aware of this attack taking place under the terms and conditions and time that it took place, when they complain about, well, are you now ready to admit that you lost; that somehow we won and you thought we were going to lose. As my colleague from Pennsylvania pointed out, I do not know of anyone, certainly not any responsible person in the Congress, and I cannot think of anybody in the Committee on Armed Services that thought for a moment that the United States military would not succeed. We only have to observe them in action, as we have as recently on this trip at the end of May, to see that the professionalism, the capacity, the capabilities of the United States military is unparalleled.That is not the question. The question is are the politicians and the politics behind the military activity up to the mark. That is what is at stake here. And that is why we have the situation in which these young people are being shot, are being wounded, are being put in harm's way every day. There is no civil authority there. We are trying to stand up a police force.Does that sound familiar? It should, because we have been trying to do it since the late 1990s in the Balkans; and we are still, despite much more favorable circumstances in, at best, a very tentative dilemma with respect to whether or not with the NATO troops and United States troops leaving that area, whether or not chaos will descend once again. I will assure my colleagues if we leave any time soon, there will be chaos of a nature that the Secretary of Defense calls untidy.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield, that just goes to show that the interests of the United States at that time were deemed to be such that we could have that kind of diplomatic relationships with Saddam Hussein and the government in Iraq. The present Secretary of Defense was part of that, was in Iraq and trying to do business with Saddam Hussein.The question is what caused that change? Was it really in the interest of the United States in terms of our defense and imminent danger to the United States to attack Iraq? That is a question that needs to be answered because it is going to inform us and instruct us where we are going from here, whether it is Iran, Syria, North Korea, whether it is the kind of policies that are going to come forward on Iraq itself. This is the kind of thing that needs not just an emphasis but needs explanation.If we are going to have a policy worthy of the legacy of this Nation's triumph of democracy, we cannot simply assert it on behalf of other people, particularly in a place like Iraq which has never known it and whose entire history since World War I has been nothing but a division of the spoils among Western nations.Mr. Speaker, I simply want to indicate to my colleagues, and I hope that we will have a dialogue in the future, particularly with those who have different views as to where we should be going and what we have accomplished to this point, or what we have failed to accomplish to this point, because it is the only place that the American people are going to get any kind of a dialogue like that. That is what this House is all about. This is the people's House. You cannot appear on this floor except by way of election. You can be appointed to the United States Senate; you cannot be appointed to the House of Representatives. This is the people's House. We come up for election, as my wife says, every other year, not every 2 years. You can have a driver's license longer than you can have a license to be on this floor, and that is as it should be because it was the intention of the Founders of this Nation that the people in this country have the opportunity to decide who will represent them here against the House of Lords on the other side of the building.I would indicate that I will be coming back to the floor, and I hope to be joined by others because we do not intend to let this issue slide. We do not intend for anybody to get over this or get by it.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I want to assure our colleagues as well as those who may be observing and listening to us that we do not intend to make this a 1- or 2- or 3-time deal.This is not two or three Members of Congress off on some individual crusade. We are not here simply to recount those things with which we have a disagreement. What we feel very strongly about is what I believe is the views of the overwhelming majority of the people of the United States and most certainly those who have talked to me about that Members of Congress have not stepped up to the plate with regard to the discussion of these issues in illuminating what is at stake for this country, and that right now some of these corporation-controlled media networks and the organs of the executive government are controlling the message that is out there, and only free men and women, freely elected with the faith and trust of the electorate, the people have put us into these positions of trust here in the people's House.It is up to us with that kind of an obligation placed upon us by the people to speak out and to speak up, to speak forthrightly, to speak with as much knowledge as we can bring to bear, to exercise such judgment as we are able to bring to bear, and to keep the people of this country informed, and to let them know that we will not be silenced in this, that we are going to be back night after night after night, and that if we cannot get these issues discussed during the regular business of the day, then rest assured we will be here in the Special Orders that are given to us here in the people's House to make certain that the hammer of truth is going to come down on the anvil of inquiry that is required of a free people in a democratic society.We are going to return here again. We invite our colleagues to engage in this colloquy. We invite our colleagues to come forward and express their views. We invite our colleagues to come forth and make inquiry of one another so that we can be better informed ourselves, so that we do not have a circumstance that comes to fruition again in this Nation such as we experienced in Vietnam.If anything motivates me to be down here on this floor, I see parallels. I am not drawing analogies, but I see parallels, distinctly fearful parallels, to what took place in Vietnam in which we were urged to keep quiet, in which we were urged not to say anything for fear it would be called dissent, as if there was already an understanding as to what the correct position should be when it comes to issue of life and death as we face now in Iraq and other places where American troops are deployed.I believe it is an absolute necessity of democracy that we have the fullest and freest and the deepest and with the widest breadth of discussion that it is possible to have, and that is what we are going to be doing on this floor.",

While we cannot have schools built in this country, while we cannot have hospitals paid for, when we cannot get health care for our people, who benefits? Who is getting the contracts for this? Who is getting the no-bid contracts? Where is the money coming from? Supposedly from the oil revenues. Oil revenues then will be passing right out of Iraq and down to Texas, to Haliburton Company, to some of the other construction companies that are benefiting from hundreds of millions of dollars that are now being allocated into their pockets directly for this reconstruction, not in the United States but in Iraq.",

    "text": "Again in furtherance of what the gentleman from Illinois has indicated and others here this evening, these are the same questions that many of us asked of President Clinton. This is not something that has suddenly sprung into being. And they were asked in a bipartisan basis, too.My colleagues will remember that some of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, had these same questions for President Clinton with respect to Kosovo, with respect to the activities that took place in the Balkans. We had these same questions of ourselves as to what was expected of us. I think that as a result, what the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) has indicated is perhaps a start for us in terms of the questions that need to be asked, I think, needs a bit of reiteration.I find it very strange that when President Carter was in office, people in the media, particularly Nightline, would come on every evening, day 292 of the hostages and the number of hostages that were still in Iran, on day 292, three, four, five, 300, whatever it was. Yet we go now to casualties, deaths, we are not talking about those that are maimed, and this casual dismissal by some of the, I am sorry to say, some of the highest officials in the administration now of, well, this is all over, intelligence changes from day to day. You never know what it is from day to day, this almost sarcastic dismissal of these questions.There are young people out at Walter Reed right now who may not have been killed, a casualty in that sense, but they are surely there as casualties, with loss of limbs and a lifetime in front of them of having to deal with the pain and suffering of grievous wounds. Perhaps Nightline might take up this idea. It is day, what number, since the President said that the war was over.This is not something that we said. This is not something that other people said. This is something the President declared, and some of us have been challenged on our patriotism and challenged on our support for troops because we are not sufficiently quiet, because we do not acknowledge that the so-called ending of the war really ended.It does not end when somebody dies. It does not end when somebody is grievously wounded. It does not end when a parent or loved one has to try and understand and we have to explain when we go home why the war is over but the killing goes on and the maiming goes on.So I think we are going to need to have some accounting as to how many days past the end of the war the killing and the maiming goes on and what those numbers are. Because those numbers are real. They are not philosophical abstractions. They are not merely the recitation of numbers from an Office of Management and Budget or a Congressional Budget Office, some entity, some institution that has no reality to the mothers and fathers and the loved ones of those who have to bear the brunt of the policies that we in the government of the United States are bringing forward to the people of the United States as being in the strategic interests of this Nation.So I think that the questions that are being asked are not just questions about the past and how something happened but to try and understand what took place in the past so that we do not continue to make the same mistakes and the same observations that lead to this kind of grievous result.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, on that point in reference to what the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) said and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) observed to kick off this discussion, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) can see, his question was so pertinent that we have not gotten much further in it, and for good reason, because it requires some explication. The problem is here, if we do not do this, is a credibility gap. What will the President be able to say about North Korea? What will he be able to say about the Philippines? What will he be able to say about Colombia? What will he be able to say further about Afghanistan?Afghanistan seems to have disappeared; yet I know there were two attacks yesterday, one on the American base and one on U.N. personnel. I do not believe anybody was killed, but who knows? Now we are told there are more attacks in Iraq than necessarily are being reported. I suppose that gets quotidian now. If they are on the 11 o'clock news at night, they have got fires to report, they have assaults to report or basketball players or the latest boxer to embarrass himself or something of that nature. They hardly have time to fit in anymore how many people got killed today. It is almost a loss leader in the news.And so if we do not have some answers here, if the President does not take control and stop being dismissive of these questions as merely revising history or some other sarcastic observation, he is not going to be able nor will the administration be able to convince others who may find it in their interest to join with us in other circumstances. He will not be able to find anyone who is going to be willing to take us at our word. That is why this is so serious. It is way beyond partisan. Other people will occupy these seats down here. Other people will come to occupy our place. We are here only as long as the faith and trust of the people in our constituencies are willing to put us here. No one owns a seat in this Congress. No one owns a seat at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue either. We are only as good as the credibility with our own people before we can hope to influence others.",

    "text": "The question that you pose and was answered rhetorically with another series of questions, really observations by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel), I think bear answering. I think there is an answer and it is an unfortunate answer. It has nothing to do with plots and conspiracies, but it has everything to do with a philosophy and an attitude and an ideology which has been expressed again and again by some of the people that have been mentioned here earlier this evening. If you take a look at the spectrum of essays and books and articles written by those who were now in charge of policy in the administration, Mr. Krystol's book on the mission in Iraq, our mission in Iraq, Mr. Perle, Mr. Booth, some of the think tanks here in Washington, these nonprofit, untaxable think tanks that operate thanks to the tax loopholes that we have which allow them to operate and comment and infest themselves in halls of government. There are more than one set of interest groups in this town, let me state, and some of them are in charge of this policy. So the answer, I am sorry to say, in my judgment is this has been a clearly articulated policy of people now associated with the administrations who were determined to start a war in Iraq, to include Syria and Iran, because of the policies that they feel this country should be not only espousing but pursuing in terms of world domination beginning in the Middle East. So it is clear, even with the publishing of the documentation now over the weekend, that the bombing that took place for perhaps a year or more before the actual launching of the attack on Baghdad was following a pattern to try to knock out selected targets in Iraq before the formal hostilities in terms of an attack actually started. So I think I am forced to conclude, and this is why I think the idea of having an independent investigation committee is so important, I am forced to conclude that there was a pattern already being articulated publicly and in writing to set this Nation on a course of imperial attack beginning with Iraq. Mr. HOEFFEL. We wanted to hear from the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee), but it looks like the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel) has 60 seconds here. Mr. EMANUEL. I wanted to make two closing comments on my side on this point. One, I think we have a serious problem with North Korea. There is no doubt North Korea is on the verge of developing nuclear weapons, and unless America's word and its credibility can be trusted, our ability to muster the international community's outrage and capability to handle this will be questioned. Unfortunately, the President's State of the Union has called the question of our credibility and our ability to muster in the international community when it says this was an immediate threat. I think the American people, unfortunately, because of this now, are exhausted in dealing with the international crisis which we will have to do. Secondly, what I want to report and talk about in this group is dealing with the cost. We are paying $1 billion a week for the occupation of Iraq. There was a story two nights ago, four nights ago on the nightly news of how our troops are now organizing soccer teams in Iraq and sports in Iraq for the young.",

Because what we are doing can easily be dismissed by those who want to color it with a brush that has politics all over it, and that is not what this is about. It is not about politics in the sense that we are trying to make some particularly partisan point. I notice in the photographs coming from the rehabilitation wards right here in Washington, DC that the young men and women who have been grievously wounded are not identified as Republicans and Democrats or supporters of a particular policy or not. These are the people that have had to pay the price for other people's arrogance. These are the people that have had to pay the real price. We are not paying any price here. We all know that someone else will occupy these slots one day. I learned that the first time I was elected when I went to the office to which I was assigned and I realized they slid the names off the door.They were not screwed on, painted on; they came right off the door. We occupy that only so long as we have the faith and trust of the people of this country. That is what is at stake here. That is what this inquiry is all about. Is our faith and trust being played fast and loose with? That is the issue that is involved. That is why I want to say that as far as I am concerned, we are going to continue these inquiries. This Iraq Watch I hope perhaps can come out into the country, maybe off the floor of the Congress and perhaps go elsewhere. I would be very pleased to take this inquiry perhaps into a town meeting-kind of context anywhere in the Nation so that we can break out of the stranglehold on opinion that is taking place right now. We cannot trust the national media to do it. They are in the grip of the people who own the networks. We cannot trust them. We have to trust the people out there. And so I hope that perhaps with Iraq Watch, we can go elsewhere and go directly to the people, and we can get streaming on the Internet and follow through and let people judge for themselves on the people's network that is out there. Mr. HOEFFEL. I think that is a wonderful suggestion. Mr. INSLEE. A brief comment. I went and visited with two Marines who had some pretty significant wounds at Bethesda awhile back serving in Iraq. One was crushed by a tank and one was shot. I just think that those gentlemen understood the value of democracy and what we are here today is to say the Congress needs to understand the value of democracy, and democracy does not work where the executive branch of the United States Government does not level with its own people. I have one question for our next week that I hope we would have answered. Why did the White House in the run-up to the war in Iraq not seek CIA approval before the President of the United States went to the Rose Garden and charged that Saddam Hussein could launch a biological or chemical attack within 45 minutes as administration officials now say? That is a question every American deserves an answer to, and the best way to do it is through Republicans and Democrats working together; and I hope this commission does that. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his leadership.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, not only was that well stated, not only was the logistics of the politics well stated, but the sentiments expressed by yourself and by the previous speakers take us then to the question of what are we to do? The difficulty I think that has been faced by those of us who had reservations, if not outright opposition, to the attack on Baghdad, which is what the initial military activity was, because we feared that a war in Iraq would then erupt, one for which we were not prepared, I think the difficulties associated with the thrust of their remarks made to this point is that the American people said, well, where is this opposition, what does it mean, why are we not coming forward with it?We were drowned, literally, in the rhetorical excesses and visual stimulus of embedded media, following along with and literally with the troops. We were regaled with admonitions to support the troops by virtue of not questioning the policies that sent those troops in in the first place, and not analyzing the context and circumstances under which those troops were placed in harm's way. And I do not think we can avoid that any longer.How are we to deal with the analysis of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) regarding the circumstances under which we entered and what has taken place? How are we to deal with the questions raised by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) about the deficits, about the costs that are associated, the literal costs? How are we to deal with the elegant formulation by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel) of the juxtaposition between that which is required for us in the United States to deal with our basic needs and that which is required for the Iraqi people under the circumstances over which we now, ostensibly, have control and obligation? What are we to do?The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) and I, earlier this evening, engaged in a discussion with one another about, well, how should we address this question? And I think, if my colleague will allow me just a moment or two more, I want to posit what I think needs to be done or at least what needs to be done in terms of a dialogue.We established a governing cabinet which, according to The New York Times yesterday, is the Iraqi Governing Council. It says we have right now, and by we I am talking about the so-called coalition, because that is all it is. There may be some attendance on the periphery, but we have Great Britain, and we have the United States. Great Britain is now going through the throes of its own investigations and self-analysis. Who knows how long the Prime Minister will even be in office, let alone the support there. But it says we now have an Iraqi Governing Council, I am quoting The New York Times from yesterday, ``appointed a 25-member cabinet today to begin taking over day-to-day control of the government. The Iraqi ministers appointed today are to take over important portfolios in foreign affairs, finance, internal security and oil.''Now, my suggestion is if that is in fact the case, and if one accepts the premise for discussion sake that the motives for going into Iraq were sound, even if the process and the planning was inadequate at best, then this has been achieved. There was an attack on Baghdad. There was an occupation that took place. We now have a 25-member governing council to take over all of these areas. When are we going to bring the troops home?The same paper announces, the same news media announces yesterday that two U.S. military officers have died, another wounded when their Humvee hit a bomb along a highway in southern Baghdad. The military police brigade was traveling along a main supply route at 3:19 p.m. in the afternoon when their vehicle hit ``an improvised explosive device.''",

There are plenty of people who want to show up for work, but the work is not there because it is being out sourced overseas. Because we are providing an opportunity for the Vice President's cronies in Halliburton and all these other construction companies to send mercenaries overseas to make the big dollars off of the taxpayer dollar here.I want to see people at work in the United States.

Morgan Chase and company, was chosen to lead the newly created Trade Bank of Iraq. I thought it was going to be the United States was going to get some help. No, we have J.P. Morgan and 13 international banks, and they are going to put together something called the Trade Bank of Iraq.The coalition authority that I just referred to, the 25-member coalition authority which is now in charge of finance, according to the New York Times, in Iraq created the Trade Bank to allow Iraqi ministries to begin making ``big ticket purchases abroad.''This is all a corporate scam and the country has to wake up to the fact that we are utilizing our young men and women in harm's way in the military uniform of the United States to carry out the corporate interests of this administration, and that Iraq, if not before now, is a quicksand of corporate endeavor on behalf of profit-taking by corporations utilizing the all-volunteer force of the United States, and we have to take seriously whether or not we are going to allow it to continue.My view is, and I put it forward for consideration, that if we are going to deal with this situation straightforwardly, we have to talk about letting this 25-member authority take over. They say they are in charge of finance, they are in charge of security, they are in charge of trade, they are in charge of banking, in charge of oil, let them be in charge. Bring the American troops on out of there and let that Iraqi authority set the terms and conditions under which the United Nations will come in and help put this together.I am perfectly willing to vote funds because we caused this problem, funds that will enable the Iraqi people to get back on their feet, provided it is done in an international context at the behest of and request of the Iraqi authority which we supposedly have not only set up but now have in charge of these various ministries.",

I understand that. But the question here that I have raised here is what in fact is the role of the United States and these troops? How do we make it work? Let me put it this way, that is not an argument.In my dreams I keep thinking Thomas Edward Lawrence, where are you, come back. Lawrence, come back and tell us what it is we are forgetting.What do we think we can do when people made an argument back in World War I that the Arabs were not ready. This was a Western concept. This is people coming in from the outside telling somebody else that they were not ready. They were not ready to have the French divide up and the English divide up Iraq for their political purposes, but they were certainly ready to do whatever it was that they felt was necessary.I am sure that the colonial armies under George Washington were not ready. Cornwallis was wandering all over, wandering through Maryland and New Jersey, wandering through upstate New York; and back in England they said, We have got to get out. It does not matter whether they are ready or not. We are going to be adrift with our people being picked off one by one in the American Revolutionary War. We are facing the same kind of situation in terms of the material prospect for the military of the United States in Iraq today. It is not up to us to decide whether or not they are ready.Let me tell what one of the members of the governing council said yesterday. Abdel Aziz Hakim, the brother of Ayatollah Hakim who was killed in the car bomb, a member of the United States appointed governing council to which I have referred this evening told mourners, and I quote, and this is from The Washington Post of yesterday, ``The occupation force is primarily responsible for the pure blood that was spilled in holy Najaf, the blood of Hakim and the faithful group that was present near the mosque. Iraq must not remain occupied and the occupation must leave so we can build Iraq as God wants us to do.''My point is we are dealing with a situation in which we do not have the prerogative of decisionmaking other than what we do about ourselves and for ourselves. We cannot decide for others. If the argument was, and again I do not want to dispute that because we have Members on this floor who voted for the resolution, who did not vote for the resolution who had different ideas what that resolution meant or did not mean, that is not an issue. I have no intention of pointing fingers and extracting some kind of admissions about what might have been the true faith at the time.What I am saying is we now face a situation in which we have to make a determination whether our continued presence is a positive or negative force and what should constitute our continued presence.",

The toughest thing we have ever done since 9/11, which is coming up in a couple of days, the biggest sacrifice we ever made is not the inconvenience of taking off your shoes walking through a testing device at the airport, we postponed the Super Bowl for 1 week. That is the big sacrifice. We are supposedly in a total war. The President tells me that I am in a war, a total war, over maybe 10 years and we are going to go and we are going to conduct this war with every fiber that we have. We are not doing anything of the kind. We are watching the football game on television.When I see those guys out on the field, I see there is a kid from Ohio State, he cannot decide whether he wants to go to class or not. He does not know whether it is worth it. I do not blame him. They are marketing him over there. They are making a million dollars out of him. We are worried about whether some professional basketball player took advantage of a young woman and we are going to spend more money and time on that. They are all pretty healthy, it looks to me.

Why do we not have a draft if we really mean that this is a war against terror and this is something that we have to fight right through to the end with all the resources of the United States?That is what I cannot bear. I cannot bear the idea that we sit here, 435 of us that have been designated on the trust and faith of our constituents to try and make good judgments. We do not have a referendum in here in this country. This is not something where we just run out and take a vote on the fashion of the moment. We are supposed to be trying to use what brains that God gave us and what judgment we have been able to accrue over the experiences of our lifetime and, based on the faith and trust of our constituents, render responsible policies and obligations for this country. What I am saying is that these young men and women have volunteered for the armed services of the United States not because we expect them to throw their lives away on the political fashion of the moment, but because we expect to be able to provide them with the necessities of being able to carry through on the strategic interests of this Nation.I say that the strategic interests of this Nation now requires us to have an exit plan out of Iraq and to turn the question of Iraq and its governance over to the Iraqis as soon as possible so that they can make the necessary arrangements with the United Nations, of which we are a part, in order to aid and assist them.",

The exact quote, as a matter of fact, is that according to the Los Angeles Times, they said they would ``pressure other countries to come up with the additional funds needed to restore security in Iraq and repair its ravaged infrastructure.''

    "title": "RESTORING OPERATION OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN VETERAN HOUSING LOAN PROGRAM DURING FISCAL YEAR 2003 TO SCOPE IN EFFECT ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2002",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill to reinstate the Native American Veteran Housing Loan program.I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Mr. Smith, the Ranking Member, Mr. Evans, and the staff of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for their work in crafting this much-needed remedy to the present situation. I would also like to thank Senator Akaka for his leadership over the years on this issue. He and his staff have been tireless in their efforts to rectify this problem since it arose in May.In 1992, the Native American Veterans Home Loan Equity Act was enacted to establish and implement a pilot program to make direct housing loans to aid Native American (Indian, Alaska or Hawaii native, or Pacific Islander) veterans in purchasing, constructing, or improving, dwellings on trust land. Almost 11 years later, the VA has closed several hundred loans, and the program is a resounding success.Native Hawaiian veterans have greatly benefited from the loan program. Through the end of Fiscal Year 2002, 300 loans were closed throughout the Pacific. Of the 300 loans, about 215 were new construction loans, with the balance consisting of Interest Rate Reduction Loans. Although Hawaii has the highest loan volume, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam have significant levels of activity. About 100 of the 300 loans have been paid in full and the other 200 are active and performing. Only one loan termination has occurred to date since 1992.This year's dramatic increase in use of the program mirrors the national upswing in financing new construction and refinancing existing loans. Home ownership has long been a hallmark of financial growth and community stability, and it's encouraging to see so many vets in my own state enjoying this benefit. However, I deeply regret that more of our Native American veterans were unable to take advantage of the 40-year historic low financing rates available a mere two and a half months ago. The untimely halt to this past May cut off deserving veterans from this financial tool. Mr. Speaker, I hope that we can do better in the future to correct such problems before they cause inadvertent harm.In the end, this measure is about equity. The Native American Veterans Direct Loan program exists to afford our Native American, Native Hawaiian, Alaskan Native, and Pacific Islander veterans on trust lands the same benefits available to the rest of our veterans community. We need to sustain this program--it's a matter of fairness.I urge my colleagues to support this measure.Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",

That child's parents may or may not be paying the same kinds of taxes, contributing the same kind of financial support, that would be there if that parent was in fact living in that district as a matter of course in their life. So in areas where we have a high number of military dependents, the United States and Congress in its wisdom has evolved a system called Impact Aid.Now, the astounding thing that is taking place today is here are our constituents on behalf of military-dependent children appearing in our offices asking for funding, full funding of Impact Aid, inside the boundaries of the United States. We will pay foreign nations 100 cents on the dollar with respect to those children and their education, but within the boundaries of the United States, tonight as I speak, those children and their parents have to beg the United States Government for financial assistance for the children of our own military that are serving.Some of the same military that is serving tonight in Iraq have children in this country whose education is not being paid for by the Impact Aid to which they are entitled. This is the kind of disconnect that is taking place with the prosecution of this war and its aftermath that the people of this country have to come to grips with and come to terms with.",

These are the dependent children of people who are now fighting in Iraq, and those children and the school districts within which they are now living are not funded under the Impact Aid program that we ourselves have authorized in the Congress.If this is taken as the basis for our conversation in the immediate, I would point out that is one of the reasons why some of us are insisting that before any of this money be voted, that it be authorized; that the requisite subject matter committees, perhaps the Committee on Education and the Workforce or most certainly the Committee on Armed Services, have hearings on this to determine what in fact should be authorized, how much unexpended funds there are, where funds have been allocated, and have an audit of what has been spent to this point, what is expected to be spent, before we simply go to the Committee on Appropriations and in effect block the entire legislative process that has been established for every other item.The fact is that an appropriation, an emergency appropriation, a supplemental appropriation, should be handled only under emergency circumstances. These are not emergency circumstances. This is the result of what has taken place up to this point and needs a sober, serious consideration and analysis before we take one step forward.",

But the fact that it has to be passed, the fact that the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) has to take the lead as the appropriations chair to right this wrong is indicative of the fact that the administration has failed to understand what is at stake here. Surely something like this could be rescinded by an Executive Order. We are apparently able to go to war without the slightest recourse to the Congress for approval; one would think that the administration could rescind this tax on food for wounded veterans in our Nation's military hospitals.So I think the Congress has the obligation to get involved in this oversight in a way beyond that which is the ordinary passage of bills and the ordinary scope of legislation that we go through in the quotidian details of legislative life here in Washington. This is a perfect example of it. In some respects, it is almost shameful that the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations has to resort to a legislative bill to right this wrong, which is obvious to anyone who would objectively look at the situation.There is no doubt in my mind that the good offices of the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations is utterly and totally sincere and straightforward. The question is not the motivation of a Republican Member or a Democratic Member; it is that the Congress has to bring any administration, Democrat or Republican, to account with respect to how we fund things, where we fund things, why we fund things, and what the rationale is behind it.

    "text": "Madam Speaker, what we have attempted to do over these weeks is to bring the hammer of truth down on the anvil of inquiry, and that is the object of these discussions. People have sometimes asked me, and I know they have asked other Members, why is it that we have these sessions late at night during what is called Special Orders. And because we are used to it, we may take it for granted that everyone knows what that is. The people who may be perusing through the various channels on their television set may come upon C-SPAN, and they see the regular order of business is concluded for the day, and now we are in Special Orders.What that means is in this people's House, membership of which is restricted, restricted to those who have been elected, not appointed, elected by their constituents across this country, the faith and trust of their constituents have put all of us on this floor.We are here under Special Orders because this is our opportunity to speak to our colleagues and to the Nation about those matters which we consider most important and which we may not have had the opportunity during the regular course of business to discuss at length or in-depth. Unfortunately, as I have mentioned over and over again, we are dependent on the people of this country, on the people of our Nation, to pay attention to what may be said here, not because we necessarily know more than others, but because we have been privileged to occupy these positions and accept this responsibility and meet the obligations of carrying forward an inquiry for the Nation at large, so that we can determine what the best course of action is. Over and over, we reach out to the country here on this most important of issues, our Iraq Watch, because the media, and you see my arm reaching back to those who cannot see it, the galleries are here for a free press to join us, to observe us and they are never here. They are never here because they are occupied with those matters which they consider most important. They are chasing after a circus out in California, they are trying to determine whether or not they can start a fight, a verbal fight, some verbal fisticuffs between politicians, they are preoccupied with process and politics is entertainment. But that is not what our charge is, and that is why we are here at 11 o'clock at night on the east coast, not because we have nothing else to do in terms of our responsibilities and our commitment, but meeting our most important responsibility, which is to reach out to the citizens of this country to let them know that their Members here in the People's House are focusing in on those items not just of interest, but of most immediate concern to their welfare and to the welfare of peace throughout the world. And so we meet here tonight, and we meet here every week, determined to bring forward from our inquiry not just a measure of truth, but hopefully a sense of insight and to bring forward the facts, as best we know them, to let people draw their judgments.And so the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) has here this evening a chart. Maybe we cannot all see it on the television screen, so he is going to explicate for us what is on that chart, and what it means. The reason that we are doing it is because we have a deep and abiding desire to share with the entire citizenry of the country our profound concern that we are moving in the wrong direction. The fact is that there is no higher degree of patriotism, especially when you think your country is moving in the wrong direction and the price of that moving in the wrong direction is the blood and grievous wounding of our young people. We have to speak out under those circumstances, and that is why we are here this evening. I am particularly pleased to be joined as the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) indicated by his colleague, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Meehan), and a former president of the Connecticut State Senate and now the ranking member, the senior Democrat on our Committee on House Administration, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson), joining with us tonight. They are here, I think, at this stage to back up the issue, the issue at hand which is can we put forward a policy and analyze the circumstances under which these policies are presently being put forward by the administration, can we put forward an analysis and analyze these policies in such a manner as to give some direction that will see that this comes to an early end?",

That is how Harry Truman made his reputation. And when he was President of the United States, the Marshall Plan was free of that kind of corruption, free of that kind of cronyism, free of that kind of direction.I have a suggestion for the gentleman from Oregon: We now have Ms. Rice in charge of stabilization. I am not quite sure what she knows about construction. She constructs sentences very well. By the time she gets finished, a house of cards is still standing. I do not know how long that house of cards is going to stand, but she does her best to construct it.Now, perhaps she can do the same for reconstruction in Iraq. I do not know. But if she is in charge of that, presumably she will be in charge of the $600 million that is going to be borrowed and spent to find the nonexistent weapons of mass destruction.Perhaps some of the folks in the gentleman's district or State that are out of work can apply for a job over there. Not that they could do real work in Oregon on roads and bridges and schools, something of substance, but they can chase their shadows over in Iraq looking for nonexistent weapons of mass destruction for $600 million.",

It is not as if these guys were eager volunteers. Then I said we can pay them if there are going to be any payments made. Let us let them do the rebuilding of Iraq. Let them set the standard for it. Let Iraqis do the rebuilding. Of course we can assist them. That way we can get them on our side and not cause a huge fissure in Iraqi society; and, of course, that suggestion was ignored.I just want it on the record that the administration knew full well that there were Members who had reservations about the war but who, of course, wanted to have the best possible outcome once the attack was over, who made a suggestion that it was very, very important not to dismember Iraqi society in order to accommodate profiteering on the part of companies in the United States.",

The only thing that is stable, the only thing that is growing, the only thing that is expanding, the only thing that is a sure thing in Afghanistan is there is more heroin being traded for more money that is going to find its way into the pockets of those who are financing terrorism.",

    "text": "The parallel, and I am not one to draw analogies to Vietnam because I think most of those kinds of comparisons tend to be inexact and then you end up in useless kinds of arguments as to exactitude, but the parallels are there. You may recall the rather infamous phrase associated with our pacification policy in Vietnam. We had to destroy the village in order to save it. Now in order to stabilize Iraq, we have to take barbed wire and surround whole villages with it. So I think the question here is, at this stage, what is to be done? How are we to regard the war on terror and what the relationship of the attack on Baghdad and the subsequent war which followed it, how is that to be handled? How is that to be addressed by the United States?We are told, and again these cliches and bromides come fast and furious, that we should not cut and run. I am going to have to presume, I guess, that I know what cutting and running means. It means that you stop doing what you are doing and you leave. I do not know whether anybody noticed it or not, I certainly noticed, about November 15, that is precisely what Mr. Bush and Mr. Bremer concluded, that the United States was going to cut and run. That is what we are doing right now. The problem is that we are not admitting that that is what we are doing and we are sacrificing the Reserves and the Guard and the active duty military that is there now and that which will be going there to this continued failed policy without admitting what we are doing.We are turning over supposedly conveniently, just before the election in 2004, turning over, supposedly, the present occupation to a government in Iraq. If that is not cutting and running, I do not know what is. Are we going to turn over control, such as it might be, to some governing entity in Iraq, or are we not? And if we are, what constitutes that governing entity, this farce of an advisory group that we have there? Shiite clerics? The ill-equipped and untrained police forces that we have cobbled together? Or perhaps we are going to turn it over to this new paramilitary army made up of armed members of various political parties in Iraq. A paramilitary force.And we have the gall to turn to the American people and say, ``Well, they are preparing to defend themselves.'' They are preparing to cut each other's throats. They are preparing to fight one another, not just politically but with guns and bullets. The fact of the matter is that there is utter and complete political chaos in Iraq that is not being addressed by existing military policy of the United States.",

There is a bill going forward that hopefully will be signed on a bipartisan basis to increase the end strength of the armed services, the Army and Marines in particular, and I am afraid now we are going to have to include the Air Force. At one point I think if we had handled this, we would not have had to add the Air Force. Since 1995, I for one and others on the Committee on Armed Services and other interested parties have been urging, so this goes beyond the present administration.We are not trying to draw distinctions there. Since 1995, some of us have been urging an increase in the end strength. That is an inside baseball term in the Committee on Armed Services for increasing the number of troops in the Army and in the Marine Corps, because we could see the kinds of deployments that were taking place, whether it was in Kosovo, whether it was in Bosnia, in other words, in Eastern Europe, whether it was in the Philippines. No matter where it was and no matter what the reasons may have been, no matter how one felt about it one way or the other, the plain fact of the matter is that there was sufficient support to warrant these deployments, and we did not have the troop strength available to do it. We do not yet have a reinstitution of the draft.When people talk about the war on terrorism, most people are watching it on television. We are depending on a volunteer force to do that. What sacrifices have we made? Some inconvenience in an airport? Somebody running, as they did for me yesterday when I flew here, running their wands over your shoes? Having you hold your arms out so that they can check your watch? Examining your baggage? What kind of sacrifice is that? At most it is an inconvenience.The only sacrifice that we have made as a population since 9/11 is we postponed the Super Bowl one week. An inconvenience. That is the only sacrifice that has been made. This is being watched on television. This is being observed. We get the little tear in the eye and we get the flag being waved around those who are in Walter Reed or in Bethesda Hospital right now with grievous wounds. The sacrifice of the troops is not the point here. It is the sacrifice of those troops on a battlefield of corrupt political policy unworthy of the troops that are out there. And I tell you this, we cannot sustain with the existing Guard and Reserves that we have in this country the continual deployment into Iraq and still meet the necessities that we have outlined with respect to Afghanistan. That does not even begin to include questions about North Korea or any other place that United States troops may or may not be needed in the future as a result of some activity, other kinds of terrorist activity in other places around the world. We are not prepared. We are not able to engage in deployments with respect to terror in the rest of the world because of the failure of our policies in Iraq and our failure to understand the true nature of what was necessary in Afghanistan.",

I delighted to see you today.Mr. Chairman, as the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Force, I have the distinct pleasure of working with my good friend, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon). I do not believe I see him on the floor at the moment. I see other good friends from the committee.I wanted to express my personal appreciation to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon). His impressive familiarity with the details of the numerous programs under our subcommittee purview is one of the major reasons we are considering a defense authorization that correctly addresses the hardware needs of the military.Our subcommittee held many in-depth, rigorous oversight hearings on a variety of programs, and I think our adherence to a sound process in this arena has served our committee, the Congress, and the Department of Defense very well.While we dealt with significant programs in all services, this bill explicitly recognizes the importance of a strong Army. The Army has had an uphill fight inside the Pentagon the last few years, and I think the recent war showed how capable they really are.I am especially pleased that our bill does no harm to the future Stryker Brigades and that the committee was able to come to an agreement about fencing off funding for the remaining brigades. We have struck a blow in a couple of cases for better program management. I am glad to see that the F-22 cut its cost. We fenced further money until its software works the way as it is promised.The Army's future combat system may be a good thing. It is hard to tell because its budget structure makes it hard to evaluate. We changed that structure so that everybody can see whether the future combat system will work.We are working on some very advanced systems in all the services. I believe we have struck the right balance between future forces and our legacy systems. In funding modernization of our heavy forces, this bill ensures that we do not sacrifice the real combat capability today for the promise of capability in the future.I would like to conclude and I would be remiss, Mr. Chairman, if I did not acknowledge the hard work and long hours put in by our committee staff on all levels.Mr. Chairman, I would like to close by again thanking the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) and all the members of the various subcommittee with whom I have had the pleasure of working on this bill.",

What I am doing now for those who are listening and have an interest, it now is on my Web site. The Iraq Watch in its entirety appears.So we have a kind of cyber-archive now of what we are doing with Iraq Watch. And it will be interesting, I think, in time to come to go back over it and see where we were, where we were going. Not because we are standing here on the sidelines, merely commenting as we go along, but rather we are trying to stimulate debate, trying to stimulate discussion, trying to stimulate the body politic through the means available to us here in the House.We are the people's house. For those who just may be tuning in now, going down the cable channels and seeing C-SPAN, what are they talking about tonight, we are talking about our sons and daughters. We are talking about the blood and treasure of the United States. We are talking about the basic values of this country. We are talking about whether we are falling into the trap of a neo-imperialism, a 21st-century version of imperialism that would be anathema to values of the United States, the United States as we have known it and as we have wanted it to be.And in that context, I would like to read an excerpt from David Fromkin's new book called: A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East.'' Again, for those who, and I will repeat it at the end of my excerpt as well, David Fromkin's ``A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of a Modern Middle East.''And I am quoting:``Churchill, when he took office as Colonial Secretary [1921], brought with him a broad strategic concept of how to hold down the Middle East inexpensively. While he was still Secretary of Air and War [1919-20], Churchill had proposed to cut Middle East costs by governing Mesopotamia,'' which essentially is modern-day Iraq, ``by means of airplanes and armored cars. A few well-protected air bases,'' he wrote at the time, ``would enable the Royal Air Force to operate in every part of the protectorate and to enforce control now here, now there, without the need of maintaining long lines of communication, eating up troops and money.``Viewing imperialism as a costly drain on a society that needed to invest all of its remaining resources in rebuilding itself, the bulk of the British press, public, and Parliament agreed to let the government commit itself to a presence in the Arab Middle East only because Winston Churchill's ingenious strategy made it seem possible to control the region inexpensively.``Thus the belief, widely shared by British officials during and after the First World War, that Britain had come to the Middle East to stay at least long enough to reshape the region in line with European political interests, ideas, and ideals, was based on the fragile assumption that Churchill's aircraft-and-armored-car strategy could hold local opposition at bay indefinitely. In turn, that assumption was another expression of the underestimation of the Middle East that had typified British policy all along. It had shown itself when [Foreign Secretary Edward] Grey disdained the offer of an Ottoman alliance in 1911; when [Prime Minister Herbert] Asquith in 1914 regarded Ottoman entry in the war as being of no great concern; and when [War Minister Horatio] Kitchener, in 1915, sent his armies to their doom against an entrenched and forewarned foe at Gallipoli in an attack the British Government knew would be suicidal if the defending troops were of European quality, Kitchener's fatal assumption being that they were not.``In 1922 the British Government had arrived at a political compromise with British society, by the terms of which Britain could assert her mastery in the Middle East, so long as she could do so at little cost. To British officials who underestimated the difficulties Britain would encounter in governing the region, who indeed had no conception of the magnitude of what they had undertaken, that meant Britain was in the Middle East to stay. In retrospect, however, it was an early indication that Britain was likely to leave,'' unquote, from David Fromkin's ``A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottomon Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East.''",

Hundreds of people are dead, thousands of people have been grievously wounded.Speaking of the prestige that the gentleman referred to, that has been literally destroyed the world over. We now have the Secretary, the spectacle, the spectacle of the Secretary of the State now wondering whether or not he would have made the same recommendations had he had other information, at the same time when many of us here were saying, let us take a deep breath, let us be sure we know what we are doing. The inspections are working; the inspections were underway.We were not getting the information back that the administration wanted to hear. That is the difficulty. My memory is not in such difficult straits that I cannot recall what happened during those times. I realize we are now at a point that would understand only too well where inconvenient thought is shoved down the memory hole. We simply put it out of sight and pretend it did not happen. The plain fact of the matter is that there were cries all across this country, an outcry all across the country saying that the inspection process has not yet completed its task. We need to do that at a minimum before we go to war.It is one thing for people to talk about supporting the troops. It is one thing to talk about whether the definition of imminent is the same for everybody across the spectrum, but you cannot say that a political policy which has failed to do the minimum necessary before there is a commitment to war is something that needs to be defended in the name of defending the troops.Mr. McClellan or the President, neither Mr. McClellan speaking for the President nor Mr. Bush can get off that easy, nor can they claim that this is a situation that needs now to be explored in the aftermath of this tragedy.I submit that we are now in a situation that needs further explanation. My understanding now is that we have announced that we are going to be leaving on the 30th of June of this year. We are now in February. March, April, June. We are talking about in 100 days we are ostensibly going to turn over authority to somebody or something in Iraq. Is there anybody here who can tell me who is going to have authority, what institutional framework or structure is going to exercise that authority? I cannot find out who it is.Is it going to be United Nations inspectors? No, they have been told they were inadequate. Is it going to be United Nations observers or administrators in some form? They left. I understand that the United States now in some fashion is in discussions with them as to whether they will come back in. To do what? With whom?It is very interesting, one need only go to this issue of the New York Times Magazine for February 1, this past Sunday, and this article on what the Shiites really want. A quote from a U.S. official, ``We can fight the Suunis, but we cannot fight the Shiites, not if they organize against us. There are too many of them.''Is that what we have been reduced to? Is that what the policies are involved here? If you want to talk about imminent danger, how about the imminent danger of people demanding direct elections so that they can conduct their own affairs.This is the situation that we find ourselves in today. This is the situation that we have to confront. This is a situation that will not allow us to continue to merely stand on the side and observe the President trying to get the facts. He should have had the facts before he committed us into war. And he should get the facts now on what it takes in order for us to be able to exert such influence as we can in a positive way now that we have entered into this imperialist dream of imposing our authority on Iraq in the wake of Saddam Hussein's capture.",

I will tell you how a con succeeds. A con succeeds not because of the special insight of the one perpetrating the con. The person who does that, the con man, is not depending even on his own skill. He is depending on the desire of the other person to have the conclusion that they want to have come out. It is preordained they want the con. You cannot succeed with a con unless the other person is playing into it with you. They think they are getting something for nothing, or they think that something they want very much to be real is actually going to happen. You are going to win; you are going to succeed; you are going to be able to work the angle; you are going to be able to get something that somebody else does not have.All you have to do is look at the record of the desire of the advisers to Mr. Bush and their determination to reenter the Middle East along the same lines as I read from the Churchill imperial era, and to come back into with their version in the 21st century, they want those weapons to be there. They wanted to take any scrap of information that came in and turn it into proof positive that what they wanted to do and the policies they wanted to follow of going in there and having a war with Iraq was something that was substantiated by the information that they were getting. It did not matter that it may have gone the other way. It did not matter it was ambiguous, tenuous, or that it was fragments.What mattered was, is something was being said about it, and they were bound and determined to turn that into information which could be construed as being supportive of having to go to war. No matter what happened, they were going go to war.I find it very, very instructive that the Secretary of the Treasury's book that has just come out has been denounced along with him. He apparently has turned into an apostate, too, in the process simply by saying that these impressions and his honest impression as related in his book was that from the moment he entered service to the Bush administration, that they were determined to go to war; that no matter what happened they were going to go to war.So as we take a look at this and see what happened in the past, that, it seems to me, is prelude to the future. And so I suggest for our upcoming Iraq Watches that we take up the question, then, of what is going to happen on June 30; who are we going to be dealing with; what are the circumstances under which authority is to be turned over in Iraq by the United States; is this going to be yet another election ploy? Because the Bush administration is trying to use support for troops being synonymous with support for the war for election year purposes now, and I am very anxious to find out whether this transfer of authority is also going to be used for election purposes or are we going to actually be able to do something that will advance democracy in Iraq. I think we need to concentrate on that.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I have never seen a picture or any film of Mr. Chalabi when he was not smiling and when he did not have the smuggest look on his face and when he did not have the demeanor of someone who had pulled off a coup, when he did not have a patronizing attitude towards those doing the interview. I can understand why. He has played us for saps and suckers, and the result is we have dead and wounded, grievously wounded. The result is the sacking of the Treasury of the United States, and the result is that we have had people whose ideological bent in the administration was such that they wanted to go to war using each other, Chalabi using them, them using Chalabi, in the most cynical fashion, the result of which we now see before us.He said, and I remind Members and those listening to us, what was said before is not important. That which became the justification for what we did is not important. He got what he wanted. Those who wanted to have war with Iraq got what they wanted. They are not paying the price. They are not the ones who have to suffer for the rest of their lives either by having grievous wounds or by having the irretrievable loss of someone that they love as a result of this.The question for us and the question that we have to ask not just ourselves but the American people are going to have to ask, is, is this going to be allowed? Is this going to be something that we are going to pass off? The fact that the Newsweek cover that the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) referred to in his remarks just previously could have a headline, ``How Dick Cheney Sold the War,'' the crass indifference of a headline like that in terms of its implications, as if you sell a war, not that you are driven into it, not that necessity forced you to come to that sorry and reluctant conclusion, but rather how you sold the war.Nothing, I think, could be a commentary more persuasive to me of how this has been manipulated, how this has been maneuvered in a way that discredits this administration, discredits Mr. Cheney in that role. He has yet to come to grips with it, and the White House and the administration as a whole has yet to come to grips with it, because if my information is correct and the information given to The Washington Post is correct, and this is something that one would have the opportunity to see whether it is correct unless it has changed since its publication on February 22 was that the Web site for the White House, the White House official Web site cites the same false information today. It has not changed since March. I quote from the Web site of the White House as of February 22: ``The United Nations and U.S. intelligence sources have known for some time that Saddam Hussein has materials to produce chemical and biological weapons, but has not accounted for them: 26,000 liters of anthrax, enough to kill several million people; 38,000 liters of botulism toxin; 500 tons of sarin mustard and VX nerve agents; and 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents.'' And finally: ``He recently sought significant quantities of uranium in Africa, according to the British Government.''These are the same lies and the same fabrications, the same prevarications, the same falsehoods, the same misleading directions that took us into this war and continue to be repeated in the face of the knowledge that we know them not to be true.How could it be that these continue to be repeated? Is it any wonder that Mr. Chalabi laughs at us? Is it any wonder that he adopts a smug disposition when we continue to support him, we continue to pay him, we continue to support the policies that he espoused, and he is able to say what was said before is not important because obviously there are no penalties attached to it?",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I will ask to have the article that the gentleman from Pennsylvania is referring to entered into the Record as part of our deliberation.Several well-heeled Iraqis who hope to play central roles in Iraq's emerging government have launched lobbying campaigns in Washington to influence the Bush administration and Congress as they work to shape a permanent government in Iraq. The group of Iraqis, which include three members of the U.S.-created Iraqi Governing Council, are spending as much as $100,000 per month on lobbying firms and public relations agents to press U.S. officials to create a modern, democratic government that is not dominated by Islamic conservatives. ``It's like they are running for president,'' said one U.S. official of the competing public relations efforts in Washington. The three Iraqis began their public relations efforts in Washington more than a decade after another Iraqi member of the Iraqi Governing Council--Ahmed Chalabi--began cultivating close ties to now-Vice President Cheney and other key administration officials. According to forms filed with the Justice Department, Ayad Allawi, a member and former president of the Iraqi Governing Council, has begun an expensive lobbying and public relations effort to press U.S. officials to build a modern democratic government that builds on Iraq's existing foundations. Allawi has already paid more than $300,000 to Washington from Preston Gates Ellis &amp; Rouvelas Meeds LLP to help open doors on Capital Hill and at the White House. Allawi also hired a former U.S. ambassador to coordinate his Washington effort and a New York advertising firm that once worked for the Beatles to manage his image in the United States. The public relations effort, which could top $1 million this year, is funded by Mashal Nawab, an Iraqi-born physician who is a ``close friend and admirer'' of Allawi, according to the Justice Department forms. Adnan Pachachi, another member and former president of Iraq's interim government, has also signed up a Washington public relations firm to help him get his message across to the Bush administration and Congress. F. Wallace Hayes, working on a pro bono basis for now, will write press releases for the 70-year-old Pachachi that ``promote democracy in Iraq,'' according to the Justice Department forms. Meanwhile, Baqir Jabor, an Iraqi exile appointed by the United States to run Iraq's housing and construction department, has asked former Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.) and his influential Washington lobbying firm to help arrange a series of meetings with the Bush administration during his upcoming visit to the United States. Officials at Livingston Group said Jabor is not a formal client of the firm. Other details of Livingston's work with Jabor are not yet available because Jabor first asked Livingston for help only last month. The new public relations campaigns in Washington come as the Bush administration struggles to complete an interim constitution for Iraq by the end of the month in order to turn control of the government over to Iraq this year. In the past few days, it has become clear that the United States will fail to meet both deadlines. Over the weekend, the Kurds in northern Iraq--which comprise 20 percent of the country--rejected key parts of the constitution. Meanwhile, Paul Bremer, the U.S. administrator in Iraq, acknowledged last week that it is unlikely that Iraq will be able to hold an election for at least another year. By hiring lobbyists in Washington, the Iraqi leaders hope to one day play a central role in the emerging government. The Iraqis who have hired lobbyists are each former exiles who want the United States to create a democratically elected government. Iraq's Shiites make up as much as 60 percent of the country and are better organized than their political and ethnic rivals, the Kurds and the Sunnis. The leader of Iraq's Shiite conservatives, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, hopes to schedule quick elections, knowing that he and his allies would dominate the government if elections are held soon. Allawi, Jabor and Pachachi share another rival in Chalabi. But unlike the Iraqi newcomers to Washington, Chalabi has worked for years in Washington cultivating friendships with key players like Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle. Since 1986, Shea &amp; Gardner has represented Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress in Washington for about $10,000 a month. One of the partners at Shea &amp; Gardner is James Woolsey, the former CIA director. Chalabi also gets help from Francis Brooke, a political consultant, and Riva Levinson of BKSH &amp; Associates, the Washington firm founded by Charles Black, a long-time ally of President Bush. Those contacts have paid off: At this year's State of the Union address, Chalabi sat in the VIP box with first lady Laura Bush. Chalabi also was one of the few Iraqis permitted to meet face to face with Saddam Hussein in his cell in the hours after his capture in late December. Chalabi has long been considered the favorite of Defense Department officials to lead Iraq's new government. However, his star appears to be fading as Pentagon officials question some of the military intelligence he provided before the war and as Iraqis increasingly view Chalabi as a pawn for the United States. Meanwhile, the State Department is thought to favor Pachachi, while the CIA backs Allawi. His main opponent in Washington is thought to be Chalabi, a distant relative. Though Chalabi and Allawi both oppose an Iraqi government run by Islamics, they split over the structure of a new secular government. Chalabi would like to rid the country of anything to do with Hussein's Baath Party, while Chalabi--a member of the Baath Party before it was hijacked by Hussein in the 1970s-- believes the new government should be built upon the existing foundations. ``There are options available to make use of the civil structures that are available in Iraq rather than throwing everything out,'' said R. Paul Stimers of Allawi's lobbying firm, Preston Gates. Allawi, a neuroscientist by training, survived a vicious assassination attempt in the late 1970s when Hussein allies tried to axe him to death in his sleep. He later became a source of important--and sometimes suspect--intelligence information to the CIA. After the war, he was appointed to the interim Iraqi Governing Council and tapped to take charge of security for the country. In Washington, Allawia and his British benefactor last fall hired Patrick Theros, a former U.S. ambassador to Qatar, to build his base of support among key Members of Congress and the Bush administration. Theros runs a consulting firm, Theros &amp; Theros, with his wife and son out of their home in a leafy section of Northwest Washington. With a total monthly budget that began at $122,000, Allawi brought on New York public relations agency Brown Lloyd James Ltd.--a firm that once represented the Beatles--for $12,500 a month. For lobbying work, Allawi tapped Washington lobbying shop Preston Gates for $100,000 a month, though the firm has since lowered its monthly retainer to less than $50,000. According to contracts filed with the Justice Department, the firms will help Allawi ``gain U.S. government support for his policy suggestions for Iraq'' by ``explain[ing] his views on the security and political situation in Iraq.'' Theros, who is making about $10,000 a month from Allawi, plans to attend ``public forums, seminars, events and meetings which represent an opportunity'' to express Allawi's ideas. Allawi's lobbying effort was expected to end this spring when the United States was expected to hand control over the government to Iraq. But with the prospects of meeting that deadline dim, the lobbying and public relations campaign is expected to continue.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts. Again, Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman indicated, this is Iraq Watch. Several Members, some of whom voted for the resolution with respect to the attack in Iraq and some who did not, have been participating. The reason being that we find ourselves in a situation today where we are arguing about such things as budget, arguments taking place right now, both in the Republican Conference and in the Democratic Caucus. We find ourselves coming up on what might be termed the anniversary of the Iraq invasion. It is the anniversary. The question is before us as to what has been accomplished, what was involved; and I think, Mr. Speaker, I want to set a perspective before my colleagues and hopefully those in the American public who are viewing this evening.There has been an increase, both in terms of discussion and in terms of reporting about activity on the Pakistan-Afghani border. There is speculation in the press, speculation in our communities across this country as to the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden and his cohorts; a flurry of reporting taking place that there is increased activity, sensors being placed, special forces being brought together, strike forces, including Pakistani troops, American troops, CIA operatives. The question becomes this, Mr. Speaker: Why now? Why has this not been going on since September 11, 2001? Why is it taking place 6, 8 months before an election? Where is the justification for what took place in Iraq as a diversion from going forward on the Afghan-Pakistan border to capture or eliminate Osama bin Laden and his cohorts? What is the justification as we come up on the year anniversary of the invasion of Iraq of not bringing hostilities to a conclusion in Afghanistan and Pakistan with respect to the attack that was made on the United States?There is a cover here that the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) has to his immediate right from Time Magazine, with a picture of Mr. Bush facing himself, a mirror image, if you will, that says, believe it or not, Does Bush have a credibility gap? I cite that not because I am interested in what Time Magazine has to say by way of cute phrasing or what they consider to be a provocative title or visual, but, rather, that the question is one that needs to be answered as we approach this anniversary of the attack on Iraq. Why are we involved now in expedited activity and an expedited increase in intense activity on the Afghan-Pakistan border to capture or eliminate Osama bin Laden? What have we been doing for the past 2 years?Well, I can tell my colleagues what we were doing. We were diverting our attention from those who attacked us on September 11 and instead preparing ourselves and ultimately carrying through an attack on Iraq, which has turned into a disaster, an unmitigated disaster for this country. We have not captured Osama bin Laden, we have not stopped or eliminated the Taliban threat in Afghanistan, we have not come to a conclusion with respect to the stability of Pakistan, and we have created a situation in Iraq which is headed for political, economic, and social disaster. Mr. DELAHUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. I would concur with the gentleman's analysis. He is absolutely correct. We secured a military victory in Afghanistan against those, the Taliban, that allowed, on their territory, in Afghanistan, the training and a safe haven for the real enemy of the United States, the al Qaeda terrorist network. It has been more than 2 years, more than 2 years since we secured that victory. And as the gentleman mentioned, we were distracted, if you will. We were distracted by an ideological conclusion that the defeat of Saddam Hussein would create a new democracy in the Middle East.Would that it be so. But as my colleague has mentioned, not only has Osama bin Laden not been captured, and I have a sense he will be captured, and the sooner the better, and if he is not captured, may he be killed because he is the enemy of the United States, I think it is important, however, given the distraction, if you will, based on a rationale that was put forth by this President, President Bush, that Saddam Hussein not only was in the possession and had a stockpile of weapons of mass destruction, and it was suggested, if you remember, that the threat of Saddam Hussein's possession of a nuclear weapon was very real, was very real, according to what the administration was saying, in that Saddam Hussein somehow had this murky relationship with these terrorists who had designs directly on the United States, that this information has turned out to be utterly without substance.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I wish that I had a bit more faith in the idea that there would be a positive response to the questions the gentleman is posing and the observations that he is making.The difficulty is we operate in a parallel universe. The Secretary of Defense is going to filter everything through the medium of his own perceptions, his own self-delusions. We are not going to see this. This is going to have to be resolved in the political world in the United States.Let me offer this example of the parallel universe that I am speaking of. In the March 15 Time magazine, an interview has been conducted with the administrator, Mr. Paul Bremer. Asked, to ``whom exactly are you handing over sovereignty'' in Iraq? Bremer said, ``The spaces are not filled in. We will hand over to a sovereign Iraq government on June 30. The shape and structure of that government is not yet defined. When we get finished with the transitional administrative law, we will turn to a broad dialogue with Iraqi politicians, provincial governors, local councils, ministers, a variety of people to try to figure out the best and most effective way to bring in the government. We do not know what that is yet.'' I submit that is such a startling statement of complete incapacity to understand what it is that is taking place. That is why I say we are living in a parallel universe. How is it possible for the American people to have any confidence when they are sending men and women of the armed services to Iraq, putting them in harm's way as a result of policies of this administration? How is it possible for us to expect anything else but the killing and grievous wounding of those military personnel in such an atmosphere, in which the administrator on behalf of the government of the United States is saying, ``When we get finished with the transitional administrative law, we will turn to a broad dialogue, a variety of people, to try to figure out the best and most effective way to bring in the government. We do not know who that is yet.''The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) was not at hearings in the Committee on Armed Services that I attended. I asked the same question within recent weeks, Exactly what is it that we are doing? Who are we turning this government over to? What is the authority? And what is the obligation that we have and our troops have? What authority does this governing entity that we are turning over to have? What authority does it have? What obligations does it have? Do we have a status of forces agreement? And with whom do we have a status of forces agreement? And whom will enforce the status of forces agreement?We are coming up on June 30, and yet the press having asked these questions, at least Time magazine having asked the question, prints it as if that answer was good and sufficient unto the question. We are about to engage in a situation in which we are going to have a farce take place of a presumed turning over of authority with a president, will he stand up, I do not know if he will get on a carrier, but will he stand up somewhere on a field in Iraq and say, Mission accomplished too, because this government has now come into being?I know what a government is. I think I know what the obligations and responsibilities of a government are, but I have yet to have a straightforward, clear-cut answer as to what the relationship of the United States military, let alone the United States Government, is going to have with this new governing entity on June 30.",

We will get accountability, and that accountability will be taking place. There is both the request for it and the demand for it. And, in fact, we will have an accounting and that accounting will be taking place in November. That is how we settle things in this country.Not the way things are going to be settled in Iraq, I am sorry to say. Here is a headline from the Monday Washington Post: ``The Iraq council signs interim constitution. Powerful Shiite cleric criticizes new law.''Without going into all the details of the signing of this document by a hand-picked group of people by the United States of America, the observation made in the course of a discussion of what the Shiite council members would seek by way of amendment or an addendum to the interim constitution when that government assumes its sovereignty on June 30, quoting from the article in The Washington Post, ``Although the U.S.-led occupation's authority is set to transfer political power that day, i.e. June 30, it is likely to maintain a military presence in Iraq for years to come.''That is what we have to face. This is a question of deliberate policy. This is a question of judgment. And the judgment that is made by the American people in the voting booth is their sentence, is what they pass on that judgment. This is the conclusion that they come to.Our obligation, it seems to me, here in the House of Representatives, in the time allotted to us and in the arena given to us by these special orders, is to try to lay before the American people what the consequences are of these policies, these judgments that were made, and the consequences of the action taken as a result of those judgments.Mr. Speaker, the sad part about it for me is that the vehicle we have for this, once you are outside of the political arena per se, is journalism, is the various media, electronic, written and otherwise. They are the ones that are falling down. They are the ones not asking the hard questions and allowing this kind of situation to develop without any kind of adequate inquiry. So it remains for us to do it here.We have to have an understanding here that what is taking place in Iraq today is the direct result of decisions taken based on judgments made and responsibility that has to be taken for those judgments. The fact that no one has been fired, the fact that no one has been brought to account is something that should not be a shock to anyone. Nobody is going to take responsibility for this unless the American people demand it in the voting booth.",

Then you are going to understand what true isolation is, where you are bereft of any capacity to pay your bills, to meet your obligations, to know that you will have healthcare, to be able to take care of your elderly parents, to have some semblance of dignity.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) would yield, one can only have that kind of a dialogue if we can entertain a legitimate political discussion on the issue. When those who are trying to bring these facts forward, those who have this perspective are enunciating it, are in turn denounced for failing to support our troops, denounced for failing to want to carry forward the war on terrorism, as it is always referred to, are denounced for presumably being unwilling to face up to the cold hard realities of what constitutes terrorism and its origins, then it is very difficult to do as the gentleman suggests.I had the experience of having the Governor of my State of Hawaii taken to Iraq for purposes that are beyond my ability to understand, other than when she came back she announced that President Bush's Iraq policy should not be the subject of political discussion, that we should not politicize the war.Now, that suggestion is as problematic, I suggest to the gentlemen in turn, as it is unrealistic. Foreign policy and defense policy are always legitimate topics for political debate. That is how we do things in a democracy. Unfortunately, today we had a resolution ostensibly addressing these issues 1 year after the invasion of, or the attack on, Baghdad, as I term it, after which a war started. The voting public has every right to a full and open airing of different points of view.We did not get to do that today. We were unable to attempt to amend the resolution dealing with these issues. It is most particularly pertinent, I think, when we are dealing with the lives of our servicemembers and the Treasury of our Nation. The resolution that ostensibly addressed these issues today very firmly supported by the Vice President, as you mentioned who, by the way, in my judgment is the most sinister Vice President we have ever had since Aaron Burr, this resolution tells us that the Iraq policies are out of bounds for discussion. We were not permitted to make amendments or to attempt to pass amendments with regard to this resolution. The document simply amplified the administration's viewpoint, an election-year endorsement of this policy. It will no doubt be denied and is being denied even now, I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that this has anything to do with politics. In fact, it is blatantly political; it is transparently political. It is in-your-face political.Our troops deserve better than this cursory salute swaddled in suffocating layers of political celebration. Our troops have earned our gratitude for their patriotism, their courage, and their spirit of sacrifice, something particularly missing from this debate today.More to the point, they deserve a solid commitment for their well-being and the well-being of their families. This is something that the majority today refused to do and has refused to do.Last week in the budget committee, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Edwards) and others proposed some simple measures along these lines. I want to recite them to you: Tri-care medical service for reservists, a boost in the imminent-danger pay, improved military housing, higher pay for senior enlisted personnel, increased family separation allowance, more funding for family support centers. All of this to be offset by a modest roll-back of the tax bonanza that we granted to people making $1 million a year and more.What was the response of Mr. Cheney and his party? Forget about the troops. Our allegiance is to people making $1 million a year or more.I do not have any statistics, Mr. Speaker; but I suspect there are not too many millionaires serving in Iraq or going soon.",

But I will tell my colleagues this: as much as I opposed this attack on Baghdad and, as I termed it at the time that a war would break out after we made this dash to Baghdad which is, in fact, what happened, as much as I opposed that, we bear responsibility too. And I want to indicate to people that we are down on this floor not just because we need to hear ourselves talk; we are down on this floor because this Congress needs to be accountable too. The very questions that the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) has been asking, this Congress should have been asking. We should not have allowed ourselves to be pushed into doing the most profound and fundamental thing that any Congress can do and that any President can do, which is take us into war. This should be a lesson to all of us, including and perhaps starting with the Congress.The Constitution says only the Congress can declare war. When did it happen that we turned it over to the President to make his or her own decision on that issue? We have a responsibility, too; and I want to indicate to everybody, at least for this Member, and I think I am probably speaking for the other Members on the floor here, we intend to come back here, not because we are doing penance, but because we are doing oversight, the oversight that we should have done before. Maybe the same conclusion would have been arrived at, I do not know, I doubt it; but we should have been doing these things.No commission should be looking into this right now. The plain fact is we should be looking into it, and that is what this Iraq Watch is going to do. We may not have the benefit of having the President in front of us or Mr. Cheney or others, but we have the benefit of understanding what the revelations have been and what their meanings are and to search for the truth, and that is our obligation. And I hope that if nothing else comes out of all of this, that in future the Congress will take seriously its obligation and carry forward on the understanding that only the Congress can declare war; and it should be only done over the most thorough and complete examination as to what has taken place and what the strategic and moral interests of the United States are.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I think it is unfortunate that the discussion here has gone off in directions about what constitutes patriotism or what constitutes the proper recognition of the defense of democracy, because that is how all this argument started.Mr. Speaker, I want to indicate to the Members that this issue deserves a full discussion and not just on the floor. We would not be here and there would not be a motion to recommit, which will be made shortly, I can assure you, if we had a full discussion about this and then had gone, probably where it should have gone, to the Committee on the Judiciary, if it needed to go at all, or a decision could have been made as to whether that was the proper venue.I, too, can have recollections about what happened during Vietnam. I daresay that a lot of people on the floor, Members of this Congress, were not involved in any of that. I know what the first amendment is all about, and I do not think the first amendment says that the Secretary of Defense gets to decide what other people get to say or do in this country under threat of some kind of sanction. To the degree or extent that someone is prevented access that they are entitled to, they have recourse in the courts. That is what we do in a democracy.I do not notice that it is our job, certainly not in the Committee on Armed Services, to turn over to the Secretary of Defense, any Secretary of Defense, the opportunity to be a prosecutor and a judge and a jury and a sheriff all at the same time.Now, the facts are, as to the origin of this argument today, that there apparently have been instances in which people disagreed, apparently in some law schools in particular, disagreed with the ``don't ask/don't tell policy'' of the United States Armed Forces. This has nothing to do with what people said or did not say about the Vietnam War. It has nothing to do with what any particular Member's view of that American involvement in the Vietnam war was, let alone the war on terror or anything else. What it has to do is with the present policy, whether you agree with it or not, with the armed services.Now, if the Armed Services say they want equal access, what was being said apparently by the people at these various schools was that they did not have equal access to being able to join the Armed Services or the Department of Homeland Security, I suppose, or the CIA. Now that needs to be discussed, and it is not going to be discussed in 3 minutes or 5 minutes or 2 minutes here on the floor. It is not even going to come up.Now I could not find the proper way to make a motion to try to get this before the Committee on the Judiciary so we could have a discussion on what the proper sanctions might be, if they were needed at all, with respect to gaining access for the ROTC or anybody else that want to recruit. I am in favor of that. Those of us who oppose this bill are in favor of it.I resent on proper grounds here in the House being categorized as someone who somehow wants to thwart the war on terrorism or does not have the correct view on the Vietnam War because I am trying to defend the first amendment and because I would like to see these discussions held in a manner and in a place and in a venue which is appropriate to the circumstances. We need to talk about such issues as to whether everybody in this country is going to be treated equally with respect to being able to join the military or participate in the Department of Homeland Security or defend our security interests through the CIA and whether they can be hired on the basis of their ability and what they have to offer rather than on what they look like or what their sexual orientation is or anything else. This is not the bill to do it, and it is certainly not the Secretary of Defense who should be doing it.So what I am asking here is that the Members try to exercise some common sense, some common legislative sense, give us an opportunity to take up this serious issue, which does need addressing, and address it in a manner that will resolve it under constitutional methodology that is worthy of this body.",

That is the reason the bill is on the floor.I realize a lot of Members and their staffs are listening to this discussion in their offices, and they cannot be on the floor because they have other duties; but I am asking them to pay attention to why the bill is on the floor. This bill gives the Secretary of Defense the basis. We are creating another problem instead of solving the problem which is really before us, which is access for ROTC and/or military and other recruiters. If Harvard or any other school is preventing them from coming on, is there no access to the courts? You mean no law exists in the United States to allow people to have proper access? Of course it exists.The reason for this bill is to make the Secretary of Defense the arbiter of how this is going to take place, even up to the point of getting certification from the school that the Secretary of Defense is satisfied that equal access, et cetera, is going to be provided.My point is that we are doing this all wrong. If we really want to solve this issue of openness and access and discussion that needs to be taking place and to have the ROTC or the CIA or the Homeland Security Department or whoever it is have access and dialogue and discussion on a civilized basis as to how it should take place, that is available to us. This is not the way to do it. This bill merely enables the Secretary of Defense to be judge and jury over that process, and it will generate a whole new slew of lawsuits that will not solve the question nor even address the question that is before us as to how do we achieve this access. I want that access.I think it is very unfortunate that the bill is being posited to the body in such a manner that those of us who oppose it seem to be in favor of terrorism or approving arbitrary dislocation of legitimate endeavors to recruit for the ROTC or anybody else. That is not true. On the contrary, I raised the issue in the Committee on Armed Services precisely on the point that I am a libertarian on the issue of free speech and access, and I believe everybody should engage in dialogue and confrontation of the issues in a positive way that gives everybody a chance.The reason the argument takes place in the first place is that people who are defending those who are prevented from having access to the armed services, apparently those who are gay or lesbian or transgender or whatever other category we are getting into these days, I cannot keep up with every permutation that apparently exists in terms of gender and sexual orientation, but that is not a reason to make the Secretary of Defense the arbiter of it. I do not think, despite his great wit and great perception and depth of interest in world history and events, that the Secretary of Defense is necessarily up on all the latest in transgender fashions. And so I do not think that this is a proper forum nor a proper venue to try and resolve this issue.My request, Mr. Speaker, of the body is that we give a chance for a motion to recommit to be made so that we can address the issue of access as opposed to addressing the issue which the bill moves toward giving a basis for the Secretary of Defense to make this decision. Let us not confuse the access apple with the orange of the first amendment of the Constitution.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, as was indicated by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Meehan), the previous speaker, I think all we would like to have here and the reason for recommittal motion is to have some hearings. As the chairman, and I do not if he is still on the floor or not, the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services Committee knows, I have the greatest respect for him and the greatest respect for the bipartisanship that exists on the Committee on Armed Services.The issue here and the only reason this bill is on the floor is that a court determined that the Secretary of Defense did not have a basis in law for being able to make some of the kinds of decisions which the bill in front of us allows the Secretary to make. The issue involved here is one of access. It is one of equal treatment. The arguments of whether one accepts them or do not accept them have been made that the armed services, I suppose by extension of the bill, the Department of Homeland Security, the CIA, are not allowing equal access to every American and at least in some instances on the basis of their sexual orientation. There may be other issues that are raised in that regard, too. That is worthy of discussion, surely. Whether or not then this bill constitutes a proper response to that difficulty to the degree that it exists is the issue.The reason I am asking for a vote on recommittal with instructions is not because I oppose or anyone else, I believe, opposes equal access either for recruitment purposes or other purposes of discussion and dialogue but rather that this bill does not address that fundamental issue and, in fact, will only engender a new series of lawsuits and it will fail to accomplish that which is really the bottom-line, fundamental issue here before us, which is how do we appropriately address the first amendment in the context of recruitment, whether it is for a Federal Government agency of any kind, let alone whether or not the Secretary of Defense should be the arbiter in that regard.So, Mr. Speaker, with that I am asking that the body vote to recommit with instructions so that we can properly address this serious issue.Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",

Well, does the gentleman recall that while we were unable to prevent looting, mass looting not just of the Baghdad museums, the history of the entire Middle East, really the Mesopotamian history there, but unable to stop looting in virtually every area of Baghdad and throughout Iraq, hospitals, schools, businesses, everywhere, was it not interesting the Oil Ministry was guarded? And I wonder how that took place. I wonder what the emphasis was.Would the gentleman be interested in a story from USA Today of March 29, Monday, as follows: ``In 2002, troops from the Fifth Special Forces group who specialize in the Middle East were pulled out of the hunt for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan to prepare for their next assignment in Iraq. Their replacements were troops with expertise in Spanish cultures. The CIA was stretched badly in its capacity to collect, translate, and analyze information coming from Afghanistan. When the White House raised a new priority, it took specialists away from Afghanistan in an effort to ensure Iraq was covered.''USA Today added, ``Those were just two of the trade-offs required because of what the Pentagon and the CIA acknowledged is a shortage of key personnel to fight the war on terrorism,'' not the engagement in Iraq, the war on terrorism that we hear about all the time. ``The question of how much those shifts prevented progress against al Qaeda and the other terrorists is putting the Bush administration on the defensive.''Troops with the capacity to hunt Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan were removed and sent to Iraq. Now I believe the gentleman will observe there is a renewed emphasis on catching and capturing or killing Osama bin Laden, as if this had been put into limbo for some period of time.I wonder if the gentleman would observe, as I do, that there may be more than a coincidence here with respect to what he has just been sharing with us?",

We can see what the results are.I would quote to the gentleman from the Financial Times of Monday, a report which indicated that a United Nations body will warn this week that Afghanistan is in danger of reverting to a ``terrorist breeding ground.'' That is the phrase utilized in the Financial Times story characterizing the United Nations' report, that Afghanistan is in danger of reverting to a terrorist breeding ground with an economy dependent on the illegal drug trade, unless the international community significantly increases development funding for the war-torn country.Now, we have billions and billions and billions, tens of billions of dollars to be expended in Iraq at the present time with its economy in collapse, except, we are told, for its ability to produce oil. The economy in Afghanistan is now reverting to the pre-Taliban days. If the gentleman will recall, we supported the Taliban to the tune of $40 million because it was involved in eradicating the drug trade. The drug trade has come back with a vengeance. It is now supplying funding in the absence of any international effort being made in Afghanistan and, as a result of the switch in emphasis on terrorism from Afghanistan to Iraq, particularly in the wake of what I contended to the gentleman at the beginning of my statement that it was deliberate. It is not incomprehensible if it is a deliberate policy of the administration to find a methodology of presentation to the country sufficient to raise the fear factor to a level that would allow this invasion to take place. That was the purpose and the intent all along, and the result that the administration has to be held to account for is that Afghanistan now is reverting to a status in which it could be called a terrorist breeding ground in a United Nations report.",

Members may be familiar with the program Marketplace. It is on the radio and follows the National Public Radio news, All Things Considered, the afternoon edition of it. There is a business broadcast called Marketplace which reviews the market decisions, the business activities of the country, and in their series entitled The Spoils of War, Members will find that the money which otherwise might have been spent, according to the contract that your company represents, to provide armor for the Humvees is now going out at the rate of tens of millions of dollars a week, perhaps a month, in graft and corruption through the Bank of Iraq, with nothing in the way of any kind of accountability under the Provisional Authority, Mr. Bremer's Provisional Authority.This is being done today. They are done with DGs, or director generals, of the various Iraqi ministries. They are the equivalent of under secretaries. They go into the bank and walk out with cardboard boxes full of cash. Corruption is in the hands of clerks who simply rubber-stamp the action, and the American companies that are over there taking the money are paying bribes, are involved in mass corruption, and this is where the money is going. This is what the Provisional Authority is involved in. This is what is happening.We cannot respond to you and your constituents in Ohio and those people in Ohio who are capable of providing armor for our troops because we have to make sure that those who say they were on our side, those who say they were the sources of Iraqi information and intelligence and upon whom we could rely are the very ones who are involved up to their eyeballs in corruption and graft in Iraq and Baghdad itself to the detriment of our own troops' capacity to be able to defend themselves.",

    "text": "In that context, I can tell Members as someone who was part of the first group to go into Iraq right after the initial attack on Baghdad, going from the Baghdad airport to Saddam Hussein's palace where Mr. Bremer was being installed and displacing General Garner, and we were there the day after he had taken control there, we said to him at that time, you can have all of the equipment in the world, but as I said to him, Mr. Ambassador, driving from the Baghdad airport to Baghdad itself and to this palace that we now occupy, you are going to have to have 10,000 soldiers who guard that highway. I do not care what kind of equipment and armor you have, you do not arm a Humvee and then send somebody out to play lottery with their lives. No matter what the equipment is, when you only have a strip of tar coming across the desert, no lights, no protection, nothing, I said it is going to take 10,000 soldiers.The plain fact of the matter is when General Shinseki, who had responsibility for the well-being of his soldiers, indicated as chief of the Army that it would take hundreds of thousands of soldiers, hundreds of thousands of Army and Marine personnel and support in order to initiate and sustain such an attack and deal with the aftermath, he was entirely correct. We need not just more equipment, we need a political policy that provides a foundation to bring this to a resolution.And in order to accomplish that, we have to have sufficient personnel unto the date, and the Secretary of Defense and the President consistently have denied this to our people in the field and indicated to me shamefully all along if they wanted more, all they have to do is ask. We know what the message is. The message is they are not here; they cannot be there. And why? I will tell the Members. Because many members of our committee, Republican and Democrat alike, and when I say our committee, the Committee on Armed Services, have tried for several years now to increase the number of people in the Army and the Marine Corps, that is to say that can be recruited and retained as active-duty forces. It is called end strength. What is the end strength? The end of the numbers that we have in the Armed Forces. We said, absent a significant increase in the number of Army troops and Marines available, we inevitably would have to call on Guard and Reserve.I beg to differ with the gentleman's remarks and the gentlewoman's remarks in one sense only, the phrase ``our young men and women.'' Let me tell my colleagues something. Tune into the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer every night on PBS, and respectfully and with dignity they close every program in silence with the pictures and short biographies of the people who have been killed, and chills run down my arm as I reach out to say it, and we see over and over again sergeant so and so, 43 years old; master sergeant somebody, 50-something years old; 38 years old. These are teachers. These are police officers. These are fire fighters. These are Guard and Reservists. They are not young men and women. Not that being young in itself makes one a candidate for these pictures, but that is who we tend to think of. This is a volunteer force, and the Guard and Reverses are volunteers, and they are being shamelessly exploited in this sense. We now have a draft in this country. We have a draft by default because the Guard and Reserve are being pulled into active-duty service and their terms of enlistment are being extended arbitrarily by the Department of Defense.Therefore, I conclude, and thank the gentleman for yielding, by saying, yes, we have to provide the equipment; but we have to provide the people and the policy behind it that will allow us to resolve this issue.",

    "text": "If the gentleman would yield, both he and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) have made the point over the last several minutes that a lack of planning, a lack of clear-sighted planning has brought us to the present path.I would like to cite an article in The Washington Post for summary purposes made just yesterday. At the confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, where Mr. John Negroponte, Mr. Bush's nominee to be ambassador to Iraq, was being questioned, the summary in the story by Walter Pincus and Colum Lynch is as follows: ``Panel members expressed confidence in Negroponte while voicing skepticism that the United States had a clear enough strategy in place for Iraq.''Let me be a little more specific, specific in the words of Mr. Negroponte with respect to his assuming the ambassadorship in Iraq and planning for what is going to happen to our troops and what is going to happen to Iraq in terms of its sovereignty: Under questioning by Senator Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, when asked what would happen if there was disagreement between Iraqi authorities and the United States military over how to handle a situation similar to the unrest in Fallujah, that would require, ``a real dialogue between our military commanders, the new Iraqi government, and, I think, the United States mission as well,'' Negroponte said. Think about that. Can you imagine a combat situation such as is faced right now in Fallujah. It has nothing to do with the competence or incompetence of the United States military; it has everything to do with the competence or incompetence of the political policies that put the military in that situation. We are now faced with circumstances in which military action becomes the political policy, that in order to support the political policy, you have to support military action, whatever it might be.Going on, in the end, however, Negroponte said, ``The U.S. military is going to have the freedom to act in their self-defense, and they are going to be free to operate in Iraq as they best see fit.'' Operate in their self-defense.Mr. Negroponte, perhaps unconsciously, recognizes we are not on the offense.We are not accomplishing any mission. What we are saying is, what I have said on this floor, that on June 30, the United States military is going to set adrift in a desert sea of political anarchy where our military action will be self-defense. Is that what we are sentencing the United States military to? A daily round of defending itself? For what? Under what circumstances can we justify the continued presence of the United States military if their sole military purpose according to the ambassador nominee to Iraq is to defend themselves?Continuing, what is more, he said, Iraqi military forces ``will come under the unified command of a U.S.-led multinational force. Negroponte emphasized the interim government will not need law-making authority because it will just have two prime functions: running 25 government ministries and preparing for next year's election of a transitional national assembly. Among the most sensitive aspect of the U.S. transition plan has been what has been called the transitional administration law devised by the United States and its appointed Iraq governing council.''At the White House yesterday, Mr. Scott McClellan, the press secretary, told reporters, and I am quoting from the article ``that an annex to the transitional law is being written that will limit the interim government's power.''",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I come before the House this evening in this special order representing those of us who have participated in what we have termed ``Iraq Watch.''For some period of time now, several of us have come before this House to try to analyze in a hopefully dispassionate way but in an informative way what is taking place in Iraq and what the implications are for us here in the House of Representatives, and by extension for the Nation in terms of the political ramifications.I come here tonight by myself because the other members of Iraq Watch, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel), the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Strickland), the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee), and others who have joined us periodically are otherwise occupied this evening. But I come here representing those who have participated because of the seriousness of the issues that are now confronting us with respect to Iraq.I have before me, Mr. Speaker, a copy of the May 3, 2004, issue of the New Yorker Magazine entitled ``Torture at Abu Ghraib.'' I cite this, Mr. Speaker, because I am afraid we are going to hear this phrase on more than one occasion in the days to come. It is written by Seymour Hersh, subtitled ``American Soldiers Brutalized Iraqis, How Far Up Does the Responsibility Go?'' I am citing this to the Members this evening, Mr. Speaker, because this is the only comprehensive report that I, as a member of the Committee on Armed Services, and as a Member of the House, have been able to get. I was intrigued by it because it mentions two reports. The speaker before me, the gentleman from New York, mentioned a report written by Major General Antonio Taguba, who happens to be by coincidence from Hawaii, but he did not mention nor have many other venues that I have observed, television, radio, newspapers, articles, et cetera, another report. The report from General Taguba being completed in February of this year, but that followed on a report that was written and submitted in November of last year, November of 2003, by the Provost Marshal of the Army, the chief law enforcement of the Army, General Provost Marshal Donald Ryder.I think that I can begin to account for the tone, at least the summary of the tone as far as it has been delivered to us, which is one of outrage. I withdraw that. That is my characterization.But let me put it this way: I believe it is fair to say if Mr. Hersh's summary is correct, that General Taguba's report was, at a minimum very, very intense, and that Mr. Hersh stated as follows: Its conclusions about institutional failures in the Army prison system were devastating. I think that is a fair summary.The reason I am citing this to you, Mr. Speaker, is that at a meeting this afternoon, at a briefing this afternoon, convened under the direction of the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, under his auspices, officers appeared. Given the nature of the hearing, the secret nature of the hearing, again, for good and sufficient reason, I cannot cite to you and will not cite to you the exact dialogue that took place, nor those who were involved in it.But, suffice to say, it was confirmed to me in that hearing, I should say in that briefing, that there was indeed a report given to General Sanchez, the Supreme Commander in Iraq, in November of last year, and that General Ryder, according to Mr. Hersh, indicated in November, and this is important. The reason we are going through this now and the reason I am going through this recitation is these incidents did not just happen. They did not just appear out of nowhere.This is not something that the Army was aware of only in February of this year, that there was some kind of shock recognition by the Army that this was taking place in February. Because General Ryder clearly warned, quoting now from the Hersh article, ``that there were potential human rights training and manpower issues system-wide that needed immediate attention.''It also discussed serious concerns about the tension between the missions of the military police assigned to guard the prisoners and intelligence teams who wanted to interrogate them.Again, I will go on, another quotation: ``Army regulations limit intelligence activities by MPs to passive collection.''I think this is an important point, because I see some of these National Guard people who have been identified and who have had their pictures on television and are being pointed out and being looked to for responsibility. I think it is important for those who may not be familiar with the situation in prisons, Army prisons, military prisons, that Army regulations limit intelligence activities of MPs to passive collection.Something obviously went awry here. There was evidence, according to the Ryder report, evidence going back as far as the war in Afghanistan. Now we are going back even previous to 2003. We are talking about post-9/11 and the attack on the Taliban forces in Afghanistan.According to the Ryder report, as reported by Mr. Hersh, the MPs had worked with intelligence operatives to ``set favorable conditions for subsequent interviews,'' a euphemism, according to Mr. Hersh, for breaking the will of prisoners.Now, Mr. Hersh indicates that the Ryder report called for the establishment of procedures to ``define the role of military police soldiers, clearly separating the actions of the guards from those of the military intelligence personnel.''I am citing this detail to you, Mr. Speaker, because I think it is very important to establish a context here. General Ryder is the Provost Marshal of the Army. He is the chief law enforcement officer of the Army, and he in his report indicated serious questions with regard to the management and operation of the prison system, and indicated serious reservations about the kinds of expectations of the MPs with regard to military intelligence activity.Major General Taguba in his report, and, again, I am relying on the Hersh document because, to the best of my knowledge, these reports were not made available even to the intelligence committees, let alone to the Committee on Armed Services, either in the other body or in the House of Representatives.General Taguba was reported as saying, ``Unfortunately, many of the systemic problems that surfaced during Major General Ryder's assessment are the very same issues that are the subject of this investigation.''It amounts to an indictment, Mr. Speaker. I do not know any other way to put it. That is why I say I feel so badly coming down here today. Believe me, this brings no sense of satisfaction to me, to have to report this to you.If the Army was aware at the highest levels of the difficulties and challenges that existed, let alone the possibility of abuses or even undermining of good order within the Army in terms of what is expected of its personnel in the prison system, and was aware of that in the fall of 2003, it can hardly have come as a surprise then if General Taguba was exercised by what he found taking place in February of 2004.If indeed General Taguba's report is as detailed and as explicit and its recommendations as clear as it appears to be in the summary given to us in Mr. Hersh's article, how is it possible for the Secretary of Defense, who, after all, is in charge of the uniform military, and the Speaker is well aware of our constitutional circumstances here. The civilian authority is in charge with regard to what the policies of the United States military are going to be. How is it possible for the requisite authority in the Department of Defense not to be aware of what these issues were?It is very difficult for me to believe that General Sanchez kept this to himself, or that General Sanchez failed to act on the clear warning that General Ryder, his chief law enforcement officer, expressed to him in writing in November of last year. It is difficult for me to believe that there was not some awareness in the Department of Defense that there were possibilities here for disaster, political and military disaster.Mr. Speaker, it is fair, I suppose, for someone to ask, well, yes, of course we can see why you might be upset as a Member of Congress that you were not informed. And I am, I can assure you of that. In fact, I will cite to you, Mr. Speaker, in a few moments a letter received by the ranking member of the committee, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton), from the Secretary of Defense, that at best misleads, deliberately misleads the ranking member in questions that he had about private contractors, and at worst is a deliberate subterfuge and challenge to this Congress. Not to Democrats or Republicans. I am talking about a challenge to Congressional authority.I tell you, Mr. Speaker, we are walking on the edge of fascism in this country if the executive or executive departments think that they are able to make decisions absent the direction and will of the Congress of the United States. For good or for ill, Mr. Speaker, you and I are elected by the people of this country. Secretary Rumsfeld is not elected by anybody. He is an appointment and serves only because he has been approved by the Congress of the United States, in this instance the will of the other body as embodied in their charge in the Constitution.For good or for ill, the people of this country have put their faith and trust in us to make those decisions. We have clear jurisdictional lines in the Committee on Armed Services. We have clear admonition under the Constitution as to what our duty is and our obligation is under that Constitution with respect to funding and managing the United States military.For any executive, or anyone in the executive branch, to assume that he or she can take legislative authority unto themselves, particularly when it comes to oversight, is something that is anathema to the constitutional order. Executive authority, ruling by executive authority, has a fascist tinge to it that I find very, very troubling. I do not think it can be excused by the idea that we would be better off without knowing.I do not know if this is true, Mr. Speaker. I have only the media representations to me, seen in fleeting images and heard in passing tonight. But if I understood correctly and if the information is correct, the President of the United States found out about this from the media. The President of the United States was not informed that these issues were already underway and about to break in the public press.We are told, at least I am informed, again by media presentation, because we have not had any briefing or explanation of this in the Committee on Armed Services to my knowledge or to the Congress as a whole, that General Myers, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in fact asked a broadcast network, I believe the CBS network, not to publish or broadcast news of these events that it had before it and was prepared to bring forward.This is a startling development in our country, that this kind of censorship can take place, because we are not talking here about putting members of the United States military in harm's way because of the revelation of immediate plans of attack or the assumption of military planning that would otherwise bring aid and comfort or information to forces that might attack us or do us harm. This was not an instance of that.On the contrary, if what has been presented so far is true and is an accurate reflection of what took place, these are clear violations of regulations in the good order in the United States military and a severe blow to the activities of the United States with respect to the reconstruction of the physical facilities in Iraq and the establishment of civil government in the wake of the collapse of the Hussein regime.It strikes me that when the ranking member makes a request, as he did on April 2, and the ranking Member, as you know, is the senior minority member, in this instance the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton). He serves as the senior Democratic member on the Committee on Armed Services under the leadership of the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter).On April 2 Mr. Skelton wrote a letter to Mr. Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense. I would like to quote it to you in some length.``Dear Mr. Secretary. I would like to first extend my sympathy and display over the recent brutal killings in Fallujah. All of the killings in Iraq, both of our troops and of contractors and civilians, have been unacceptable and tragic, but the murder and desecration of the four Americans working for Blackwater USA was particularly barbaric. I would hope that plans are being prepared for a measured but powerful response. One of the issues raised by this tragedy is the role played by private military firms such as Blackwater.``Media reports indicate at the time of the ambush the personnel in question were providing security for a food delivery convoy. I understand that Blackwater provides personal security for Ambassador Paul Bremer. I would like to request that you provide my office with a breakdown of information regarding private military and security personnel in Iraq.''That bears repeating, Mr. Speaker: ``I would like to request you provide my office with a breakdown of information regarding private military and security personnel in Iraq. Specifically, I would like to know which firms are operating in Iraq, how many personnel each firm has there, what specific functions they are performing, how much they are being paid, and from which appropriations account. Additionally, I would like to understand what the chain of command is for these personnel, what rules of engagement govern them, and how disciplinary or criminal accusations are handled, if any such claims are levied against them.''This is in April, early April. These questions, these measured, sober, serious questions regarding the privatization of this war are being asked by the senior minority member of this House of the Committee on Armed Services.``Firms like Blackwater are clearly serving important functions in Iraq and putting themselves at risk. It is important that the Congress have a clear sense of the roles they are playing so that we can conduct effective oversight. I appreciate your assistance in this matter. Sincerely, Ike Skelton, Ranking Democrat.''I think by any measure, Mr. Speaker, this would be seen as a letter that, as I have already indicated, is sober and serious and measured in its content and specifically and particularly on the mark with respect to the role and responsibility of private contractors.Why am I bringing that up? Because it appears, Mr. Speaker, that there are serious instances of perhaps a blurring of institutional and responsibility lines, with private contracting, military intelligence, and the conduct of the prison guards and those in charge of the Army prisons.Why I am particularly exercised even more than I was this afternoon? Because I thought this afternoon, well, we have to try and determine where we are going to go, and I put out a release to that effect in order to answer to my constituents as to what the thoughts were on this issue at this time. I thought, well, we better be careful about making grand pronouncements about what we need to do and where we are going to go until we find out all of the facts and see where they lead. But I will tell my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, I have come to the conclusion that the Secretary of Defense has to think very seriously about resigning. I have come to that conclusion only since this afternoon, late this afternoon, early this evening, rather, when I became aware of the answer to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) dated May 4, the date that I received this, May 4 is printed on here; whether it was written May 4 or whether it was received in the office of the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) on May 4 is difficult for me to determine. It may be that that is a stamp to indicate to my office that it was received in my office on May 4.But here is the answer given by Donald Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense: ``Thank you for your letter of April 2 regarding private security personnel. A discussion paper provided by the Coalition Provisional Authority responding to the points that you raised is attached,'' and it is.Now, here is the answer given by the Secretary of Defense with regard to private companies, knowing, knowing now, this is April, knowing about the report of November 5, knowing about the 30-plus or 35 investigations under way, according to reports that we have received in the press, which I think reflect accurately some of the conversation that was held this afternoon. Multiple, let me put it this way, multiple investigations under way. Knowing that, knowing that he had the report of General Taguba before him, knowing that this material had been deliberately asked to be censored and withheld from publication in the network news.Here is what he says: ``Some private security companies called PSC, private security companies, under contract in Iraq provide, one, personal security services for senior civilian officials, as well as some visiting delegations. Two, they also provide physical security for nonmilitary facilities inside the green zone and convoy protection for nonmilitary goods. Three, they provide protection for government support teams consisting of Coalition Provisional Authority personnel and government contractors who team with local Iraqi officials to develop local government structures and functions.''Not a word, Mr. Speaker, about the role of private contractors and military intelligence or in the prison system. How is it possible for the Secretary of Defense not to mention this, given the context in which this answer was given to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton)? That is why I am so exercised about the contempt that the Secretary is showing for the Congress and yes, indeed, for the President of the United States. How is it possible for the Secretary of Defense to face Mr. Bush, let alone this Congress, and say that he deliberately, I cannot think of any way else to characterize it, deliberately kept us from understanding what it was that these private contractors were doing in this prison context.He goes on to say: ``It is my understanding that most of these private security companies doing business in Iraq do not work directly for the U.S. Government.'' Well, who are they working for then? They work under subcontracts to prime contractors to provide protection for their employees, as if there is some benign presence. We are in the middle of a war on terror, we are told. We are in the middle of a war in Iraq. The Speaker is well aware that I characterized this more than a year ago in May when we returned, when we were among the first group to go with the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), some of us went with him, among the first group to enter Baghdad after the initial attack on Baghdad and some of us said, yes, there was an attack on Baghdad and now the war is starting.Unfortunately, that has proven to be only too true, for the Secretary of Defense to pretend in the middle of a war situation in which our troops are put at risk, that somehow, there is this semi-benign presence in Iraq, of private contractors to go about their business without the supervision or the oversight of the Department of Defense and the United States military. I mean, it is an insult.``A draft CPA order, Coalition Provisional Authority order, on regulating the private security companies which will require certain data from each firm has been prepared with input from the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior.''I mean, the contempt of this letter is incredible.``The Iraqi Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Trade will be largely responsible for the administration of this and any revisions that may be promulgated by the Iraqi interim government after June 30. Finally, the Department of Defense is drafting uniform guidance regarding private security companies employed in Iraq under contract using U.S. appropriations.''It is as if it does not even exist at this point.``I hope this is useful. We can provide additional information or briefing if you would like.''Then we have a summary here in the attachment which includes a list, Mr. Speaker, of the private security companies operating in Iraq.Now, I believe that there was a company called CACI. I do not precisely have that because I do not have the report here; I am looking for it in this list of private security companies operating in Iraq. Perhaps it is listed here, but I cannot find it among the 60, the 60 companies that are listed here. It may be that I am not sufficiently conversant with the actual names and acronyms of the security companies that were working intelligence privately in Iraq. I would be more familiar with it had we been briefed on it, had we been given the information, as is not only our right, but our obligation to have in the Committee on Armed Services.I cannot find it. It is very, very difficult for me to believe that we are in a situation, post-Watergate in which it is necessary to know the answer ahead of time in order to ask the right question. It seems to me the questions posed by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) are clear enough. It seems to me that the answer here, while probably technically correct, leaves out valuable information. This is clearly not an exhaustive list of the private companies that were involved.I concentrate on this, Mr. Speaker, because I think we face a serious crisis here in the Congress. If we are going to allow the executive to conduct this war in our name, the name of the people of the United States, and we constitutionally have not only the authority, but the responsibilities of legislating the policies associated with arming and supporting our military, our United States military as well as establishing the policies of this Nation to be carried out by the executive. The executive does not tell us what to do. We again, for better or for ill, are given and required by the Constitution to exercise that legislative authority.The legislation we have put together, the policies that we have assume by virtue of a majority activity in both Houses of this Congress, are what constitutes the policies of this country that will be carried out by the executive. The executive can inform of his or her desires in this regard, but we are the ones that have to decide this. We are the ones that have to exercise the oversight.So I say to you, Mr. Speaker, that these are very, very serious allegations. No question about that. I do not come here this evening speaking with any kind of relish or enjoyment of what is required of us here. But I can tell you I was a probation officer in my life. I have been an officer of the court. I have had professional responsibilities in county jails, in San Quentin Prison. I know what it is like to have to conduct drug tests. I know what it is like to appear at a booking desk every morning year in and year out. I know what is involved in investigations in arrests and prosecutions.I know what is involved in making reports on what needs to be done and how it should be done and what the conducts of officers of the courts are with respect to the management and maintenance of jails and prison systems.I have legislative responsibilities with regard to how prison systems are run and under what circumstances and what is required of the personnel as a legislator. I have been the chairman of a committee with responsibility for the police departments in Honolulu, the Honolulu Police Department, under the jurisdiction of the committee that I was privileged to serve on and chair in the city and counties of Honolulu. I understand what is at stake in prison system, and I know this from my own personal experience, what is required in a prison system is, first of all, certainty, certainty.You must know from the top to the bottom exactly what the rules are. Certainty and activity. Those are the two fundamentals. Once you have those established in a prison system, then you know where you stand. Nobody can talk to me about failure to train some National Guard operatives on the jail cell level and tell me that they were operating on their own. That does not happen, Mr. Speaker. It does not happen in the county jail. It does not happen in a state prison. And it does not happen in a Federal prison system. Certainty from top to bottom is required. If it does not exist that is failure of leadership that has to be accounted for and responsibility has to be taken.So far as I can see right now, there is some reprimands being handed out. There are some court-martials being held at the lowest possible level. And yet we have two reports, the Ryder report and the Taguba report, that I do not believe for a moment did not see the light of day at the general officer level and at the highest levels of the Department of Defense.If it is true that the President of the United States was not informed by his Secretary of Defense as to what the situation was and what was likely to happen, that is dereliction of duty on the part of the Secretary vis-a-vis the President of the United States. It is far worse in my estimation that you let down the person who has entrusted you, entrusted you with the responsibility for carrying out the executive policies of this Nation.It is bad enough that the Congress of the United States was not informed. But they have the President of the United States left in the dark on something that was sure to have incredible negative ramifications with respect to Iraq and the position of the United States is unforgivable. It is intolerable. But I know as sure as my own experience indicates, that it is not possible for the leadership at the levels that I have discussed not to have been aware that at minimum the possibilities of this disaster was there and needed to be addressed. At a minimum. And worse, that they knew it was going on and tolerated it.We need to have a full exposure of exactly who knows what. Not because, Mr. Speaker, I wanted to have some kind of a media field day or some kind of a tabloid extravaganza, but because the very responsibility of this Congress is at stake. Either we are informed, Mr. Speaker, about what the situation is and where we are going so that we can make a decision with regard to oversight or we are not.So, Mr. Speaker, in conclusions, I want to ask you in your role as Speaker, to acknowledge the facts that this is a requirement of the Congress of the United States, that we exercise oversight on behalf of the people of this Nation and the values of this Nation. If we do not do it, Mr. Speaker, who is going to do it?It is apparent that no one wants to take responsibility in the Department of Defense. No one wants to take responsibility in the military at the present time. No one is exploring right now exactly what the boundaries were or were not. No one is examining the role of private security corporations in the intelligence gathering on behalf of the United States military and on behalf of the security interests of this Nation. No one asked me about it, I can assure you on the Committee on Armed Services as to whether I thought that was a good idea. I cannot speak about the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, but I am hard pressed to think that the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Republican or Democrat, this has nothing to do with the partisan nature of any kind of political discussion we might be having, but it is difficult for me to believe that anybody on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence sanctioned such a thing or that there was knowledge of it in the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence or that it would not have been shared with the Office of the Speaker at a minimum with the leadership of both sides of the aisle.We have to have an understanding of whether our role as overseers of the United States strategic interests is going to be honored. If we do, then perhaps we can reestablish some credibility. If we do not, then I fear that the role that Secretary Rumsfeld has assumed for himself, namely, chief operating officer of the United States, without any responsibility to the chief executive of this Nation, the President of the United States, or any responsibility to the Congress of the United States. He gets to decide what we will do and what we will not do. He gets to decide whether or not this country is going to be put into a series of circumstances and situations that are totally untenable in terms of the values of this Nation or what the goals and aspirations we have with regards to our security interests and the peace of the world.I think that we need to have a clear understanding that unless the Secretary can answer these questions he has to consider resigning. He has to consider whether or not we are going to have a cleansing of the way in which this war is being conducted, in the manner in which it was being reported to us in the Congress and by extension to the people of the United States.I appreciate the fact, Mr. Speaker, that these are difficult questions, that I have only been able to present a summary of what is at stake here; and I appreciate your patience and forebearance as I have enunciated it.I do think very, very clearly, Mr. Speaker, that there this is something that has to be addressed, and I would hope that the leadership of the House, both majority and minority, will settle on the proper venue, which I personally believe to be the Committee on Armed Services, but perhaps a joint committee situation, in which these issues are explored; and I hope that the Secretary of Defense will be able to answer adequately what his responsibility and obligation is.",

    "text": "If the gentleman will yield further, last evening I had an opportunity to speak in a special order, and I indicated then and I indicate again tonight in the wake of the gentleman's suggestion that the President was ill-served by those in authority who failed to inform him fully as to what all the conditions and circumstances were.There is no excuse for the leadership in the Department of Defense not informing the President of the United States as to what he might be facing with respect to the outcome that was here. I pointed out last night that this situation did not just develop with CBS on 60 Minutes II within the last 7 days. A report by the Provost Marshal of the United States Army, Major General Donald Ryder, in November of 2003, was in the hands of General Sanchez and in the hands of the Department of Defense and the Secretary in the fall of last year.In the wake of that, I have here and am displaying to my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, Article 15-6, investigation of the 800th Military Police Brigade. This was the report that was requested on January 19, 2004, subsequent to the Provost Marshal's investigation and report, which indicated severe difficulties, tensions between military intelligence-gathering and proper prison conduct by those in charge of the prisons, indicating that there were training problems, operational problems that needed to be addressed. And so on January 19, Lieutenant General Sanchez, Lieutenant General Sanchez, the commander of the Combined Joint Task Force 7, requested that the U.S. Central Command appoint an investigating officer, and that investigating officer, of course, was General Taguba. His report responded to the admonitions of Lieutenant General Sanchez that an investigation of detention and internment operations be undertaken, starting from November of 2003. November of 2003 is when the report went in, indicating that there had to be steps taken to address these questions.Let me quote from the opening paragraph. ``Lieutenant General Sanchez cited recent reports of detainee abuse, escapes from confinement facilities, and accountability lapses, which indicated systemic problems within the brigade and suggested a lack of clear standards, proficiency, and leadership.''Fifty-three pages later, and if the gentleman will grant now, I will not cite over and over again what is taking place in here, but one shocking event after another.This 53-page report, and this comes from CQ Today, Congressional Quarterly Today by Neil Soros from the CQ staff, and he quotes, ``The 53-page report drafted by Army General Antonio Taguba, and based on an investigation into the abuse allegations,'' that is this report that I hold in my hand, ``that began in January was finished in April. The report was detailed in this week's New Yorker magazine. At a Pentagon news conference today, Secretary Rumsfeld defended the time it takes to release such information.''Now, this information was available from November of last year.Quote: ``I recognize the appetite of people for instant information and instant conclusions,'' he said. That is to say Secretary Rumsfeld. ``These things are complicated. They take some time. It required interviewing people back in the States who had already left Iraq that required discussions with people. They are proceeding in a very systematic and appropriate way, and to the extent I conclude at any time there is some slice of it that has not been investigated, has not been looked at properly, you can be sure I will undertake such an investigation.''Clearly, the Secretary of Defense is dissembling and somehow thinks that everybody in this country can be fooled as to what his responsibility is. The Secretary of Defense has known, at least since November of last year, what was going on and did not even inform the President of the United States, because the Secretary of Defense, as I said last night, apparently has assumed that he is the chief operating officer of this country and that he does not need to inform the Congress, he does not only not need to inform the Congress, but does not even need to inform the President of the United States.I yield to the gentleman from Ohio.",

    "title": "ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to speak here this evening on Asian Pacific American Heritage Month Special Order. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues on the congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus to recognize Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. As a member of the caucus's executive committee, I want to honor the many achievements and contributions of more than 11 million Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent in our country.As has been mentioned by the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case), back in 1978 my friends and colleagues, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, former Senator Spark Matsunaga, former Representative Frank Horton, and former Representative Norm Mineta, helped establish the first 10 days of May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Week. Fast forward to the 102nd Congress: legislation establishing the entire month of May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month was signed into law.The congressional district I represent is composed of approximately 70 percent Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. There is a special strength and resilience embodied in Hawaii's unique cultural mix. We have chosen to be defined by our diversity rather than divided by our differences. That resolve to work together with Aloha can serve as an example for the rest of the country and I might say, Mr. Speaker, for the world.For those of us from the State of Hawaii, there is something missing in this year's heritage month celebration, however: the dynamic presence of our colleague Patsy Takemoto Mink. Patsy fought all her life for social and economic justice. Throughout nearly 50 years of public service, she championed America's most deeply held values: equality, fairness, and, above all, honesty. Her courage, her willingness to speak out and champion causes that others might shun resulted in tremendous contributions in the fields of civil rights and education. She has earned an honored place in the history of the United States House of Representatives as the co-author of title IX, which guarantees equality for women in education programs. Every single woman in this Nation who today has access to equal opportunity in education and by extension in virtually every other field of endeavor owes a debt to Patsy Mink.She was one of the pioneers who transformed Hawaii and transformed the Nation. Whenever any of us felt some sense of discouragement, whenever any of us felt some sense of despair or feeling we could not succeed, it was only required for Patsy to come into the room to change the atmosphere. Patsy Mink had the capacity to make dead air move. Patsy Mink, this little dynamo from Hawaii, was a giant in her heart and in her commitment. I miss her every day. I measure all I do by her unfailing standard of integrity.She would be the first to say while we can look at Asian Pacific American Heritage Month as a time to recognize and celebrate many individual accomplishments, we must also take action. The other members of Hawaii's congressional delegation and I are working every day to respond to the issues raised by people of Hawaii and the Nation. I hope I can work productively to resolve them, always remembering that our Nation should be defined by our diversity rather than be divided by our differences. I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Honda).",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that these discussions that we have held and are holding weekly on the floor here are meant to communicate with our colleagues and with the American people. This is our forum to do it. I think those who may be observing our proceedings here today need to take up, if they believe what we have said tonight, the cause of having Mr. Bush remove his support from Mr. Chalabi.I think people across the country have to ask their representatives, as well as communicate with the White House. They have to ask their Representatives and Senators, do you support this Chalabi administration and the Iraqi Governing Council? Do you support Mr. Chalabi being a part of this sovereignty movement after June 30? If you do, there have to be serious questions about your competence to be holding office and acting on our behalf.This is a question that needs to be asked. Americans need not feel impotent, they need not feel they are merely observers of what other people are doing to you and doing to this country. You can demand of your elected Representatives and Senators, where do you stand on this Chalabi issue?It is not a matter of getting an individual, I am sure we all agree. He is representative of a failure of leadership. His position in the Iraqi Governing Council is an insult to those people who have been wounded and who have been killed during this war. It is an insult to those of us who uphold genuine ideas about freedom and democracy and their spread. So long as this man is there, being the official representative of the United States to the Iraqi Governing Council, to that same degree will we be disenabled from achieving any of these goals, regardless of how one feels about going to war in Iraq or not.This is what needs to be done. You have to demand of your representatives, where do you stand on this issue of his continued presence as being officially supported by the United States of America?",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield, I think what is important here then to get across this evening is that calling people to account is what we do. The oversight function of the Congress has a long history. I can go back to the time in which some people wonder how Harry Truman got to be chosen as Vice President of the United States just prior to Franklin Roosevelt's death, before his last campaign. Of course, he had made his reputation on an oversight committee in the Senate looking into war profiteering, is what he had done, trying to hold people to account. That is what this is all about.If someone wants to take up the position that this is a concentration on President Bush for partisan activity, he is the President. He is making the decisions, and those decisions are subject to scrutiny.As the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton) very well knows, back at the time when Mr. Clinton made decisions about Bosnia and Kosovo, I found myself in opposition to him and said so. I think at least as far as this Member is concerned, I do not have to take a back seat to anybody in trying to bring anybody to account in the executive, Democrat or Republican, if I think that is in order.If I know my friend, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton), well, and I think I do, he does not stand for anybody telling him who should be brought to account either. He has stood up on more than one occasion, perhaps even singularly, calling for an accounting on various issues. I think that is his function and our function, and that is what this Iraq Watch is all about, I can guarantee you that. If we think somebody is doing the right thing, we are going to say so; if we think somebody is not acting necessarily in the best interests of the United States, regardless of what their motivation might be, it is up to us to say so and engage in a dialogue to try to illuminate where the interests of the American people are.I know that the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton) agrees with that, and I look forward to any discussion we might have in the future along those lines.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is not interference at all, believe me, because this is complementary to what has been said. I can tell the gentleman on April 20 of this year, he is thinking about an army. Here is what he said to the Committee on Armed Services, Mr. Wolfowitz said, on April 20: ``There is no question it would be nice right now to have a larger army.'' These are the same people that were claiming, and reclaimed again today, that General Shinseki was wrong. He did not mention General Shinseki, but he went out of his way to make sure that everybody understood that we did not need a greater Armed Forces even though he said so; it would be nice to have a larger Army but absent that, after all, we can on the 200,000 security forces that he says are now in place.I have his testimony here before me, a written statement given today before the Committee on Armed Services in which he indicates on Page 3 that we are going to be full partners with the Iraqis. This has to do with the sovereignty issue, that they are going to take the lead, he says elsewhere, that they have 200,000 Iraqis in a security force that is a ``work in progress,'' an interesting way of looking at it, that according to the Prime Minister, as related by Mr. Wolfowitz, they are ready to take charge on July 1. There has been enormous progress.So I asked him today, well, is there an end in sight? And there is no end in sight. It is schizophrenic. I pointed that out to him today. On the one hand, everything is fine, everything is working according to plan, maybe a little bit behind schedule, but nonetheless working its way right along; and on the other hand, we are going to have to be there forever as some kind of partner. I asked partners, I understand the word ``partner'' and the phrase ``full partner.'' What does it mean in terms of who is in charge in relation to these young and men as well as some older members of the Guard and Reserves who are being killed and wounded? Who is in charge? I cannot get from General Pace, I cannot get from Secretary Wolfowitz, who is in charge. Who makes the decisions? They are talking about a partnership on all levels, regional, national, and local; a unity of command; a consensus on the way ahead. And it is supposed to be working out of what are called joint operating centers. How these joint operating centers are supposed to make any decisions regionally or locally or nationally is beyond me.What is clear from the testimony today is all the discussion that has been taking place about the reasons for going to this war have been entirely set aside; and now apparently what the mission of the United States is, is to act as some kind of backup force, according to them: ``U.S. forces are there to help out. They are backup.'' That is the motto, a backup force for whatever is to take place now to achieve some kind of nation-building. That is now what our mission is all about. It has nothing to do with weapons of mass destruction. It has nothing to do with anything else that was used as a reference point for why we are going to war, an immediate threat to the United States in terms of weapons of mass destruction, some kind of military connection to terrorist organizations that are an immediate threat to the United States.",

If there was not anything before, we have now created it as a result of the actions that we took based on this false information.So now the situation has been redefined. The war on terror has been redefined to be the activities of what are termed killers and terrorists and all kinds of anecdotal references as to what that means. We have to go no further than what happened today, an assassination in Mosul of the head of a law school and her husband being beheaded, killed with her and beheaded; another American soldier dying; roadside bombings, all the rest of these kinds of activities taking place so that what was going to happen, in my judgment, on July 1 is that the American military will be set adrift in a desert sea with no compass, with no direction, with nothing except to provide backup under this full partnership in these so-called joint operating centers to make decisions about what we are going to do with the military in Iraq. I was unable to determine today from Mr. Wolfowitz exactly what the role of the Guard and Reserve forces and what the deployment schedule are going to be.I asked, is there an end in sight? I got Korea, 50 years. I got Germany as an answer. I got Bosnia as an answer. I said, if that is the case, if you are going to cite Bosnia, which he does over and over again, in Bosnia there has been a steady drawdown of troops. Times and schedules are announced. Troops have been drawn down. If we are talking about Korea or Germany, none of the conditions prevail in South Korea or Germany that prevail in Iraq today. So, the analogies are at best totally inaccurate and have nothing to do with what is taking place today in Iraq.The question remains, if the reasons for going to war have now proven to be at best inadequate, and, at worst, false and misleading, and deliberately so in order to fulfill whatever ideological agenda was then in place in the Bush administration, the fact is now that the mission of the United States military is to somehow provide a backdrop, a foundation or background to this increasingly apparent civil war that is now underway in Iraq.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, as you know, and our friends know, we have been engaged in a conversation for some months now with regard to what we have come to term the Iraq Watch; and I was very pleased to note that my good friend and esteemed colleague, the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), indicated in the last hour that he and other Members were occupying, that they would be pleased at some point, perhaps in the future, to work out an opportunity for a dialogue, not necessarily a debate, but a conversation among friends with respect to Iraq and its implications for the United States, perhaps even combining hours. I do not know what the rules are precisely on that, and I do not ask for a ruling on that right now, Mr. Speaker; but at some point we hope to be able to do that, hopefully for the benefit of the membership and for those members of the American public and others that may be tuning in to our Special Orders.For this evening's opportunity, however, I wanted to begin our discussion tonight with some references and observations over the so-called handover of sovereignty. I think, Mr. Speaker, you might agree that with respect to Iraq, and unfortunately not only Iraq, there tends to be opportunities for the media in particular to seize on certain phrases. They become almost phrases of art. These phrases then substitute for a whole panoply of analysis that might otherwise usefully take place.In this instance, the phrase that I am referring to is the so-called ``handover of sovereignty.'' Handover of sovereignty, what that means is not clear to me at this stage.What I did observe during our break was a ceremony which took place under very, very strained circumstances. The television news was suddenly filled with the ominous music, the drumbeats, the portentous rhythms that seem to indicate that something of spectacular import is about to happen. Breaking news. Stentorian voices, a sound, and then suddenly we are told, well, we are going to go to the handover of sovereignty in Iraq. It is to take place in secret. It is to take place with a pool reporter there, apparently a pool camera. It is in some secret room somewhere in the green zone, presumably, I guess, in one of the palaces, or what are referred to as palaces, in Baghdad; and, suddenly, there is Ambassador Bremer and some folks there with handshakes and pieces of paper passed back and forth. No real idea of what it is all about other than smiles and handshakes all around.And suddenly sovereignty ostensibly has been transferred or handed over. That it took place in secret, that it took place ostensibly to prevent terrorist activity from disrupting it probably speaks more about what the handover was actually all about and whether or not the word ``sovereignty'' might properly apply.In both instances, I think not. There was no handover of sovereignty. How can there be sovereignty when you do not control your armed forces, when the first pronouncements of your ostensibly sovereign government involve the possibility of imposing martial law on your own people and indications that the governing authority, that is to say the Coalition Provisional Authority under Mr. Bremer, still absent him in person, is going to be in charge of the military activities, presumably, according to this handover of sovereignty ceremony, under some kind of group discussion terminology.Again, I fail to understand exactly how this ``partnership,'' which was referred to between the so-called sovereign Government of Iraq and the Government of the United States through its military, is supposed to take place.It is unclear to me that the questions that I asked of Assistant Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz in our Committee on Armed Services hearings, unclear to me whether these questions were answered. I simply said, ``Who is in charge? Who has the authority?'' And what I got was the usual dissembling and allusions to the idea of group discussions taking place. I am not quite sure how one responds to military situations in the arena of group discussions, but I suppose it is possible.My own thought at that time was, and I said at that time and repeat again tonight, that my perception was that at the turnover of sovereignty, at least as best I was able to understand that term, the American military would be set adrift on a desert sea and would find itself in a situation of being the first responders in an Iraqi crisis and that we would be uncertain as to who exactly was issuing the orders and under what circumstances they would be obeyed.This constitutes, for me, a crisis of another character, a crisis for us to answer; and in that context it is clear to me that the handover of sovereignty amounts to little more than a propaganda device meant to try to distance the political consequences and implications of our occupation from the political realities as the election approaches.Obviously, people will have to make their own minds up on that score; but in relation to that then, among the first pronouncements of this sovereign government was that under consideration was a possible policy of amnesty and that the amnesty would extend to those people who had murdered American troops, those people who had been involved in the insurgency that has taken place since the hostilities or major hostilities were pronounced at an end, i.e., mission accomplished by Mr. Bush some time ago on the infamous aircraft carrier stunt.And subsequent to that, obviously this insurgency, again, this is a term that has been adopted by the media uncritically, has resulted in numerous deaths and woundings. Most members of, certainly, the Committee on Armed Services and other Members of the House of Representatives and members of the subcommittees of the other body have traveled both in their districts and here in Washington and in Germany to hospital situations where we have been able to speak with and, hopefully, bring some measure of comfort and support to members of the military who have been wounded, members of the military and others, including civilian employees. But all that has taken place since this pronouncement that the war was essentially over, that the major activities surrounding the invasion was over; and now we find that this sovereign government is contemplating offering amnesty to those people.Now, if that is in fact what this has come to, I think the implications and consequences are serious indeed. There is no question in my mind that there will be some very serious dialogue taking place in this Nation if that is what this was all about, the opportunity for a government that has come into being solely as a result of the activities of the United States of America subsequent to the invasion, including and subsequent to the invasion of Iraq; and now we find a general amnesty being contemplated.That was never discussed, to my knowledge, with any members of the Committee on Armed Services. It was never discussed, to my knowledge, with members of the subcommittees of Congress generally as to whether or not that was something that we could abide. One would think that at a minimum this sovereign government in Iraq would have the courtesy, if only out of respect for those who have died and those who have been wounded on their behalf, to at least engage in some form of a dialogue with the United States in regard to that possible amnesty.I see my friend from Washington is about to ask for the floor, and I would be happy to yield to him.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, because just before I came back, let me give my colleagues something so that it is not abstract. I will tell my colleagues exactly what I had to deal with and what came up while we were away on our holiday.My staff representing my delegation was briefed by Major General Lee, the adjutant general of the State of Hawaii, on the situation of the 29th Brigade, Hawaii Army National Guard. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army approved the alert of the 29th Brigade for deployment to Iraq. Earlier indications were, of course, that the 29th would be deployed to Afghanistan; but the situation on the ground in Iraq now requires additional soldiers from the 120,000 now there, and the enhanced 29th Brigade is needed.Now, this is happening all across the country; and if anybody thinks for a second that the 5,000 or 6,000 that are going to be involved in this current recall-up, involuntary call-up is going to solve it, I think they are dreaming.The 29th is one of the two remaining National Guard brigades not yet activated. It will perform reinforcing missions.Remember when I indicated here before that when this so-called sovereignty occurred, the United States military would be set adrift on a desert sea.They will perform reinforcing missions, whatever in God's name that means. The expected deployment will be 12 months. The brigade will have to travel off-island to train up, because the normal training entity, the 25th division, of course, is now deployed itself. The brigade may go to Fort Bliss, et cetera; expect the deployment to Iraq to take place shortly.Then what do we have to do? The adjutant general then had to brief all of the mayors that once the alert notice was released in Washington, we had to then discuss what the impact would be on homeland defense and natural disaster impacts back in Hawaii, because the Guard normally is going to address those situations. The National Guard is, of course, the primary backup to civilian authority. Now we are going to have to rely on the Air National Guard since most of the Army National Guard is going to be deployed. Now, this is just in Hawaii.Now, we can imagine what is taking place elsewhere all around the country? Part of our problem area in Hawaii is that the police and fire departments are going to be adversely affected because a major portion of the Army guard are police officers and firefighters and teachers. So there will be about 2,500 soldiers from Hawaii and about 3,500 coming from American Samoa, Guam, and California. Now, that is just one instance; and that is the reality.I want to conclude by saying the impacts on this are considerable, because the employers, whether they are public employers or private employers, have to take into account the absence of these folks at this particular time. What is happening right now is we are denying what the realities of the necessities for troops are in Iraq and Afghanistan and are masking it over with Guard and Reserve deployments; and we are going to have to pay a fearful price for that.I yield to the gentleman from Washington.",

The company, which employs 30,000 workers from 38 countries in support of the U.S. military, said it had been unaware of the workers' concerns until recently.''This is the kind of thing, Kellogg Brown, Halliburton, is always unaware of, workers problems, because they are too busy having their accountants going to work on the excessive profits they are making.It brings to mind the work that was done by one Senator Harry Truman when, during World War II, he had his committee on a bipartisan basis looking into the question of excessive profit-making from World War II. This is not something that is invented for this time and place by members of the Democratic Party. This is something that was headed up by a Democratic Senator, who was in charge in the United States Senate, on a bipartisan basis, to see to it that profiteering does not take place at the expense of the American soldiers or the expense of the American taxpayer.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3479, the Brown Tree Snake Control and Eradication Act of 2004. This measure will not only ensure continued security for Hawaii and Guam, but the entire Pacific region.The Hawai'i Biological Survey has documented that an average of 177 alien species arrive in the State of Hawai'i each year. Out of all the possible alien plants and animals that could make their way to the Hawaiian Islands, one of the most feared is the brown tree snake.The brown tree snake arrived in Guam on military materiel transport from the Solomon Islands after World War II. Because Guam has no natural predator for the brown tree snake, the snakes have been able to flourish and have been recorded as high as 10,000 snakes per acre. The brown tree snake is blamed for the extinction of 9 out of 11 bird species native to Guam. These snakes also cause frequent and costly power outages and are known to bite humans. Like Guam, Hawaii has no native snakes and no natural predators for snakes. Only one pregnant brown tree snake needs to reach Hawaii in order for the State to experience the same catastrophic consequences as Guam.Wildlife Services under the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in the Department of Agriculture provides brown tree snake control on Guam by inspecting outgoing military and civilian cargo and providing trapping services at Guam's ports. These services interdict 6,000 to 7,000 snakes annually and have proved to be very successful in keeping the brown tree snake out of Hawaii.For the past 10 years, the funding for these services has remained fixed. The program was able to make up for inflation and increasing costs by stopgap measures that have enabled them to continue services. However, this is no longer possible. Unforeseen vehicle repair or replacement costs, critical travel associated with program delivery, required training for staff, increased costs of operations and growing containment responsibilities are forcing significant reductions in operations. Compounding the problem, Wildlife Services has been informed by Anderson Air Force Base that it will have to begin to pay for in-kind services that have been provided to the program at no cost since 1994. To compensate for this additional unanticipated financial burden, further reductions in staffing are anticipated in early fiscal year 2005.H.R. 3479 would begin to resolve these problems by recognizing the seriousness of the threat posed by the brown tree snake. This legislation authorizes the Departments of Agriculture and Interior to fund brown tree snake interdiction and control efforts and provide grants for these efforts. Just as important, this measure would support research efforts to control and eventually eradicate this harmful species from Guam. Current funding does not allow for in depth research that could lead to less labor intensive solutions than the current bait and trap method. This legislation also requires the establishment of pre-departure quarantine protocols for persons and cargo traveling from Guam. This will ensure that this species is not able to spread to other Pacific destinations.Madam Speaker, this legislation is being considered at a crucial point in time. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and thank Chairman Pombo and Ranking Member Rahall for their continued efforts to address the problems of the distant Pacific. I would also like to thank Congresswoman Bordallo and her staff. Without the effort of all of these parties, this legislation would not be before the House today.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 163, a bill to re-instate the draft. I oppose the draft and do not want to see it brought back.I added my name to this bill in order to promote an open, honest public discussion of the personnel crisis facing our military today, and in that sense I welcome today's vote. It is unfortunate, however, that H.R. 163 is being brought to the floor with only a few hours notice, depriving the American public of the extended exploration this problem deserves.It is not a coincidence that today's vote is taking place as public uneasiness is rising with regard to the draft. It is obvious to everyone that the demands of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are narrowing the Administration's options. Our regular divisions and brigades are stretched to the limit. The Reserve and National Guard are being drawn upon to the point where they now comprise nearly half of all U.S. troops in Iraq. Stop loss is the order of the day, holding servicemen and women in uniform past their discharge dates. We're even dipping into the Individual Ready Reserve, calling up people who have completed not only their active duty obligations, but their active reserve obligations as well. Under these circumstances, the growing suspicions of the Administration's intentions in regard to a draft are well-founded.In fact, I have found confirmation of those suspicions. KITV television news of Honolulu reported last night on a February 11, 2003, Selective Service System document which was provided to me recently and which I have shared with several of my colleagues. Judging from its contents, it appears to be a memo prepared for a meeting between the Acting Director of the Selective Service, the Principal Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, and other senior Defense and Selective Service officials. The document takes note of critical shortages of military personnel with certain skills and raises the idea of drafting them to alleviate the shortages.Features of this ``bring back the draft'' memo include:--Draft registration for women as well as men;--Registration of all citizens and resident aliens between the ages of 18 and 34;--Require registrants to submit periodic updates of their skills and education up to the age of 35;--Draftees would be sent not only into the military, but also to the Department of Homeland Security, state, and municipal government agencies; and--Suggests the House and Senate Armed Services Committees be asked to pass legislation to bring back this expanded draft.The public deserves the chance to fully consider and discuss these radical ideas and participate meaningfully in any decision to adopt such drastic steps to address the very real personnel needs of our military forces stemming from the demands of multiple deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, and beyond. Bringing H.R. 163 to the floor for a vote without hearings, without warning, deprives the Nation and the Congress of an opportunity for that full consideration and discussion.Right now we have a back door draft, euphemistically called stop loss orders, that keeps troops in uniform even after their enlistments are over. At the same time, we are putting our National Guard and Reserve under intolerable strain, keeping them on active duty far longer than they or their families could have anticipated.One of the most frustrating aspects of these problems is that they were foreseeable. General Eric Shinseki, then Army Chief of Staff, accurately predicted we would need far more troops than the Administration was willing to commit to occupy Iraq. He was publicly condemned by the Administration for telling the truth. I voted against the Iraq war because, among other reasons, it was clear the Administration was unwilling to send enough troops to pacify that country after the initial military attack. Paul Bremer, the former chief of the Coalition Provisional Authority, just confirmed that fact in a speech yesterday.If we are to meet this troop strength crisis, a serious and open discussion needs to take place involving the public, elected leaders, and senior national security officials. The Administration wants to operate in secret in order to hide that discussion from the public. Bringing H.R. 163 to the floor for a vote is a partial victory for public discussion, a reflection of the public's insistent concern over the issue. On the other hand, the furtive way in which it was brought to the floor is a partial victory for those who want to keep the issue in the shadows.We have been dealing with this matter for years in the Armed Services Committee. During the 14 years that I have served on the Committee, the questions have never been as urgent as they are now:--What happens if a quick victory in Iraq is elusive, and we remain there for years to come?--What troop strength levels and mix of active, National Guard, and Reserves will be needed in the coming years?--Can the all-volunteer military keep its ranks filled?--If not, what options does the nation have?--How can we get better pay, benefits, and quality of life improvements to attract and retain enough troops and their families?As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I work on a daily basis with my colleagues and military leaders in the search for answers. It is a long and often difficult process. Its worth is measured in improvements in the lives of our fighting men and women, their families, and our veterans.I was proud to vote for badly needed equipment like Humvee armor protection and stronger body armor for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. I have championed better military family housing for troops based in my home state of Hawaii and around the globe. I was one of the authors of the Tricare for Life bill, which provides military retirees with the health coverage they were promised when they enlisted.What solutions are offered by those who want to pretend we don't face a military personnel crisis? Do they support the Administration's covert moves--despite public denials--to restart the draft? What do they have to say about the stop loss orders that deny thousands of troops and their families the post-service opportunities they were led to expect? How do they propose to deal with our over-reliance on the National Guard and Reserves, which are already strained to the limit? Most importantly, will they discuss these issues fully and openly, or do they want them decided in secret?",

    "title": "TOPICAL AGENDA",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, great interest has been generated by the publication of a document from the 11th of February 2003 entitled ``Topical Agenda''. It involves the Department of Defense Personnel and Readiness Undersecretary and the Selective Service System and its Acting Director.This document appears on the web site of ``Rock the Vote''. The interest is intense because of the content of the agenda. It involves a review of selective service major policy issues since 1973; a synopsis of Department of Defense Policy regarding the draft and a detailed proposal for the renewal of the draft and conditions attendant to it.The participation of the Department of Defense in the discussion associated with the agenda has been confirmed by the Secretary of Defense. The DOD contention is that the meeting on the agenda was for purposes of discussion only and that it took place off Pentagon premises. Obviously, the location of the discussion and the origination of the agenda for discussion purposes is immaterial to the issue at hand. The point is the Department of Defense from the Secretary on down has vigorously denied that any such discussions have ever taken place let alone been contemplated. This document shows that a detailed proposal for a new draft involving men and for the first time women has been under consideration and discussion by the Department of Defense. It also clearly indicates that consideration has been given to drafting not only for military needs but for purposes associated with the Department of Homeland Security. In addition it proposes that the draft age be extended from 18 to 34. It includes a proposition that a ``self-declaration'' of skill sets be required of all potential draftees to be periodically updated until the age of 35.It is not enough for the Department of Defense to say it rejects the proposal and its findings. Saying ``no'' doesn't make it so. Denials that any such consideration has even been given let alone presently extent ring hollow in the wake of the implications of this agenda and the Department of Defense's participation in discussing it.Given the broad and deep concern of the public about the draft and the possibility of its being reinstituted it is imperative that the public be enabled to see, understand and analyze what the Department of Defense has had under consideration. The public, of course, can draw its own conclusions. The ``Agenda'' report follows.DoD Participants: Hon. Charles S. Abell, Principal Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness; Mr. William Carr, Acting Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Military Personnel Policy; Colonel David Kopanski, Deputy Director, Accession Policy. SSS Participants: Mr. Lewis C. Brodsky. Acting Director of Selective Service; Mr. Richard S. Ftahavan, Director of Public &amp; Congressional Affairs.1. A hedge against underestimating the number of soldiers, needed to fight a future war; 2. A symbol of national resolve to potential adversaries; and, 3. A link between the all-volunteer Armed Forces and society-at-large. Clinton also instructs SSS to increase operational efficiency. Instructs DoD to update MOB requirements for SSS, re-examine timelines, and review arguments for and against continuing to exclude women from registration. F. 1994--Defense issues new ``post-Cold War'' guidance to SSS: ``provide first untrained draftee to MEPS at M+193; first Health Care draftee at M+222,'' DoD reaffirms that it is not necessary to register or draft women (for a conventional draft of untrained manpower) because they are prohibited by policy from serving in ground combat assignments. SSS recognizes women may have to be included in a health care draft. G. 1998--DoD Health Affairs says health care personnel would be needed earlier than M+222 in a future conflict. Guidance changed to M+90. Today, HCPDS can be implemented, but ability to meet M+90 time frame is doubtful. Program not fully tested and compliance aspects still not complete. H. 1995 through 2000--Anti-SSS Members of Congress almost successful in eliminating SSS through the appropriations process. SSS undergoes structure and program reductions to make ends meet. Readiness suffers. I. 2000 and 2001--DoD and SSS plan and implement joint mailing project to increase peacetime relevancy of SSS and improve timeliness and address accuracy of DoD recruiting direct mail campaigns. J. 2002 and 2003--Administration says use of draft not an option for war on terrorism or potential war with Iraq. Rep. Rangel and Sen. Hollings introduce bills (H.R. 163 and S. 69) call for reinstituting a draft for military and national Synopsis: With known shortages of military personnel with certain critical skills, and with the need for the nation to be capable of responding to domestic emergencies as a part of Homeland Security planning, changes should be made in the Selective Service System's registration program and primary mission. Situation: Currently, and in accordance with the Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) [50 U.S.C., App. 451 et seq.), the Selective Service System (SSS) collects and maintains personal information from all U.S. male citizens and resident aliens. Under this process, each man is required to ``present himself for and submit to registration'' upon reaching age 18. The methods by which a man can register with Selective Service include the Internet, mail-back postcard, checking a box on other government forms, and through the driver's license applications process in many states. The collected data is retained in an active computer file until the man reaches age 26 and is no longer draft eligible. It consists of the man's name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth. Currently, 91 percent of all men, ages 18 through 25, are registered, enabling the SSS to conduct a timely, fair, and equitable draft in the event the Congress and the President decide to reinstate conscription during a crisis. However, the Secretary of Defense and Department of Defense manpower officials have stated recently that a draft will not be necessary for any foreseeable crisis. They assume that sufficient fighting capability exists in today's ``all- volunteer'' active and reserve Armed Forces for likely contingencies, making a conventional draft of untrained manpower somewhat obsolete. Yet, Defense manpower officials concede there are critical shortages of military personnel with certain skills, such as medical personnel, linguists, computer network engineers, etc. The costs of attracting and retaining such personnel for military service could be prohibitive, leading some officials to conclude that while a conventional draft may never be needed, a draft of men and women possessing these critical skills may be warranted in a future crisis, if too few volunteer. Proposal: In line with today's needs, the SSS' structure, programs and activities should be re-engineered toward maintaining a national inventory of American men and (for the first time) women, ages 18 through 34, with an added focus on identifying individuals with critical skills. An interagency task force should examine the feasibility of this proposal which would require amendments to the MSSA, expansion of the current registration program, and inclusion of women. In addition to the basic identifying information collected in the current program, the expanded and revised program would require all registrants to indicate whether they have been trained in, possess, and professionally practice, one or more skills critical to national security or community health and safety. This could take the form of an initial ``self- declaration'' as a part of the registration process. Men and women would enter on the SSS registration form a multi-digit number representing their specific critical skill (e.g., similar to military occupationa1 specialty or Armed Forces Specialty Code with Skill Identifier), taken from a lengthy list of skills to be compiled and published by the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. Individuals proficient in more than one critical skill would list the practiced skill in which they have the greatest degree of experience and competency. They would also be required to update reported information as necessary until they reach age 35. This unique data base would provide the military (and national, state, and municipal government agencies) with immediately available links to vital human resources . . . in effect, a single, most accurate and complete, national inventory of young Americans with special skills. While the data base's ``worst-case'' use might be to draft such personnel into military or homeland security assignments during a national mobilization, its very practical peacetime use could be to support recruiting and direct marketing campaigns aimed at encouraging skilled personnel to volunteer for community or military service opportunities, and to consider applying for hard-to-fill public sector jobs. Local government agencies could also tap this data base to locate nearby specialists for help with domestic crises and emergency situations. With the changes described above, SSS programs would be modified to serve the contemporary needs of several customers: Department of Defense; Department of Homeland Security (FEMA. U.S. Border Patrol, U.S. Customs, INS). Corporation for National Service, Public Health Service, and other federal and state agencies seeking personnel with critical skills for national security or community service assignments. The SSS would thus play a more vital, relevant, and immediate role in shoring up America's strength and readiness in peace and war.2. Return the SSS to ``Deep Standby'' status. If a draft of any kind is highly unlikely and undesirable, eliminate peacetime registration and dismiss the 10,000 trained volunteer Board Members. However, should a draft be needed, it would take more than a year to get the system capable of conducting a fair and equitable draft from Deep Standby status. 3. Restructure the SSS and shift its peacetime focus to accommodate DoD's most likely requirements in a crisis. Plan for conducting a more likely draft of individuals with special and critical skills. a. Minimum requirement: SSS mission guidance and time lines must be redefined promptly by DoD to allow more relevant pre- mobilization planning and funding for the possibility of a critical skills draft at M+90 of sooner. Peacetime registration of men 18 through 25 would continue, but consideration would also be given to identifying men with certain critical skills among these year-of-birth groupings. A post-mobilization plan would also be devised and computer programming accomplished for a full-blown critical skills draft. The HCPDS program is completed, brought to the forefront of SSS readiness planning, and tested through exercises. Without a reaffirmation of relevance and adjustment of mission, the SSS will be an easy target for reduction or elimination by detractors in the Congress and the Administration. b. Expanded pre-mobilization requirement: SSS peacetime registration expanded to include women and men, 18 through 34 years old, and collects information on critical skills within these year-of-birth groupings. Requires change of law and additional funding (see Issue Paper dated 11 Feb 2003). B. If more examination of the issue and options is needed, consider forming an interagency task force to provide the Administration with a policy recommendation. Possible players: DoD, SSS, DHS, NSC, OMB, Corporation for National Service, PHS, others. C. After suitable analysis, obtain a White House Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) announcing plans for the future of the SSS (course of action l, 2, or 3, above). D. If the SSS is to expand its pre-mobilization activities to include registration of women and collection of critical skills identifiers, it will be necessary to market the concept for approval by the Armed Services Committees and Appropriations Committee draft implementing legislation for congressional consideration. The changes will be implemented after the amended law is signed and funding is identified.",

    "title": "IRAQ WATCH",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, the gentleman mentioned the main road from Baghdad and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) indicated earlier tonight that we have been holding this Iraq Watch special order for some period of months now. Those who have listened to us before may recall that I have mentioned in the past that I was privileged to be in the first delegation of American Congress Members who were able to get into Iraq, leave the Baghdad airport and go into what is now the Green Zone in May after the initial attack on Baghdad.We were there in late May on the day that Ambassador Bremer took the reins of control from General Garner. Forgive me for going over some past ground, but, unfortunately, what is being cited by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) and by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Strickland) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) tonight requires this for a very simple reason.When we hear of standing up or creating this Army, creating these forces, that was the goal that was stated to us the very first day that Ambassador Bremer was there, supposedly based on the work that General Garner was supposed to be doing up to that time. And we continue to have reports in the presses as if this is something suddenly just discovered.On that day, we sat at the table with Ambassador Bremer and General Garner. I recall very clearly saying to them, we have just been down this road from the airport, the international airport in Baghdad here, and I said to them. You are going to need 10,000 soldiers just to guard that highway. I said. It is a strip of tar going from the airport in the middle of a desert into Baghdad. This is not the Big Dig up in Boston or entering metropolitan Atlanta. This is not finding your way around Philadelphia or New York. This is a strip of tar from another big strip of tar where planes land into Baghdad. I said, there are no lights. There is no possibility of being able to stop people planting mines or coming up with shoulder-held rocket grenade launchers, explosive propellants of all kinds.And now here we are nearing the end of 2004, and you cannot even go on that road today. This is a debacle. This is a disaster. This is taking place right now in circumstances in which we are observing generals saying to their troops, witnessed by embedded reporters with television cameras, drawing the analogy to Hue in Vietnam.I am old enough to have been involved in the discussions that took place during the 1960s with what we were doing in Vietnam with a half a million soldiers and an indigenous Army fighting with the South Vietnamese that could fight, that was trained and was equipped. And the analogy was Hue in Vietnam. Fallujah is going to be like Hue. Hue was a disaster for us. A few more wins like that, and we are completely undone.What we forget is the actual military activity that took place had nothing to do with the war in the sense of whether or not we would be successful politically or militarily. The actual circumstances of the combat and the capabilities of the soldiers, all of which have been cited by us over and over again, that is not the issue. The competency of the American soldier is not the issue. The willingness of the American soldier to fight or the bravery, the professionalism, that is not the issue as such. Whether they are equipped properly, of course, that is an issue for us, but the political reality is this is an unmitigated disaster. We are setting the foundation and groundwork, if you will, for decades, if not centuries, of opposition to us as a result of what is going on right now.You need only go to look at how it is characterized around the country. I was visiting with my mother in Florida, and I have been to Massachusetts. I have gone all over the country. The Palm Beach Post, the Providence Journal, how is it characterized? Here is what the Providence Journal said on Monday, November 15.``The absence of insurgent bodies in Fallujah has remained an enduring mystery.'' It is no mystery. This is a guerilla fight.In the same paper:``But much of the city lay in smoking ruins. Isolated bands of rebels still harassed American and Iraqi soldiers.'' Rebels against what? ``The military victory appeared to be nearly overshadowed by insurgent violence elsewhere, particularly in the northern city of Mosul.''Again quoting:``The Governor of Mosul province, saying he had lost faith in local security forces, called in thousands of Kurdish militiamen for the first time to quell the insurgent uprising there.''Today a hearing was held on the staffing requirements, the personnel requirements for the Guard and the Reserve, testimony at the Committee on Armed Services today. Happy faces, it was characterized to me by a Republican Member here tonight, a stalwart member of the committee. And I reiterate again with respect to the many times we have appeared on the floor, this is not a Republican versus Democratic issue. The Committee on Armed Services tries not to operate in that kind of a context. We try to operate on the basis of the security interests of the United States. One of our colleagues said to us, ``They put on happy faces today.'' What the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) has just quoted, what these other two of my colleagues here have been quoting is that we are living in a fantasy. I was asked by a former Member today, What are you doing over at the Capitol? I said, We're organizing our delusions. We are in the midst of organizing our delusions.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my late colleague Robert T. Matsui. While his life was cut tragically short, his many achievements and contributions to our Nation will serve as a constant reminder of his hard work, integrity, and determination to advocate for those who were not able to fight for themselves.Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1978, Bob served the people of Sacramento for 14 terms focusing on the city's public safety by bringing adequate flood protection to his hometown. He also served as a senior member of the Committee on Ways and Means, covering an array of policy issues such as preserving Social Security for future generations, as well as having adequate basic healthcare rights for children. Most recently he served as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee leading the Democratic Party's congressional effort for the 2004 cycle.When he was 6 months old, Bob, a third-generation Japanese American, and his family were taken from their home in Sacramento and interned at the Tule Lake Camp after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1942. He carried this experience with him throughout his life. In 1988, he helped steer the Japanese-American Redress Act through Congress, in which the government formally apologized for the World War II internment program and offered compensation to victims. This experience helped shape his strong belief that every American is entitled to basic civil rights despite their ethnicity.Bob was also a member of the Executive Committee of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. Because of his many achievements and contributions, he was and always will be a role model to the more than eleven million Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent in our country.His presence and driving force will certainly be missed. However, his legacy will live on through the people of Sacramento, the Asian Pacific Islander American community and our Nation as a whole. I offer my deepest condolences to his wife, Doris, son, Brian, daughter-in-law, Amy and granddaughter, Anna. We will miss you, Bob. All Hawaii sends with you on your final journey our deepest and most loving Aloha.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, the sheer weight of logic plus our considerable mutual charm I think has some hope in that direction.Mr. Chairman, I rise today in favor of this amendment. Please allow me to say two things before I proceed. First, I want to express my gratitude to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) and to the gentleman from California (Mr. Pombo) and their committee staffs. Believe me, a lot of work went into this in the midst of all of the other pressures of various other items that were before them. This means a great deal.In every one of these bills, particularly in this energy bill, people have things to which they are deeply committed, including my good friend, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake), with respect to both the philosophy involved and what the consequences might be from any given item.Now, in the great scheme of things, this might not seem like a lot to a lot of people, but for those of us who understand what it is, if we can actually grow our own renewable energy with sugarcane in the form of biomass can actually provide by being converted to ethanol. That is why this is here.I am not certain, and the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case) will speak shortly about it too, as to whether there are larger, logistical issues involved or political issues. But I can tell my colleagues this: Whatever arguments there are out there about whether sufficient time or funds are being committed to renewable energy, alternative energy, this is something that we can do. And this is something where we are getting support from the oil and gas companies in Texas, in Louisiana.Hawaii and Florida can join in, because we are growing sugarcane, sugarcane can become ethanol, ethanol can help reduce the dependency on oil and gas. And we can work with the oil and gas companies to see to it that we have blends that will allow us to reduce our dependency on foreign oil, on foreign sources. That is what this is about.We can grow our own energy in Hawaii if we get the chance to do this. And the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Pombo) have recognized this. They are going to give us the chance, and if this works, I am in contact with people, for example, like at Southern University in Louisiana, just speaking with them tonight, with the idea that perhaps we can take the sugarcane industry, and instead of always having to be in the position of having to defend ourselves against wage slavery around the rest of the world, that we will be able to have good jobs, good income in the United States of America, and be growing our own energy. That is what this is about, and that is why I ask for the support of my colleagues on this.",

I do not think so. You are not saving any money that way. That is not going to work.But I would be happy some other time perhaps to have a full blown discussion about this at another point.Chairman Dreier, Ranking Member Slaughter and the Members of the Committee on Rules. I offer this amendment to H.R. 6 with the hope of reducing our nation's reliance on oil and advancing our efforts in Hawaii to become more energy self- sufficient. This is philosophically consistent with other provisions of H.R. 6 encouraging energy production. My amendment authorizes a 3-year demonstration program for the production of ethanol from sugar cane in Hawaii. Specifically, $8.0 million would fund a $1.00 per gallon payment to refiners and 8.0 million gallons of ethanol fuel. This pilot program would parallel the existing corn program to show that the process can be applicable to cane sugar and can be replicated on a larger scale. Nationally, the sugar cane industry is currently formulating a program to process 700,000 tons of cane sugar into ethanol. With a large domestic surplus of sugar, and the possibility of additional imported sugar being allowed into the domestic market through free trade agreements, a program of such size would stabilize domestic markets and produce a significant volume of ethanol. This pilot project will provide invaluable insight on problems that may arise with a national program. The State of Hawaii has passed a law that goes into effect on April 1, 2006, mandating a 10 percent ethanol blend for gasoline consumption in the state. Oil refineries are building ethanol storage and blending facilities in anticipation of meeting the requirement. Locally produced ethanol would be less expensive than importing the estimated 45 million gallons of ethanol needed to fulfill the 10 percent requirement. Because of the relatively low domestic price of sugar, Hawaii producers for some time been considering and now planning ethanol production from the cane sugar that would otherwise have gone into the domestic sugar market. The State of Hawaii is prepared to take advantage of this within months. However, this amendment is also supported by the other sugar cane growers who would like to identify any problems that might result from the large scale production of sugar cane ethanol. This amendment was developed after the House Energy and Commerce Committee completed its markup but the amendment has been signed off by the majority side of the Energy Committee. I urge my colleagues to allow floor debate on this demonstration project and rule this amendment in order. Thank you very mush for your consideration.Mr. Chairman, I yield my remaining time to the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case).The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Hawaii is recognized for 1\\1/2\\ minutes.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) to recognize May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. As a member of the caucus' executive committee and the chairman of its Immigration Task Force, I want to honor the many achievements and contributions of the more than thirteen million Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent in our country.Back in 1978, my friends and colleagues, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, former Senator Spark Matsunaga, former Representative Frank Horton and former Representative Norm Mineta helped establish the first 10 days of May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Week. Subsequent efforts were made to extend the week-long celebration to a month-long event. In the 102nd Congress, I was an original cosponsor of legislation signed into law that designated May of each year as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.I am blessed to serve the First Congressional District of Hawaii which is comprised primarily of Asian Pacific Americans (APA). It's an inspiring and empowering sight for other APAs from around the country to see. I know I say this every year, but I feel that it needs to be repeated. There is a special strength and resilience embodied in Hawaii's unique cultural mix: we have chosen to be defined by our diversity rather than divided by our differences. That resolve to work together with Aloha can serve as an example to the rest of the country.While we can look at APA Heritage Month as a time to recognize and celebrate many individual accomplishments, we must also take action. My colleagues and I are committed to improving the lives of all APAs by working on issues of importance to our community, such as fighting to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities, defending civil liberties, protecting Social Security, and ensuring educational opportunities for our children. These are the principles that reflect this year's theme, ``Liberty and Freedom for All.''This year's theme represents the past and ongoing contributions of APAs, such as Congresswoman Patsy T. Mink who dedicated her life to economic and social justice, Congressman Robert Matsui, who's internment experience during World War II helped shape his belief that every American is entitled to basic civil rights despite their ethnicity, and Japanese American soldiers who fought during World War II, such as Senator Daniel K. Inouye.Throughout our nation's history, APAs have made and continue to make major contributions in areas such as business, civil liberties, culture and arts, education, medicine, technology and politics. By the year 2050, there will be an estimated 33.4 million U.S. residents who will identify themselves as Asian alone, which will comprise 8 percent of the total population. This is a projected 213 percent increase of APAs between 2000 and 2050. These statistics reflect the growing significance of the APA community, its growing role in the development of public policy, and its cultural contributions that helps us to celebrate our diversities. I extend my heartfelt aloha to the APA community and look forward to celebrating APA Heritage Month.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Arc of Hilo and Lanakila for their hard work and dedication in improving the quality of life for people with developmental or other disabilities in Hawaii. I also want to pay tribute to the many achievements and contributions of Michael Gleason, the Arc of Hilo's executive director, and Marian Tsuji, President/CEO of Lanakila. The Arc of Hilo and Lanakila are a Javits-Wagner-O'Day Program (often referred to as JWOD), which provides job skills and training to those who are blind or who have other severe disabilities so they may earn good wages and benefits and gain a greater independence and the quality of life. Overall, the JWOD program empowers people with disabilities who traditionally face an unemployment rate of 70 percent and rely heavily on social support programs such as welfare and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).The Arc of Hilo's mission is to improve the quality of life for people with developmental and other disabilities in Hawaii through educational, recreational, vocational, and skill training as well as employment and residential opportunities. Lanakila's mission is to offer programs and services for adults with cognitive, physical, social or age-related challenges that build and support higher levels of independence and an improved quality of life. By employing people who are blind or who have other severe disabilities, the Arc of Hilo and Lanakila are able to increase independence and self-esteem by helping these individuals enjoy full participation in their communities and market their JWOD skills to other public/private sector employers.Demonstrating an excellent federal-private sector partnership, NISH, NIB, and local nonprofits such as the Arc of Hilo and Lanakila enhance the opportunities for economic and personal independence of people who are blind or who have other severe disabilities, primarily through creating, sustaining, and improving employment. Through the JWOD program, the Arc of Hilo provides employment opportunities and training for 60 people with visual and other severe disabilities enabling them to lead more productive and meaningful lives, support their families, and gain important work experience.Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the important contributions of the Arc of Hilo and Lanakila in the great aloha state of Hawaii. I commend all persons who are committed to and work towards enhancing employment opportunities for people with visual and other severe disabilities.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield on that point, my intention is not to take up time necessarily on Iraq Watch on the question of H.J. Res. 55, the joint resolution number 55, but that is the tangible substance of the commitment of the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) and others at this point, including myself, to try to put legislation forward that will respond precisely to the commentary that the gentleman from Connecticut found in his West Hartford meeting.The resolution asks the President to develop and implement a plan for the withdrawal of the United States Armed Forces from Iraq. It makes a reference, the short version of it, joint resolution 55, as Homeward Bound. The principal point here, rather than going over it point by point, the principal point in the context established tonight, and I am referring to one of two findings here, is that the United States has in place a timetable for training, equipping and employing Iraqi security forces to take over the counterinsurgency mission from coalition forces. That is a statement of fact.Speaking as a member of the Committee on Armed Services, I can say to you in all candor and openness that we do have timetables. We do have timetables. We do have benchmarks. We do have indications and timelines for those indications of what constitutes success, what constitutes a capacity for the counterinsurgency mission to be taken from coalition forces by Iraqi forces of all kinds; from border police to interior ministry, to defense personnel police and armed forces.In order to explicate that clearly to the American people, this House passed, in overwhelming numbers, an emergency supplemental appropriations for defense, the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense on the global war on terror and tsunami relief. Public Law 109-13. In that, a joint explanatory statement accompanied the conference report, which required the Secretary of Defense to report not later than July 10.As we speak, it is now approximately 8:45 p.m. on the East Coast on July 19, some 9 days past the deadline established by the Congress of the United States, passed by Democrats and Republicans in overwhelming numbers. Not with this Member's vote, to be sure. But nonetheless, my position as enunciated then in opposition to it, to the bill, because I felt we were not carrying forward on what we said we were doing, nonetheless the overwhelming majority gave the Secretary of Defense the opportunity to report to us no later than July 10 and every 90 days thereafter on measures for security, political, and economic progress in Iraq.Mr. Speaker, I received a letter from the Secretary of Defense yesterday indicating they were working hard on this report. I have no doubt. But we are already 9 days late. We are already 9 days of more killings, more murders, more terrorism, more grievous wounding, more terrorism worldwide, and yet we do not have this report from the Secretary of Defense.My plea is that other Members and the audience that may be listening to us tonight take a look at House Joint Resolution 55 that has been developed on a bipartisan basis with one of the leading advocates being the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) and other Members of the Republican Party and Democratic Party as well. This is not an ideological construct, this is not a resolution made to embarrass the President. On the contrary, House Joint Resolution 55 in some respects has been characterized by some as saying what are you doing helping President Bush? We should be in opposition to President Bush, but I feel the politics will take care of itself in time to come. There is no question about that. We can make that point later. This resolution is about backing up our troops now on the mission they have accomplished, and to get the political side, the economic side, the civilian side of this moving forward the way we say it should be.So we set in this resolution the opportunity for the President to enunciate a plan commensurate with the time tables he has set for the establishment of a government in December, and to move forward with the troops that the Secretary of Defense himself has said are being trained so we can begin to withdraw, bring homeward bound our troops.So when people inquire of you what is it Congress is doing, we can look at H.J. Res. 55. It is not perfect. It is a legislative project. The only perfect set of rules, the only perfect legislation was the Ten Commandments, and I understand Moses took 40 days to do them. And as he came down the mountain he said, Well, I got them down to 10. That is what the legislative process is. You talk things over.So House Joint Resolution 55 is not a perfect vehicle, but it is a legislative vehicle to join with the President and make an offer to the President to join with us in the Congress in setting a timetable and plan for the withdrawal of these troops commensurate with the mission as enunciated by everyone.",

    "title": "HAWAII WATER RESOURCES ACT OF 2005",
    "text": "Madame Speaker, I rise today to support, S. 264, the Hawaii Water Resources Act of 2005. This legislation will authorize Federal funds for three urgently needed water projects in the State of Hawaii.Madame Speaker, several years ago our State suffered through 5 years of drought conditions. Due to dangerous drops in our water levels, water usage was restricted to prevent saltwater from entering our pumps. Today, there is no drought and water conservation measures continue to be taught in schools and publicized. However, these three water development projects will make tremendous strides in ensuring a stable water supply for our growing island State and conserve the limited water supplies we do have. Because of the importance of these projects, I introduced the companion measure, H.R. 843, and wholeheartedly support this legislation.H.R. 843/S. 264 would authorize three projects that would help the State of Hawaii implement long-term management plans for our most limited natural resource, fresh water. The Kalaeloa Desalination Project would be built on Oahu, home to 72 percent of the State's population. It is estimated that water use rates on this island will begin exceeding recharge rates in 2018. This problem is particularly evident on the western side of Oahu which has a secondary urban center, Kapolei, which has experienced a population explosion in recent years. Kapolei is a planned community whose population is expected to increase by 70 percent in the next 20 years. The Board of Water Supply for the City and County of Honolulu has successfully implemented conservation measures and special programs which have lowered water consumption. This project would help meet Kapolei's projected demand, conserve limited groundwater, avoid impacts to the environment from wells drilled in forested watersheds, increase system reliability and minimize saltwater intrusion when water levels drop in drought conditions--Oahu experienced a 5-year drought from 1998 to 2002. This facility would also be capable of future expansion, an important aspect for this heavily populated island.The second project is located on the western side of the big island of Hawaii. This area sees very little rainfall and is very similar to the high arid regions of the mainland United States. The Kealakehe Wastewater Treatment Project would utilize wetlands to naturally clean the effluent being discharged by the Kealakehe Wastewater Treatment Plant. Once the effluent water quality is upgraded and the maximum amount of flow diverted for use onsite in the wetlands, a distribution system would then convey the recycled water to potential users. A conventional tertiary treatment system would be cost prohibitive for a facility of this size. Moreover, the discharge of treated water could lead to the degradation of coastal water quality in an area that is known for its beautiful beaches and is a popular tourist destination. This project is an ecologically friendly alternative that would also provide habitat for two endangered bird species which are currently nesting on land adjacent to the Keahole International Airport.The third project that would be authorized is the Lahaina Recycled Water Distribution System Expansion Project located on the island of Maui. Over the last decade, Maui has worked to build a solid foundation for a water recycling program. Currently, it is able to use approximately 25 percent of the recycled water it produces, about 4 million gallons per day. The main impediment to using more recycled water is the lack of infrastructure to distribute the recycled water to the commercial enterprises that could use it. A key example of this problem is in West Maui where recycled water is used to irrigate the Kaanapali Golf Courses. The pipeline that leads to the golf courses also passes a number of other commercial enterprises that are interested in using recycled water but the infrastructure is not adequately developed to allow these properties to connect to the system. Authorizing this project for Federal assistance will allow for expansion at a much faster rate and result in a greater savings of potable water.The State of Hawaii is addressing its problems of limited water and trying to implement solutions. The next time a drought comes, it may be too late to act. This bill will help us protect Hawaii's environment, meet our growing water needs, and maintain our quality of life. I urge my colleagues to support this vitally important measure.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Gerald K. Sumida as he retires after serving nearly 23 years as Program Director of the Hawaii Senior Companion Program (SCP).Gerald's career with the Hawaii state government began in July 1975, where he worked in the then Corrections Division and the Adult Services Unit of the then Department of Social Services and Housing. On March 16, 1983, he began his tenure with SCP and has dedicated his time and compassion in helping improve the lives of our beloved kupuna or elders. Under the direction of Gerald, the SCP and the Respite Companion Service Program (RCSP) have gained the recognition and respectability in the aging community.Through Gerald's guidance the Senior Companion Program has expanded its senior companion services to include Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Molokai, Lanai, and Kauai. Gerald's tireless efforts have provided Hawaii the opportunity to be continually blessed with two federally funded programs providing much needed services to the frail elderly population. Through Gerald's foresight, the SCP and RCSP have continued to improve the quality of life for thousands of frail elderly individuals, and the RCSP has provided hundreds of its participants the opportunity for unsubsidized employment as ``older workers'' in today's workforce.Gerald's gentle and compassionate nature has given many elderly low-income individuals, with limited resources and command of the English language, hope and encouragement to become productive seniors in the community. He will truly be missed at the Hawaii Senior Companion Program, but I believe that he will remain an active member of the community. Mahalo nui loa for all of your hard work, Gerald!

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, this legislation may seem a bit esoteric to some not only in Congress here but in the public at large. But this issue, and I want to commend you and the ranking member for bringing it to our attention, this legislation could not be more crucial in terms of what our national responsibilities are.Boxing and some of the so-called sports that are now associated with physical contact, things called the extreme sports, are interstate in nature, almost by definition. And because they are interstate, without regulation or oversight by the Congress, that means that many of the people associated with, in particular in this instance, the boxers, are in a sense victimized by our failure to take this up as a national question.The stories may be instructive that are associated with boxing and boxing history. They may be even redemptive in terms of our contemplation of them: People struggling up from the bottom of the economic and social scale, sometimes tragic in nature in terms of those that have succeeded, and then are undone by success. For example, it is well known that the great heavyweight challenger Joe Louis Barrow was considered not only a great champion and a great personality, but was associated in many people's minds symbolically with being able to rise above race to be a symbol for brotherhood, someone who sacrificed financially for the United States by joining the Army during the war. And his reward was to be persecuted by the Internal Revenue Service for not paying taxes on purses and funds that he earned during that period of time. As a result, it had tragic dimensions for him in later life.These kinds of stories can be replicated over and over again throughout the history of boxing. So what we have right now is the opportunity, Mr. Chairman, for us to put together a commission that will deal with some of the fundamental issues within the purview of the Congress in terms of interstate regulation.This has to do with health care and the capacity to see to it that anybody engaged in boxing has access to and provision for health care and for pensions for that time when they have to retire. There is no reason why a percentage of every purse cannot be put into some kind of fund that will guarantee a pension and access to a pension for those engaged in boxing.We have had great champions in Hawaii. Everyone has a story in this regard, Stan Harrington and Bobo Olson, some of the folks that I had an opportunity to know, and some of our champions right now, and potential champions in Hawaii and elsewhere across the country. I ask that everyone give us a chance to move this legislation along so we can complete the opportunity that is before us.",

    "title": "ESTABLISHING A MEMORIAL WITHIN KALAUPAPA NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill introduced by my colleague, Representative Ed Case. His bill to establish a memorial within Kalaupapa National Historical Park would serve to honor and perpetuate the memory of those individuals who were forcibly relocated to the Kalaupapa Peninsula from 1866-1969.The sad history of Kalaupapa is well known within the State of Hawaii. Two tragedies occurred on the Kalaupapa Peninsula on the north shore of the island of Moloka`i. The first is the removal of indigenous people in 1865 and 1895. The removal of Hawaiians from where they had lived for 900 years cut the cultural ties and associations of generations of people from the `aina (land).The second tragedy is the forced isolation of sick people to this remote place from 1866 until 1969. The establishment of an isolation settlement, first at Kalawao and then at Kalaupapa, tore apart Hawaiian society as the Kingdom of Hawaii, and subsequently the territory of Hawai`i, tried to control the feared disease of leprosy, now known as Hansen's disease. The impact of broken connections with the `aina and of family members ``lost'' to Kalaupapa are still felt in Hawai`i today.Kalaupapa National Historical Park, established in 1980, contains the physical setting for these stories. Within its boundaries are the historic Hansen's disease settlements of Kalaupapa and Kalawao. The community of Kalaupapa, on the leeward side of Kalaupapa Peninsula, is still home for many surviving Hansen's disease patients, whose memories and experiences are cherished values. In Kalawao on the windward side of the peninsula are the churches of Siloama, established in 1866, and Saint Philomena, associated with the work of Father Damien (Joseph De Veuster), a great humanitarian who gave his life to minister to the physical and spiritual needs of those banished to the settlement.Kalaupapa retains the memories and spirit of all those who lived there. Someday, the last Hansen's disease patient living in Kalaupapa will pass away. A memorial will be a permanent tribute to the brave souls who called Kalaupapa home. I support this legislation and hope my colleagues will also extend their support.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I would like to amplify my formal statement with a few personal observations. The chairman has kindly indicated some of the history of Senator Fong. It is interesting when I look down and see the word Hiram L. Fong, because he is so much of the history of Hawaii, we all think of him as Senator Fong.As has been noted, he was the seventh of 11 children of an immigrant family. If there was ever a story of Hawaii, of our rainbow people and our aloha spirit, it is Hiram Fong. He worked a lot of jobs and worked his way through school and did very, very well. He founded not only a prominent law firm but founded as well what became a financial empire.I have some real interest in it because the very first campaign that I ever ran was funded by Senator Fong's Finance Factors. I went down to get a loan. I thought if I was going to run against him, I thought the least I could do, in the spirit of bipartisanship, was to ask him to help fund my campaign. As a graduate student at the University of Hawaii, I went down to borrow $50. They said we cannot lend you $50, we have to lend you $200 if we are going to make any money on this. So I said, I will take it. I was able to run my very first campaign on Hiram Fong's dime, although I should say nickel, because that is what I passed out in the streets of Honolulu to represent the inflation that I thought we were going to have to deal with in those days. That was an innocent time.Senator Fong was always gracious. Senator Fong was always able to reach out. As has been noted, he was elected as a Republican in a very Democratic State. He was supported in great measure and elected in great measure with the support of labor in Hawaii. Most particularly, the ILWU, the International Longshoremen Workers Union, testifying in favor of the establishment of a commission in 2005, after he passed away, to honor and recognize him as a political, business and community leader testified, ``The Senator was a successful businessman and a Republican who never forgot his humble beginnings. He was a strong supporter of civil rights and often crossed the aisle to cooperate on issues important to Hawaii's unions and workers.''Senator Hiram Fong came to the United States Senate with the arrival of Hawaii as the last State of the Union. Probably nothing could be more fitting than to recognize him today through this legislation and the pioneer effort that he made. Yes, the last State to enter the Union had as its first Senator the son of an immigrant family who came from China looking for opportunity, looking for justice, and found it in the person of their son, and a true son of Hawaii, Hiram Fong.",

    "title": "COMMENDING THE PEOPLE OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS FOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND SACRIFICES THEY MADE TO THE UNITED STATES NUCLEAR TESTING PROGRAM IN THE MARSHALL ISLANDS",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 692, a resolution to commend the people of the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the contributions and grave sacrifices they made to the United States nuclear testing program in the Marshall Islands.In 1947, the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) became one of six entities in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands established by the United Nations with the U.S. as the Trustee. This began a decades-long relationship between the U.S. and RMI that has proven to be resilient and enduring.In particular, I'd like to highlight the U.S. nuclear testing program in RMI which began in 1946. Over the years, the U.S. detonated 67 nuclear weapons on the islands of Bikini and Enewetak. These tests comprise 80 percent of all atmospheric tests conducted by the United States. On March 1, 1954, the hydrogen weapons test code-named ``Bravo'' yielded explosive power approximately 1,000 times greater than the weapon used in the 1945 wartime nuclear attack on Hiroshima, Japan. The Bravo test created a mushroom cloud 25 miles in diameter, produced a crater 6,000 feet in diameter, and vaporized 6 islands at the Bikini Atoll. Radiation from the test forced the evacuation of Marshallese and U.S. military personnel on Rongelap, Rongerik, Utirik and Ailinginae. This responsibility shouldered by the Marshallese people allowed a majority of all tests to be conducted as far from densely populated areas as possible and helped bring about a peaceful end to the Cold War.Over the years, the Marshallese have faced very serious consequences as a result of the nuclear testing. The health and property effects have proved to be extensive and in many cases, immeasurable. The U.S. has recognized this and set up a fund to compensate those affected by the testing. However, the consequences of this testing, especially the health of the Marshallese people, continue to be impacted. In particular, the Section 177 Health Care Program is in urgent need of increased funding. Intended to provide comprehensive medical care, including cancer care, for the four communities most affected by the nuclear weapons testing program, this healthcare program has fallen woefully short of its intended goals. Spending approximately $12 per patient per month, the needs of this program are immediate and urgent.Mr. Speaker, I am sure that our countries will continue to work on this issue and find a resolution. I also have no doubt that the relationship between our governments will continue to be productive and mutually beneficial. As our alliance continues in the coming decades, I urge the United States to step up and meet its obligations to the people of the RMI. With all the sacrifices they have made for the United States and continue to make each day, it is the very least the United States can do.I urge my colleagues to join me in commending the people of the Marshall Islands and acknowledge their profound sacrifices. We must continue our efforts to restore the health and lands of the people of the Marshall Islands.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Hunter and Mr. Skelton for the opportunity. I stand here today in support of the bill moving forward, but I have a caveat that I hope will be able to be addressed before we come to a final conclusion.As the chairman knows, my original opposition was to what has been termed the ``bridge fund''; upon reconsideration, I have become a strong advocate of it. For those not familiar with it, the bridge fund is a legitimate methodology for the authorizing committee to deal with the actual cost of deployments of our Armed Forces throughout the world.Presently, the bridge fund will deal only with approximately 6 months' worth of costs associated, expenditures associated, with these deployments. As a result then we will have to take up yet another supplemental budget, probably just after the first of the year, within a month or so, and that will, in turn, find us dealing with other requests, other emergencies, that will be included in this so-called supplemental budget. It is not an emergency that we need funding for for our deployments overseas, but rather an admission and an acknowledgment of the true costs of these deployments overseas.So, Mr. Chairman, I most certainly urge that we move the bill along and, at the same time, then take up this question of being straightforward and honest with the American people as to what the true costs are of our deployments and to see to it that the military does not have to cannibalize the existing budget and take us away from what I consider 100 percent support of the troops 50 percent of the time.I believe, even though I am in opposition to much of what is the foundation for support, the irony in this is that those like myself who did not support the effort in Iraq as undertaken and have serious reservations about how the war is being conducted, the military action is being conducted in Afghanistan, are actually being sustained in our position; rather than finding support for those who originally were for the war in Iraq or think that we are doing the right thing in Afghanistan, that position is being undermined because we are not being straightforward with people as to what the true costs are.There is a case of unease in the American public, I think, with regard to our present policies in Iraq and Afghanistan because we do not have a straightforward, honest approach with the American people as to what the costs are. I believe the American people will pay any costs to protect our security if they feel that we are being honest and straightforward about it.We need to do that. We need to bring the bridge fund in our authorization up to the actual cost, and not undermine the good work that has been on this bill this year.Mr. Chairman, as the ranking minority member of the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee of the HASC, I am pleased to support H.R. 5122. I also want to commend my chairman and partner on the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee, Congressman Kurt Weldon, for his nonpartisan approach to our subcommittee's portion' of this bill.The procurement and research portions of this bill that the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee oversees strikes an effective balance between getting our troops the equipment they need, ensuring that the equipment works, and ensuring that it is all acquired at a price the Nation can afford. Striking this balance is always difficult, but given the pressure on the DOD budget from the war in Iraq, this was an especially challenging year. I am pleased to support the procurement and research aspects of this bill as a good-government approach to making tough decisions when funds are limited.This bill is a significant improvement over the procurement and research budget presented by the President in two critical ways. First, it is a more straightforward document that lays out what the committee decided the military's priorities should be, and what funding these priorities will actually cost. Second, it shifts funding from programs that are simply not working and moves those funds to programs that are working and are delivering effective equipment to the troops in the field today. With troops in combat the Congress has a non-negotiable obligation to weigh in heavily on the side of immediate and near-term needs of the military.There are two programs that this bill takes some significant funding away from, and I want to address the committee's reasoning on these reductions, because they were both difficult decisions. The first is the Army's Future Combat System, which this bill cuts by $325 million.I want to be clear that this is not a move to punish the Army. Everyone on this committee recognizes that the Army is carrying the heaviest burden in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in terms lives lost and dollars spent. Every member of this committee also wants to ensure we have an Army that is ready today and prepared for the challenges of the future. The problem is that the Army simply has too many bills to pay and not enough funding to cover all of them. Difficult choices had to be made.The second program cut is to the VH-71 ``Presidential Helicopter'' program. This rather modest cut is based on the committee's concern that this program is being pushed too fast and is taking test and development risks that are clearly not appropriate and could be outright dangerous. I want to make it absolutely clear that the goal of this cut and some language in the bill is not to kill the program, or even scale back its size. Instead, it is a reflection of this committee's support for the principle of ``fly before you buy'' that must be followed, especially for a helicopter the President of the United States is going to fly in.Given the demands of an ongoing war and the need to continue to buy and develop new equipment, this bill strikes an appropriate balance given the funding available.Despite my support for the bill, I did want to caveat that support in one important aspect: the lack of an authorization in this bill for the full-year cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.In each of the past two years, the Congress has put some of the funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through the normal authorization and appropriations process. The rest of the funding for the year, however, has come through very large supplemental appropriations bills that the Armed Services Committee has been unable to oversee properly.I have supported all of the Defense authorization and Defense Appropriations bills done under our normal budget procedures since the war in Iraq began. Putting the money in the normal budget would be best, but the ``bridge fund'' mechanism in the legislation before us today is arguably a reasonable middle ground between funding purely through supplementals and the normal budget process. Chairman Hunter deserves credit for coming up with this more honest approach.This year, for whatever reason, the Administration only requested $50 billion in additional funding in FY 2007 for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This total is reflected in the bill as reported by the committee. During committee consideration of this bill, I had an amendment that sought to increase the amount of the bridge fund to $92 billion so that it would reflect the likely full-year cost of combat operations overseas. Unfortunately this amendment was voted down by the majority.Having a more realistic full-year figure in this bill would have improved this legislation's relevance and honesty. The troops overseas and the American people deserve to know what our best estimate of the cost of these wars will be in 2007.Continuing to rely on massive supplemental, so-called ``emergency'' spending bills to pay for the war is both dishonest and fiscally unsound. I believe that the American people are willing to sacrifice to get the troops the funds they need, but instead of asking all Americans to sacrifice we are instead using a budget shell game to hide the real cost of the war. This shell game also allows massive tax cuts for the wealthy during a war which we are borrowing money from other nations to pay for. Funding the war in this manner is saddling our children and grandchildren with a massive debt that they will have to payoff in the future.Overall, the bill before us today is a good bill, but choosing to only authorize 6 months of funding for the troops in the field is like saying to them that the Congress supports you 100 percent for 50 percent of the year. I do not think that is the message that the House wants to send.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, it is clear that the principal issue that is going to be before us as we deal with the overall bill is going to be the lifting of the moratorium, the congressional moratorium with respect to drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf.As a supporter of a bill that Mr. Peterson and I hoped to have heard in the Resources Committee that will deal with the issue in a much broader scope, I hope I can bring some level of reality here to what this is all about.Mr. Chairman, it is the quite true, as has been mentioned by previous speakers who want to see this amendment taken out of the overall bill, that 25 years ago the question of drilling 3 miles off of Florida or California or anywhere was an issue, and the reason that the moratorium was put in was to prevent that from happening. But that was 25 years ago, and now the issue is up for reconsideration, not to drill 3 miles, but whether there is going to be any drilling at all and whether it should take place and under what circumstances, given what has happened over the past 25 years.The reason the Peterson amendment is in the overall bill is to give us the opportunity to start that discussion. There will be no drilling off of Florida or anyplace else if we pass this bill. It just gives us the opportunity to begin a discussion as to whether we should reconsider that position and where it should happen. That is what is at issue here, lifting the congressional moratorium. There is still a Presidential moratorium against it; there is still a 5-year plan that has to be implemented. We need to consider whether we want to continue with that particular approach.So what we are asking for is every Member here to be able to vote his or her own views on whether we can have a discussion on this issue. Our problem, Mr. Chairman, is, particularly for those of us who are Democrats, that we are in the grip now of an assault by an environmental Taliban out there that has absolute revealed wisdom as to what is involved with us trying to achieve an independent energy source that we can have as an alternative energy source right now in our country, and not be in the grip of people around the world who wish us ill with regard to energy.All we are asking for is the opportunity to be able to discuss this issue. If we defeat the Peterson amendment or have it taken out and pass the Capps-Putnam amendment and whatever other amendments are associated with it, we won't have the chance to even begin a discussion about whether natural gas is an alternative independent source of energy that we need to have now.That is what our request is. Let us have this discussion. Keep the Peterson amendment in the bill so we can begin the discussion and have the hearings that Mr. Davis and others indicated they would like to have. I agree with them. I think Members know me for a long time, I would never try to embarrass somebody else or put somebody else in a position of saying, look, I am right and you are wrong and I have the only position possible. That is not what it is about. We need to have this discussion. Let us defeat the Capps-Putnam amendment so that we can have this discussion. Mr. Chairman, I hope that everybody understands this is not a Democratic-Republican issue; this is an American issue about independent energy resources for this Nation.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support Congressman Melancon's motion to instruct conferees on H.R. 2864. This motion would direct conferees to accept provisions that will protect coastal communities in Louisiana and Mississippi from the storm surge of a category 5 hurricane.Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf on August 29, 2005, and was a category 3 hurricane that did not even directly hit the affected areas.Yet, Katrina was able to inflict monstrous and unimaginable damage upon Louisiana and the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. One year after Hurricane Katrina, the area remains a terrible, twisted portrait of lives and families and whole communities washed away; home by home, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood.As a result of Hurricane Katrina:More than 1,000 people died.The total number of immediately displaced people has never been determined. Estimates range from the hundreds of thousands to the millions.The Louisiana parishes of Orleans and St. Bernard were especially hard hit by flooding, with an estimated 77% of Orleans's population affected, and nearly all residents of St. Bernard.In Mississippi, 55% of Hancock County's population is estimated to have been affected by flooding and/or structural damage.In the greater New Orleans area alone, there were 160,000 homes and apartments destroyed or heavily damaged by the storm.The metro New Orleans area has lost approximately 400,000 residents.The National Flood Insurance Program has paid out $17 billion in property damage claims in Louisiana alone, only a fraction of total damage.Hospital capacity in Orleans parish dropped in half immediately after the storm. In St. Bernard, there are still no hospitals open.The Army Corps of Engineers has only begun to raise sinking levees and deal with unfinished hurricane protection and flood prevention projects. But, they're only rebuilding the levees to withstand a Category 3 storm, Katrina's level. Prudent planning and common sense would dictate that they be raised to Category 5 levels to protect the more than two million residents along these coasts.I urge my colleagues to support and vote for this motion to instruct.",

    "title": "INTRODUCING THE HAWAIIAN HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2006",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of legislation I am proud to introduce today. The Hawaiian Homeownership Opportunity Act of 2006 is the exact same language of HR 5851, reported out of the House Financial Services Committee on September 28, 2006.The measure reauthorizes existing Native Hawaiian housing programs for five years and makes two adjustments to the program that will allow the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands to help more Native Hawaiians whose incomes are equal to or less than 80 percent of the median income.In 2000 Congress passed legislation authorizing the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide block grants for affordable housing for Native Hawaiians through the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. The 2000 measure also authorized HUD home loan guarantees for low-income Native Hawaiians. Eligible borrowers include Native Hawaiian families, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, and private nonprofit organizations experienced in planning and developing affordable housing for Native Hawaiians.The Hawaiian Home Ownership Opportunity Act of 2006 reauthorizes these programs and adds a new provision authorizing loan guarantees for home mortgage refinancing. This introduces greater flexibility and allows families to take advantage of lower interest rates as millions of other American families have. The measure would also permit the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands to issue bonds. This will allow the Department to service more low-income families without a large increase in appropriations.This bill is about homeownership, this is not welfare or public assistance. It offers another tool for a family to provide for a basic need, housing. This is unbelieveably important in Hawaii where land is scarce and the median home price on the island of Oahu is $639,000 and the median condominium price is $310,000. This measure will advance our efforts to address housing affordability in the islands.I would like to thank the House Financial Services Committee, in particular Chairman Mike Oxley and Ranking Member Barney Frank, who have been extremely supportive in dealing with the housing problems of Hawaii. I would also like to recognize my colleague from Hawaii, Congressman Ed Case, who, like Chairman Oxley and Ranking Member Frank, is a cosponsor of this legislation.I urge my colleagues to help the residents of Hawaii and support this legislation.",

    "title": "JOHN WARNER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2007",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this year's National Defense Authorization Act. It includes many provisions that are vital to giving our military the tools it needs to defend the nation, although it also leaves much work undone that will have to be addressed in the future.The bill addresses one issue in particular that merits attention. Despite the Pentagon's repeated denials of a military readiness crisis, this bill authorizes an additional $23 billion in funding as a downpayment on the damage to the U.S. Army and Marine Corps from repeated and sustained deployments to Iraq, and the Bush Administration's decision to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through a parade of emergency supplemental appropriations. The wars themselves are wearing down our equipment at a tremendous rate. Further damage is done by supplemental appropriations because the military services are denied the funding they need in a timely and predictable fashion. These two factors are doing serious and longterm damage to the nation's military readiness, and the Congress must address them.During Armed Services Committee deliberations on this bill in March 2006, I offered an amendment to add $42 billion for this reason. Sadly, that amendment was voted down on a party-line vote. I offered the amendment because we had a growing readiness problem and because I thought putting as much of the funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as possible into the base budget was the most honest and effective way to proceed. My approach ended up in the final version of this bill. The $23 billion in this year's bill is a good start, but this funding will have to be sustained in many subsequent bills to address the readiness crisis we continue to face.I am also pleased that this bill includes many important legislative provisions that directly improve the lives of the people of my district and my state. First, it takes the first step toward dealing with the chemical munitions dumped off the coast of Hawaii in the 1940s. These weapons could still pose a serious health and environmental risk, and Section 314 of this bill requires a comprehensive research effort by the military to identify, analyze, and assess the potential threat these sites may pose.Section 2843 of this bill addresses a major land transfer issue in Hawaii regarding the former Barbers Point Naval Air Station. Affordable housing for the people of Hawaii and a new public transit system are critical local issues. This language requires the Navy to turn over an important parcel of land that will allow both new housing and transit development. Balancing the needs of the military and the local population in Hawaii is a challenge, but in this case, I think an arrangement was reached that helps both sides accomplish their goals. I want to thank Chairman Hunter and Chairman Hefley for working with me on this language.Lastly, Section 343 of the bill requires an analysis by the Army of its future live-fire training infrastructure needs in Hawaii. The Army's presence in Hawaii is undergoing tremendous change. A new Stryker Brigade is due to be activated this coming year, and thousands more troops will be coming to Hawaii as part of the larger changes in the military's Pacific region basing posture. Supporting these growing needs while accommodating the cultural, environmental and quality of life concerns of the people of Hawaii is essential. This report will help Congress understand where the Army wants to go in Hawaii with its training infrastructure, and how to get there. In particular, it will address the sensitive issue of the Army's long-term future in the Makua Valley, an area of Hawaii owned by the people of Hawaii and on temporary loan to the military. Eventually, this land must be returned, so the report requires the Army to look beyond its current use of the Makua Valley toward the eventual return of this historic and environmentally sensitive treasure to the people of Hawaii.There are critical quality of life issues that were not resolved. Specifically, it does not do enough to help military families who need the Survivor Benefit Program and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation offset repealed. For me, this is a basic issue of fairness that must be addressed at some point in the future. The bill does not do enough to protect TRICARE health insurance patients from skyrocketing prescription drug prices. The Department of Defense asked for legislative authority to negotiate lower prices with major drug companies. The majority was unwilling to let this provision into the final bill. Finally, the bill before us only provides a 2.2 percent pay raise for the military in 2007. This is meager thanks for our men and women in uniform in a time of war; for those who are experiencing sustained and repeated deployments and absences from their families.As well, this raise is simply too small to help our military families keep up with rising cost of living expenses at many bases around the nation, and especially in Hawaii. We have asked a lot from these men and women. We owe them more in return.I want to now turn to the portion of the bill that falls under the jurisdiction of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee, on which I am proud to serve as the ranking minority member. This year, the subcommittee had a daunting task: to reconcile a budget submission that was simply unrealistic in some respects when compared to the needs of the military both today and in the future.Our military is clearly being pulled in many directions at once. Today our forces are fighting unconventional wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the demands of which, in terms of equipment, are very different from possible future conventional conflicts. The U.S. military has to be able to fight and win both types of wars, but there is clearly not enough funding for doing everything the services want to do.This bill authorizes critical short-term needs such as modernization of Army equipment in combat today and increased production of aircraft like the C-17 that are absolutely vital to current military operations. The bill also looks to the future in continuing successful aviation and ground systems. Finally, it takes funding from a few programs that are off-track or not working and moves that funding to more pressing needs, ensuring that taxpayer dollars are not wasted.It also demands additional analysis and testing of systems in development that the subcommittee has concerns about. These provisions may discomfort some people at the Pentagon, but it is Congress' duty to oversee these programs and ensure that the troops get what they need.Overall, this year I think the subcommittee did an excellent job. I especially want to commend Chairman Weldon on his leadership of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee. His willingness to work in an open and nonpartisan manner greatly facilitates the subcommittee's work and produces a better product for our troops and the civilians who serve the nation at the Department of Defense.Finally, another member of this committee deserves special recognition. I worked for many years with Joel Hefley on the Armed Services Committee. He is a both a valued colleague and a close friend. Among his many accomplishments during his distinguished career on this committee, he helped shepherd through one of the most important changes in military housing construction in decades. His vision for leveraging private investment dollars into a massive new program to rebuild and rehabilitate military family housing is now a reality. In my state alone almost ten thousand military homes will be upgraded in the next few years. This housing is a vital part of keeping an all-volunteer military ready, and Joel Hefley was a leader in this revolutionary program. I was and am grateful for the opportunity afforded to me to partner with him in accomplishing passage and implementation of this key legislation enhancing the quality of life of our fighting men and women.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize November's celebration of National Epilepsy Awareness Month.Almost 3 million Americans have epilepsy, a neurological condition that makes people susceptible to seizures. Ten percent of Americans will experience a seizure in their lifetime, and each year, more than 181,000 develop seizures and epilepsy for the first time. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, races, and ethnic backgrounds. The condition can develop at any age, but epilepsy most often occurs in early childhood and old age.It is also important to note that ten percent of all injuries to U.S. soldiers in Iraq are head injuries. Severe head injuries like those incurred during battle and roadside bombings carry a high risk of seizures and epilepsy that, in many cases, can develop months after the initial trauma.Although advances in medical treatment have allowed some individuals with epilepsy to control their illness, more than 40 percent still have persistent seizures, despite all available treatments today. Epilepsy remains a formidable barrier to normal life, affecting educational opportunities, employment, and personal fulfillment.Furthermore, epilepsy continues to be poorly understood by many Americans. Individuals with epilepsy are often misdiagnosed, cannot access the specialists they need, or are the subject of discrimination and prejudice. This cannot continue.National Epilepsy Awareness Month aims to dispel common myths about individuals with epilepsy, increase public awareness and understanding about this serious condition, improve education to ensure faster diagnosis and treatment, and inform people about the services and informational resources available nationwide.Many years ago, my life was turned upside down. Something was wrong with me but my doctor could not identify the cause. Finally, I was diagnosed with epilepsy. This diagnosis brought many challenges, but in my current position as a legislator, it has also brought opportunity. I hope I can be of some influence in directing attention and research to a disorder that has been ignored and misunderstood for too long.Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of Congress to join all Americans with epilepsy, their families, friends, and supporters to do all we can to improve the lives of individuals with epilepsy.",

We have no opportunity, even though we pleaded with the Rules Committee to give us an opportunity to be able to speak on alternatives to this resolution.You have heard that this resolution is in support of the troops. It is not. You have heard that this resolution is in support of the war on terrorism. It is not. And I will tell you why it is not, and I will tell you why we have to have an alternative and why we need to vote ``no'' on this resolution, because it doesn't support the troops, and it does not support the war on terrorism.The people in this resolution that are referred to, the honored sacrifice that has been made by the Armed Forces of the United States, is supposedly on behalf of somebody called Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, a man who today said he was going to engage in conversations with terrorists who have murdered Americans to give them amnesty. This is the amnesty resolution.To vote for this resolution is to vote for those who support amnesty for those who kill American troops. This is the government we are supposed to be standing up and defending, the very freedom that gives that prime minister the possibility of speaking to the terrorists has been won by the blood and sacrifice of American troops. This is the amnesty bill. This is the amnesty resolution.There are people on this floor who will not grant amnesty to people who cut their lawns, who wash the dishes in the restaurants they eat in; but they are willing to vote for a resolution that says that they support a government that is willing to give amnesty to people who murder the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States.I am not going to do that. And if you disagree with that interpretation, give me the right to put it on the floor for a vote and let's see who wins the hearts and minds of the American people, not the Iraqi people, as to who is really supporting the troops and who is really willing to fight a war on terror.This is nothing but a resolution confirming the existing administration policies. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, you deserve the opportunity on the floor of the people's House to have a real debate, not a discussion, not to echo sentiments, but to have substantive words on the floor that allow the American people to understand what direction do we want to take this country.",

And as with many other things in our lives, sometimes your virtues are also your vices, so I understand that very, very well.My request is that you think perhaps about withdrawing this amendment. It is not to argue with you about your premises. Believe me, Mr. Flake, I don't do that. I understand exactly what you are saying, and I understand your concerns with regard to whether or not there are full and complete understandings of what we are doing and why we are doing it under the general aegis of earmarks. My point is that this particular designation has had thorough, and I assure you nonpartisan, thorough, complete briefings and hearings. That is the way our subcommittee works on Armed Services. I assure you of that.Again, as I say, everybody's virtue is also their vice; but let me tell you, if it is a vice to go into exquisite detail as to what you are dealing with, then Mr. Weldon, and I guess by extension myself, is guilty of that.I can assure you that if there is an argument on the floor against what we want to do with rotorcraft innovation in research, then I could understand why you wouldn't want to vote for it. But I can assure every Member here, Republican and Democrat alike, that in the Armed Services Subcommittee, on which I am privileged to serve with Mr. Weldon, that we go into the details of what we are doing and why we are doing it.The final point here. The reason that I support this and the reason Mr. Weldon recommended it to the subcommittee and that he succeeded is that the big companies, the big companies don't do the innovation and the research. They really don't.Mr. Hunter in particular, and, again, I have had my differences with Mr. Hunter, but Mr. Young recognizes and Mr. Hunter recognizes that true innovation in this country comes from the small companies. It comes from the research areas that don't necessarily get the big contracts, nor are they sought out by the big companies. They are like the Titanic. They go right down there. And they can be told there's an iceberg, but, boy, they head there anyway by kinetic energy.I can assure you, Mr. Flake, if you would at least consider withdrawing the amendment, this is one time when the research has been done, the background has been done, the hearings have been held, and we are trying to support the true innovative research side with regard to rotorcraft that might not otherwise get the attention that it deserves and what we need to have for our Armed Forces.I can assure you that the ideological content or premise that forms the philosophy upon which you are making these inquiries I have no argument with, and I give you credit for standing up. It is not easy to stand up against the tide coming at you. It is a lot easier to vote against you and walk off and claim victory. I don't do that. I don't take any shots like that at you. I respect you and I understand what you are doing and why you are doing it. But in this instance, my request to you as a ranking member on this subcommittee is that you consider whether or not this might be an instance in which the House is well served and the Nation is well served by its adoption as recommended by the Appropriations Committee.I thank you for your kind attention.",

I would rather talk about what the bill does do, rather than what its inadequacies might be.I got started in this bill because of my response to the arguments made by Mr. Peterson in committee. We pay attention in committee. Committee hearings and briefings are what gives us the opportunity to educate ourselves, and that is where I came to the table.I didn't know enough about this issue, and I learned about it. What I discovered was, particularly where natural gas was concerned, that we needed to have it. Natural gas is the alternative energy available to us now. It is the bridge to the alternative energy future that we want.None of us are opposing any of the alternatives that have been put forward today. We are saying we have to get there. In order to do that, we have to recognize that lifting the moratorium on the Outer Continental Shelf is the way to do it. It can be done safely. It can be done responsibly.Issues have been made about revenue. You can't get any revenue when you don't have it coming in; 100 percent of nothing is nothing. Arguing about where the revenue is going to go, whether it is the States in some formula, whether it comes back to the Federal Government, as the Congressional Budget Office now argues the bill does, is something that we can address in time to come when this bill leaves the House and goes to the Senate and hopefully comes back for a conference.No one is dismissing any of the legitimate concerns that have been made by those who are now in opposition to the bill. We can take all those issues up.We have labor support now. Construction trades are for the bill, because we are going to create jobs.When we talk about revenue, numbers have been tossed around and up to today as high as $600 billion. That money is leaving the United States. That money is not here for investment in jobs in the future of our country.If that is in fact what is at stake, if those billions of dollars are at stake, let us put it together in a manner that keeps jobs and that money in this country. Let's seek energy independence in this Nation. The time for natural gas exploration and extrication of energy resources in the Outer Continental Shelf has come. Simply to cite 25 years of saying no, no, no does not solve our problem.So I ask those who have some reservations about today's bill, move this bill forward. We will take up all the considerations that you have raised. Let's move to energy independence in this Nation. Let's move to a time when we can say that we met the responsibilities of our time.",

One hundred percent of nothing is nothing. There are no revenues coming in. All of these figures that are being bandied about as if we are losing something, we are not losing anything except energy independence in this country.Now we have reached out to everybody that we wanted to speak to and who has wanted to be honest with us about what we are talking about here today.We are losing jobs by the thousands. Why do you think that American labor is on our side in this? We are losing our petrochemical industries. We are losing our manufacturing base. We are losing our ability to farm, while rich, elite people in this country that support some of these environmental Taliban organizations are out there with the propaganda that is trying to say that some of us that are trying to get to energy independence are the ones that are causing the difficulty.Well, let me tell you something. We are not going to back off on this, and we are not going to listen to lies about revenue and distortions about revenue.

    "title": "THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT OF 2007",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce a bill which is a companion measure to legislation introduced by Senator Daniel Akaka in the Senate this morning. This measure is called the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007. The purpose of the bill is to provide a process for the reorganization of the Native Hawaiian governing entity for the purposes of a federally recognized government-to-government relationship.On this day 114 years ago, the monarchy of the Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown by agents of the United States. This injustice created wounds and issues that have never been healed or resolved. Fourteen years ago, the United States government took a step toward reconciling this part of history by passing a resolution which acknowledged the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and offered an apology to Native Hawaiians.The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act would take another step in the reconciliation process by providing Native Hawaiians the same right of self-governance and self-determination that are afforded to other indigenous peoples. Since Hawaii was annexed as a territory, the United States has treated Native Hawaiians in a manner similar to that of American Indians and Alaska Natives. This bill would formalize that relationship and establish parity in federal policies towards all of our indigenous peoples.This bill will also provide a structured process to address the longstanding issues resulting from the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. This discussion has been avoided for far too long because no one has known how to address or deal with the emotions that arise when these matters are discussed. There has been no structured process. Instead, there has been fear as to what the discussion would entail, causing people to avoid the issues. Such behavior has led to high levels of anger and frustration, as well as misunderstandings between Native Hawaiians and non-Native Hawaiians.The bill provides a structured process to negotiate and resolve these issues with the federal and state governments and will alleviate the growing mistrust, misunderstanding, anger, and frustration about these matters.This measure is supported by Hawaii's Governor, Linda Lingle, Hawaii's Congressional delegation, and the Hawaii State Legislature. The bill is also supported by a number of organizations in Hawaii who have passed resolutions in support of enacting this bill.I ask my colleagues to support this measure and advance the reconciliation process for our people.",

    "title": "INTRODUCING THE HAWAIIAN HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2007",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise in support of legislation I am proud to introduce today. The Hawaiian Homeownership Opportunity Act of 2007 is the exact same language of H.R. 5851, reported out of the House Financial Services Committee on September 28, 2006, in the 109th Congress.The measure reauthorizes existing Native Hawaiian housing programs for 5 years and makes two adjustments to the program that will allow the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands to help more Native Hawaiians whose incomes are equal to or less than 80 percent of the median income.In 2000 Congress passed legislation authorizing the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, to provide block grants for affordable housing for Native Hawaiians through the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. The 2000 measure also authorized HUD home loan guarantees for low-income Native Hawaiians. Eligible borrowers include Native Hawaiian families, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, and private nonprofit organizations experienced in planning and developing affordable housing for Native Hawaiians.The Hawaiian Home Ownership Opportunity Act of 2007 reauthorizes these programs and adds a new provision authorizing loan guarantees for home mortgage refinancing. This introduces greater flexibility and allows families to take advantage of lower interest rates as millions of other American families have. The measure would also permit the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands to issue bonds. This will allow the Department to service more low-income families without a large increase in appropriations.This bill is about homeownership; this is not welfare or public assistance. It offers another tool for a family to provide for a basic need, housing. This is unbelieveably important in Hawaii where land is scarce and the median home price on the island of Oahu is $639,000 and the median condominium price is $310,000. This measure will advance our efforts to address housing affordability in the islands.I would like to thank the House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank and Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity Chairwoman Maxine Waters who have been extremely supportive in dealing with the housing problems of Hawaii. I would also like to recognize my colleague from Hawaii, Congresswoman Mazie Hirono, who, like Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Waters, is a cosponsor of this legislation.I urge my colleagues to help the residents of Hawaii and support this legislation.",

    "title": "FORGETTING THE LESSONS OF HISTORY",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, the following 1984 speech by former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger provides an important perspective on the use of military force in Iraq.Thank you for inviting me to be here today with the members of the National Press Club, a group most important to our national security. I say that because a major point I intend to make in my remarks today is that the single most critical element of a successful democracy is a strong consensus of support and agreement for our basic purposes. Policies formed without a clear understanding of what we hope to achieve will never work. And you help to build that understanding among our citizens. Of all the many policies our citizens deserve and need to understand, none is so important as those related to our topic today the uses of military power. Deterrence will work only if the Soviets understand our firm commitment to keeping the peace, . . . and only from a well-informed public can we expect to have that national will and commitment. So today, I want to discuss with you perhaps the most important question concerning keeping the peace. Under what circumstances, and by what means, does a great democracy such as ours reach the painful decision that the use of military force is necessary to protect our interests or to carry out our national policy? National power has many components, some tangible, like economic wealth, technical pre-eminence. Other components are intangible such as moral force, or strong national will. Military forces, when they are strong and ready and modern, are a credible and tangible addition to a nation's power. When both the intangible national will and those forces are forged into one instrument, national power becomes effective. In today's world, the line between peace and war is less clearly drawn than at any time in our history. When George Washington, in his farewell address, warned us, as a new democracy, to avoid foreign entanglements, Europe then lay 2- 3 months by sea over the horizon. The United States was protected by the width of the oceans. Now in this nuclear age, we measure time in minutes rather than months. Aware of the consequences of any misstep, yet convinced of the precious worth of the freedom we enjoy, we seek to avoid conflict, while maintaining strong defenses. Our policy has always been to work hard for peace, but to be prepared if war comes. Yet, so blurred have the lines become between open conflict and half-hidden hostile acts that we cannot confidently predict where, or when, or how, or from what direction aggression may arrive. We must be prepared, at any moment, to meet threats ranging in intensity from isolated terrorist acts, to guerrilla action, to full-scale military confrontation. Alexander Hamilton, writing in the Federalist Papers, said that it is impossible to foresee or define the extent and variety of national exigencies, or the correspondent extent and variety of the means, which may be necessary to satisfy them. If it was true then, how much more true it is today, when we must remain ready to consider the means to meet such serious indirect challenges to the peace as proxy wars and individual terrorist action. And how much more important is it now, considering the consequences of failing to deter conflict at the lowest level possible. While the use of military force to defend territory has never been questioned when a democracy has been attacked and its very survival threatened, most democracies have rejected the unilateral aggressive use of force to invade, conquer or subjugate other nations. The extent to which the use of force is acceptable remains unresolved for the host of other situations which fall between these extremes of defensive and aggressive use of force. We find ourselves, then, face to face with a modern paradox: The most likely challenge to the peace--the gray area conflicts--are precisely the most difficult challenges to which a democracy must respond. Yet, while the source and nature of today's challenges are uncertain, our response must be clear and understandable. Unless we are certain that force is essential, we run the risk of inadequate national will to apply the resources needed. Because we face a spectrum of threats from covert aggression, terrorism, and subversion, to overt intimidation, to use of brute force, choosing the appropriate level of our response is difficult. Flexible response does not mean just any response is appropriate. But once a decision to employ some degree of force has been made, and the purpose clarified, our government must have the clear mandate to carry out, and continue to carry out, that decision until the purpose has been achieved. That, too, has been difficult to accomplish. The issue of which branch of government has authority to define that mandate and make decisions on using force is now being strongly contended. Beginning in the 1970s Congress demanded, and assumed, a far more active role in the making of foreign policy and in the decision-making process for the employment of military forces abroad than had been thought appropriate and practical before. As a result, the centrality of decision-making authority in the Executive branch has been compromised by the Legislative branch to an extent that actively interferes with that process. At the same time, there has not been a corresponding acceptance of responsibility by Congress for the outcome of decisions concerning the employment of military forces. Yet the outcome of decisions on whether and when and to what degree to use combat forces abroad has never been more important than it is today. While we do not seek to deter or settle all the world's conflicts, we must recognize that, as a major power, our responsibilities and interests are now of such scope that there are few troubled areas we can afford to ignore. So we must be prepared to deal with a range of possibilities, a spectrum of crises, from local insurgency to global conflict. We prefer, of course, to limit any conflict in its early stages, to contain and control it but to do that our military forces must be deployed in a timely manner, and be fully supported and prepared before they are engaged, because many of those difficult decisions must be made extremely quickly. Some on the national scene think they can always avoid making tough decisions. Some reject entirely the question of whether any force can ever be used abroad. They want to avoid grappling with a complex issue because, despite clever rhetoric disguising their purpose, these people are in fact advocating a return to post-World War I isolationism. While they may maintain in principle that military force has a role in foreign policy, they are never willing to name the circumstance or the place where it would apply. On the other side, some theorists argue that military force can be brought to bear in any crisis. Some of these proponents of force are eager to advocate its use even in limited amounts simply because they believe that if there are American forces of any size present they will somehow solve the problem. Neither of these two extremes offers us any lasting or satisfactory solutions. The first undue reserve would lead us ultimately to withdraw from international events that require free nations to defend their interests from the aggressive use of force. We would be abdicating our responsibilities as the leader of the free world responsibilities more or less thrust upon us in the aftermath of World War II war incidentally that isolationism did nothing to deter. These are responsibilities we must fulfill unless we desire the Soviet Union to keep expanding its influence unchecked throughout the world. In an international system based on mutual interdependence among nations, and alliances between friends, stark isolationism quickly would lead to a far more dangerous situation for the United States: we would be without allies and faced by many hostile or indifferent nations. The second alternative employing our forces almost indiscriminately and as a regular and customary part of our diplomatic efforts would surely plunge us headlong into the sort of domestic turmoil we experienced during the Vietnam war, without accomplishing the goal for which we committed our forces. Such policies might very well tear at the fabric of our society, endangering the single most critical element of a successful democracy: a strong consensus of support and agreement for our basic purposes. Policies formed without a clear understanding of what we hope to achieve would also earn us the scorn of our troops, who would have an understandable opposition to being used in every sense of the word casually and without intent to support them fully. Ultimately this course would reduce their morale and their effectiveness for engagements we must win. And if the military were to distrust its civilian leadership, recruitment would fall off and I fear an end to the all- volunteer system would be upon us, requiring a return to a draft, sowing the seeds of riot and discontent that so wracked the country in the '60s. We have now restored high morale and pride in the uniform throughout the services. The all-volunteer system is working spectacularly well. Are we willing to forfeit what we have fought so hard to regain? In maintaining our progress in strengthening America's military deterrent, we face difficult challenges. For we have entered an era where the dividing lines between peace and war are less clearly drawn, the identity of the foe is much less clear. In World Wars I and II, we not only knew who our enemies were, but we shared a clear sense of why the principles espoused by our enemies were unworthy. Since these two wars threatened our very survival as a free nation and the survival of our allies, they were total wars, involving every aspect of our society. All our means of production, all our resources were devoted to winning. Our policies had the unqualified support of the great majority of our people. Indeed, World Wars I and II ended with the unconditional surrender of our enemies. . . . The only acceptable ending when the alternative was the loss of our freedom. But in the aftermath of the Second World War, we encountered a more subtle form of warfare warfare in which, more often than not, the face of the enemy was masked. Territorial expansionism could be carried out indirectly by proxy powers, using surrogate forces aided and advised from afar. Some conflicts occurred under the name of ``national liberation,'' but far more frequently ideology or religion provided the spark to the tinder. Our adversaries can also take advantage of our open society, and our freedom of speech and opinion to use alarming rhetoric and disinformation to divide and disrupt our unity of purpose. While they would never dare to allow such freedoms to their own people, they are quick to exploit ours by conducting simultaneous military and propaganda campaigns to achieve their ends. They realize that if they can divide our national will at home, it will not be necessary to defeat our forces abroad. So by presenting issues in bellicose terms, they aim to intimidate western leaders and citizens, encouraging us to adopt conciliatory positions to their advantage. Meanwhile they remain sheltered from the force of public opinion in their countries, because public opinion there is simply prohibited and does not exist. Our freedom presents both a challenge and an opportunity. It is true that until democratic nations have the support of the people, they are inevitably at a disadvantage in a conflict. But when they do have that support they cannot be defeated. For democracies have the power to send a compelling message to friend and foe alike by the vote of their citizens. And the American people have sent such a signal by re-electing a strong Chief Executive. They know that President Reagan is willing to accept the responsibility for his actions and is able to lead us through these complex times by insisting that we regain both our military and our economic strength. In today's world where minutes count, such decisive leadership is more important than ever before. Regardless of whether conflicts are limited, or threats are ill defined, we must be capable of quickly determining that the threats and conflicts either do or do not affect the vital interests of the United States and our allies. . . . And then responding appropriately. Those threats may not entail an immediate, direct attack on our territory, and our response may not necessarily require the immediate or direct defense of our homeland. But when our vital national interests and those of our allies are at stake, we cannot ignore our safety, or forsake our allies. At the same time, recent history has proven that we cannot assume unilaterally the role of the world's defender. We have learned that there are limits to how much of our spirit and blood and treasure we can afford to forfeit in meeting our responsibility to keep peace and freedom. So while we may and should offer substantial amounts of economic and military assistance to our allies in their time of need, and help them maintain forces to deter attacks against them usually we cannot substitute our troops or our will for theirs. We should only engage our troops if we must do so as a matter of our own vital national interest. We cannot assume for other sovereign nations the responsibility to defend their territory without their strong invitation when our freedom is not threatened. On the other hand, there have been recent cases where the United States has seen the need to join forces with other nations to try to preserve the peace by helping with negotiations, and by separating warring parties, and thus enabling those warring nations to withdraw from hostilities safely. In the Middle East, which has been torn by conflict for millennia, we have sent our troops in recent years both to the Sinai and to Lebanon, for just such a peacekeeping mission. But we did not configure or equip those forces for combat they were armed only for their self-defense. Their mission required them to be and to be recognized as peacekeepers. We knew that if conditions deteriorated so they were in danger, or if because of the actions of the warring nations, their peacekeeping mission could not be realized, then it would be necessary either to add sufficiently to the number and arms of our troops in short to equip them for combat, . . . or to withdraw them. And so in Lebanon, when we faced just such a choice, because the warring nations did not enter into withdrawal or peace agreements, the President properly withdrew forces equipped only for peacekeeping. In those cases where our national interests require us to commit combat force we must never let there be doubt of our resolution. When it is necessary for our troops to be committed to combat, we must commit them, in sufficient numbers and we must support them, as effectively and resolutely as our strength permits. When we commit our troops to combat we must do so with the sole object of winning. Once it is clear our troops are required, because our vital interests are at stake, then we must have the firm national resolve to commit every ounce of strength necessary to win the fight to achieve our objectives. In Grenada we did just that. Just as clearly, there are other situations where United States combat forces should not be used. I believe the postwar period has taught us several lessons, and from them I have developed six major tests to be applied when we are weighing the use of U.S. combat forces abroad. Let me now share them with you: First, the United States should not commit forces to combat overseas unless the particular engagement or occasion is deemed vital to our national interest or that of our allies. That emphatically does not mean that we should declare beforehand, as we did with Korea in 1950, that a particular area is outside our strategic perimeter. Second, if we decide it is necessary to put combat troops into a given situation, we should do so wholeheartedly, and with the clear intention of winning. If we are unwilling to commit the forces or resources necessary to achieve our objectives, we should not commit them at all. Of course if the particular situation requires only limited force to win our objectives, then we should not hesitate to commit forces sized accordingly. When Hitler broke treaties and remilitarized the Rhineland, small combat forces then could perhaps have prevented the holocaust of World War II. Third, if we do decide to commit forces to combat overseas, we should have clearly defined political and military objectives. And we should know precisely how our forces can accomplish those clearly defined objectives. And we should have and send the forces needed to do just that. As Clausewitz wrote, ``no one starts a war or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war, and how he intends to conduct it.'' War may be different today than in Clausewitz's time, but the need for well-defined objectives and a consistent strategy is still essential. If we determine that a combat mission has become necessary for our vital national interests, then we must send forces capable to do the job and not assign a combat mission to a force configured for peacekeeping. Fourth, the relationship between our objectives and the forces we have committed their size, composition and disposition must be continually reassessed and adjusted if necessary. Conditions and objectives invariably change during the course of a conflict. When they do change, then so must our combat requirements. We must continuously keep as a beacon light before us the basic questions: ``Is this conflict in our national interest?'' ``Does our national interest require us to fight, to use force of arms?'' If the answers are ``yes,'' then we must win. If the answers are ``no,'' then we should not be in combat. Fifth, before the U.S. commits combat forces abroad, there must be some reasonable assurance we will have the support of the American people and their elected representatives in Congress. This support cannot be achieved unless we are candid in making clear the threats we face; the support cannot be sustained without continuing and close consultation. We cannot fight a battle with the Congress at home while asking our troops to win a war overseas or, as in the case of Vietnam, in effect asking our troops not to win, but just to be there. Finally, the commitment of U.S. forces to combat should be a last resort. I believe that these tests can be helpful in deciding whether or not we should commit our troops to combat in the months and years ahead. The point we must all keep uppermost in our minds is that if we ever decide to commit forces to combat, we must support those forces to the fullest extent of our national will for as long as it takes to win. So we must have in mind objectives that are clearly defined and understood and supported by the widest possible number of our citizens. And those objectives must be vital to our survival as a free nation and to the fulfillment of our responsibilities as a world power. We must also be farsighted enough to sense when immediate and strong reactions to apparently small events can prevent lion-like responses that may be required later. We must never forget those isolationists in Europe who shrugged that ``Danzig is not worth a war,'' and ``why should we fight to keep the Rhineland demilitarized?'' These tests I have just mentioned have been phrased negatively for a purpose they are intended to sound a note of caution that we must observe prior to committing forces to combat overseas. When we ask our military forces to risk their very lives in such situations, a note of caution is not only prudent, it is morally required. In many situations we may apply these tests and conclude that a combatant role is not appropriate. Yet no one should interpret what I am saying here today as an abdication of America's responsibilities either to its own citizens or to its allies. Nor should these remarks be misread as a signal that this country, or this Administration, is unwilling to commit forces to combat overseas. We have demonstrated in the past that, when our vital interests or those of our allies are threatened, we are ready to use force, and use it decisively, to protect those interests. Let no one entertain any illusions if our vital interests are involved, we are prepared to fight. And we are resolved that if we must fight, we must win. So, while these tests are drawn from lessons we have learned from the past, they also can and should be applied to the future. For example, the problems confronting us in Central America today are difficult. The possibility of more extensive Soviet and Soviet-proxy penetration into this hemisphere in months ahead is something we should recognize. If this happens we will clearly need more economic and military assistance and training to help those who want democracy. The President will not allow our military forces to creep or be drawn gradually into a combat role in Central America or any other place in the world. And indeed our policy is designed to prevent the need for direct American involvement. This means we will need sustained Congressional support to back and give confidence to our friends in the region. I believe that the tests I have enunciated here today can, if applied carefully, avoid the danger of this gradualist incremental approach, which almost always means the use of insufficient force. These tests can help us to avoid being drawn inexorably into an endless morass, where it is not vital to our national interest to fight. But policies and principles such as these require decisive leadership in both the Executive and Legislative branches of government and they also require strong and sustained public support. Most of all, these policies require national unity of purpose. I believe the United States now possesses the policies and leadership to gain that public support and unity. And I believe that the future will show we have the strength of character to protect peace with freedom. In summary, we should all remember these are the policies indeed the only policies that can preserve for ourselves, our friends, and our posterity, peace with freedom. I believe we can continue to deter the Soviet Union and other potential adversaries from pursuing their designs around the world. We can enable our friends in Central America to defeat aggression and gain the breathing room to nurture democratic reforms. We can meet the challenge posed by the unfolding complexity of the 1980s. We will then be poised to begin the last decade of this century amid a peace tempered by realism, and secured by firmness and strength. And it will be a peace that will enable all of us ourselves at home, and our friends abroad to achieve a quality of life, both spiritually and materially, far higher than man has even dared to dream.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am hoping that some of the misconceptions or misperceptions that might be out there can be alleviated, because I don't believe that this should be considered a controversial bill in any way. There are some issues with respect to questions about favoritism or reverse discrimination, et cetera. Some of these issues have been raised in other contexts.But in this particular instance, simply because the word or the phrase Native Hawaiian is attached, I hope that it doesn't confuse the issue. I have just had the opportunity to speak with Mr. Boehner, and I believe that we have an understanding about what is at stake here.Let me make very, very clear what we are talking about. It reauthorizes a Native Hawaiian housing block grant through 2012. Now, these funds are used for infrastructure development and homeownership assistance under a program that is administered by the State of Hawaii as the result of Federal legislation in the last century. The bill that is on the floor today did not originate with Representative Hirono or myself, but is as a result of the request of the Hawaiian Homes Commission and its chairman, under the leadership of Governor Lingle, Governor Linda Lingle, who is a Republican.The reason I bring that up is not to cite that for special consideration, but rather that this is not a Democrat and Republican issue. This is an institutional issue that whoever is Governor, and whoever are the commissioners, in this instance happen to be Republican, appointed by a Republican Governor. Those folks are obligated institutionally to bring these issues to the Congress for final adjudication because of the unique status, the unique legal status of the Hawaiian Home Lands.The Hawaiian Home Lands were created by the Congress as a result of legislation put forward by the original delegate from the Hawaiian Islands to the Congress, Prince Kuhio, Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalaniana'ole, for whom the Federal building is named where I have my offices in Honolulu, the PJKK. Mr. Renzi may refer to the PJKK Federal Building. He was a Republican at the time, and as a result of his presentation, the original Hawaiian Home Lands were created.It enables Hawaiian families on Hawaiian Home Lands under this unique legal status to be able to acquire private financing they otherwise can't get because they are under this legal admonition to go through the Hawaiian Homes Commission. So it allows the Hawaiian Home Lands, the Department, to be eligible for loan guarantees to borrow, issue bonded debt, enabling servicing up to five times their annual allocation.This allows the Department to service low-income families without a large increase in Federal appropriations. That's the whole idea of it. It allows low-income Hawaiians to get their refinancing in addition to construction. It reduces the cost of homeownership, and it reduced risk by lowering monthly mortgage payments. That is what this is about. It's no special consideration. It is fulfilling the law as it exists.",

And also, I want to reiterate my thanks to Mr. Boehner for his open-mindedness and his attitude of being willing to listen on issues that might otherwise have been easily misunderstood. I am grateful also to Mr. Cole of Oklahoma for his participation and for his leadership in again helping us to discern issues that are of distinct advantage, not just to our particular constituents in Hawaii, but on the whole issue of how we are able to help people achieve homeownership, achieve an opportunity not to be dependent on government, but rather to be able to participate in the American Dream, the overall American Dream in a way that has genuine meaning for them and their families.I am very pleased to see that this has not become a partisan issue, and that it has not ended up dividing us when we should, in fact, be united in our opportunity to minimize the effect of government having bad consequences for people, and maximizing the opportunity for the ordinary individual and the ordinary individual's family to be able to advance the family's cause.In this particular instance then, Mr. Speaker, I am very, very pleased that we are able to move forward on this, and I hope that the vote will be a solid one and that we can move forward to other issues not only where homeownership is concerned, but advancing the capacity of families to be able to succeed in the American Dream.I would like to express my gratitude to the gentlelady from California, and express my thanks to her for the leadership of her and her committee in bringing this forward. Again, Mr. Speaker, before I close, my deep respect for and gratitude to Mr. Renzi and for all those who helped bring this forward on the Republican side of the aisle.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I will just recapitulate for a couple of moments, then perhaps we can move to the conclusion.I indicated last night, and I think it was agreed to by Mr. Bachus of Alabama and others, by way of material that has been entered into the Record, like Mr. Renzi of Arizona, that this should not be a partisan fight. In fact, ``fight'' probably is the wrong word, but, I mean, even a disagreement here.The reason that this bill passed overwhelmingly last week, with significant support from the Republican side of the aisle, was that it was supported in committee by Republicans and Democrats. The bill is here before the Congress as a result of a request by Hawaii's Republican Governor, and the former Chair of the Hawaii Republican Party, who is now the head of the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.We have always had legislation in this area based on the underlying law, which was passed in 1921, by the Congress, setting aside certain lands for Hawaiians. The issue before us is about refinancing of home mortgages. This is not about whether the original law, under which the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands was established, it is constitutional.On the contrary, that issue has been raised, and it perhaps should be raised in another context; namely, if someone wants to change the underlying law. But we should not punish my constituents or anybody's constituents for the fact that they appear before us in the form of a bill trying to carry forward on the admonitions required of them, in this instance, by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in order to get their mortgages refinanced.Let me say, just as recently as February 9 of this year, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against a group of individuals who came before the court, saying that funding for programs that benefit Hawaiians, in this instance, of this bill, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, constitutes an unconstitutional discrimination against non-Hawaiians.The Federal appeals court ruled that was not the case. In fact, they returned it to the U.S. District Court to see if the plaintiffs were eligible ``in any other capacity.'' That is to say, other than whether it was constitutional.So we have, as recently as the last 30 days, appeals court admonitions that the constitutionality of having programs for Hawaiians is, in fact, constitutional.If someone wants to argue that, please let's argue it on the basis of a bill that addresses that itself, rather than the bill which is before us, which has to do with the refinancing of mortgages. Please don't punish people that are trying to own their own homes, to keep their own homes, because of some ideological difference that we might have.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the final passage of H.R. 835, the Hawaiian Homeownership Opportunity Act of Opponents of this bill believe this program may be unconstitutional based upon a mistaken interpretation of Rice v. Cayetano. But Rice v. Cayetano was a voting rights case. The question put to the Court was whether limiting the right to vote for trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to Native Hawaiians violated the 15th amendment. The court in Rice specifically declined to rule on the status of Native Hawaiians and Native Hawaiian programs created by Congress.Moreover, this bill and these programs have never been a partisan issue in the past. This reauthorization and improvements were requested by Hawaii's Republican administration and Governor Linda Lingle. The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands is chaired by the former head of Hawaii's State Republican Party. This bill was introduced last year by Congressman Bob Ney and was reported out of the Financial Services Committee by voice vote and without amendment. Last Congress's Republican chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mike Oxley, cosponsored this bill.I mention these pieces of background information to illustrate the wide support for the program and the fact that it has been both Democratic and Republican. Last week, when this bill was up for consideration in the House under a suspension of the rules, the GOP leadership issued a statement just hours before the vote, calling the bill ``unconstitutional'' and charged that it would ``confer on Native Hawaiian an arrangement like that between the federal government and American Indian tribes.'' Despite these charges, the bill was able to garner 34 Republican votes.The status of Native Hawaiians needs to be debated and should be debated in the House. However, this is the wrong venue for that. I have another bill pending in the House of Representatives that would establish a process for the Federal recognition of Native Hawaiians. I hope to have this legislation considered by the House Natural Resources Committee and will gladly debate these issues at that time.This measure is about helping low-income Native Hawaiians own their own home. The programs reauthorized by H.R. 835 simply provide funds for infrastructure, helps Native Hawaiians obtain mortgages and allows for refinancing to lower the cost of homeownership. This bill is about assisting Native Hawaiians to reach the American dream of owning their own home.I believe this bill can, and should, pass with overwhelming bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to vote for final passage of this bill and support efforts to get more low-income people into their own homes.",

    "title": "CELEBRATING ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Asian Pacific American (APA) Heritage Month. As you know May is designated as APA Heritage Month, and this year's theme is ``Meeting the Challenges for Asian Pacific Americans.'' One of the central challenges is the need for comprehensive immigration reform.I serve as the Immigration Task Force Chairman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC). The caucus includes members who are of Asian Pacific descent and those who represent Congressional Districts with significant APA populations, like the First District of Hawaii.The Immigration Task Force is CAPAC's main voice on this important and timely issue. Right now, APAs face an immigration backlog that has forced many families to live for years apart from their loved ones. For example, Filipinos must wait 23 years before United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) even examines their applications for a brother or sister from the Philippines. Furthermore, 1.5 million Asians live in the U.S. as undocumented immigrants. They live in the shadows without access to basic services, and are vulnerable to exploitation.As Task Force Chairman, I have made it a priority for CAPAC to support Comprehensive Immigration Reform. True immigration reform not only helps us secure our borders, but addresses the issues of family reunification and earned legalization for undocumented immigrants. With that concern, I cosponsored H.R. 1645, the ``Security Through Regularized Immigration and a Vibrant Economy (STRIVE) Act of 2007,'' and I am working now to get members of CAPAC to support this bill.The ``STRIVE Act'' would help eliminate the family backlog by no longer counting spouses and minor children of naturalized citizens against the worldwide cap on family-based immigration. That means remaining visas can reduce the backlog for the other classes of family-based immigrants. Such a move not only serves as a humane gesture, but upholds our core family values.The ``STRIVE Act'' also addresses the concerns of the undocumented immigrants, providing for earned legalization, which means that people would be allowed to emerge from the shadows. Illegal immigrants would have to pay fines and back taxes, pass criminal background checks, and meet English and civics learning requirements. Contrary to the rhetoric, these immigrants would not jump ahead of those who have pending legal visa applications, but would instead have to wait their turn. Furthermore, they would not count against either the family-based or employment-based immigration caps.While not perfect, the ``STRIVE Act'' is an excellent start to solving the immigration reform problem. As we celebrate the contributions of APAs to the nation, we must rededicate ourselves to a new direction; to meet the challenges faced by APA families. That is how we open the door to the American dream to all Americans.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H. Res. 355, a resolution recognizing and welcoming the leaders of the Pacific Islands to Washington, D.C., and commending the East-West Center for hosting the Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders.The United States has always had a unique relationship to the Pacific Islands. Not only do they help play a key role in the fight against terrorism, but these governments also aid the U.S. in its overall security. Furthermore, both the U.S. and the Pacific Islands rely on the vast resources of the Pacific basin; these resources while enormous are not unlimited, and management requires cooperation across all of our governments. These islands also work closely with the U.S. on an important environmental and security concern, global climate change, which has the potential to drastically affect all who depend on the Pacific for their livelihood. Furthermore, trade, tourism, and other economic ties further reveal the interdependence between the Pacific Islands and the U.S. The resolution before us recognizes these factors.As we mark Asian Pacific American (APA) Heritage month, we would also be remiss to not point out that Americans of Pacific Island decent are a rapidly growing ethnic group within the U.S. They add strength to our communities with their diversity and values, and they make important contributions to the U.S. as a whole. The resolution also mentions this important fact.Furthermore, the resolution discusses the importance of the East-West Center, which runs the Conference of Leaders. Congress established the East-West Center, which is based in my district, in 1960. The East-West Center seeks to establish a dialogue between the peoples and nations of Asia, the Pacific, and the U.S. The East-West Center provides a home for academics who perform vital research that helps all parties better understand each other's history and culture. The Center's Education and Outreach sphere helps disseminate what researchers learn to the broader public and to policymakers. Finally, the Center provides important dialogue programs. Under the effective leadership of Dr. Charles Morrison, the East-West Center continues to address the challenges of the Asian-Pacific 21st Century.Established in 1980 the East-West Center's Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders grows out of these dialogue programs. It seeks to bring together leaders from the region to discuss many of the issues I mentioned earlier. In the era of growing interdependence between the U.S. and Pacific Island governments, both the work of the Center and the Conference of Leaders becomes more important.I urge my colleagues to support both this resolution, and provide continued support to the East-West Center.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support legislation that has been introduced by my colleague, Congresswoman Bordallo. H.R. 1595, the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act, would honor the residents of Guam for their loyalty and compensate them for the atrocities they suffered during the Japanese occupation of Guam.During World War II, Guam was invaded, seized and occupied by Imperial Japanese forces for nearly three years. The war destroyed much of Guam, including housing, public buildings, utilities and infrastructure. In addition, the people of Guam suffered many deaths and an untold number of acts of brutality. This ruthless brutality has left a lasting impact on the survivors of the war and the descendants of victims.In 1947, the Secretary of the Navy commissioned a civilian committee on the Naval Administration of Guam and American Samoa to prepare a report with specific recommendations. The report became known as the Hopkins Report and was submitted to the Secretary of the Navy in 1947. Among other things, the report addressed deficiencies in the war claims process for Guam immediately after the war ended. In the cover letter submitted with the report, the committee stated, ``Only so can justice be done to a valiant group of Americans who at great cost to themselves remained steadfastly loyal during the war . . . in so special a case this government could well be very generous in method of distributing its relief as well as generous in amount awarded. It has been neither.''Many decades later, the 107th Congress authorized the Guam War Claims Review Commission to determine if the people of Guam received parity in claims as compared to other Americans who experienced losses and damages during the war. In 2004, the Commission submitted their final report to Congress and found that Guam's residents were inequitably treated.There has been legislation to address this inequitable treatment in every Congress since 1985. Two hearings have been held, one in the 108th Congress and one on in the 109th Congress. It is time to follow the recommendations made by both the Hopkins report and the Guam War Claims Review Commission by providing adequate reparations for the people of Guam. It is time to honor them for their sacrifices.Congresswoman Bordallo has done a fantastic job over the years to create the most fair and equitable legislation that Congress can pass. I hope the people of Guam know that this issue is being addressed and the people have not been forgotten.I urge my colleagues to support the people of Guam and vote for final passage.",

    "text": "Madam Chairman, let's go over what this does do and why it's here.This amendment places a 1-year ban on flag and general officers in the Armed Services from receiving compensation from any company that does greater than $50 million in business with the Department of Defense. The rationale is very, very straightforward. It assures that large corporations, relying on DOD business, do not take advantage of loopholes in the post-employment ethics laws right now. That's what this is addressing, what exists right now.Current laws govern conduct-based actions. Conduct-based actions and restrictions that are in there now are meaningless because there's what's called behind-the-scenes and in-house provisions. I didn't make this up. This is what's going on right now. If I'm going to get lectured on ethics, let's talk about ethics. Former flag and general officers cannot overtly attempt to influence government officials. We know that. The $50 million ensures that small businesses seeking access to the DOD market are protected and people can go to work for them.It does not impact officers pay grade O-6 and below. We are talking about the top people up here making the top money making the top decisions with Department of Defense organizations.The amendment protects senior officers from large DOD prime contractors seeking to gain undue influence during their time in service. You think you walk out the door of the Pentagon and down the stairs and by immaculate conception can go to work for one of these DOD corporations and not have tried to influence that job beforehand or negotiate that job before you walk out the door?Take public universities. From the publication that just came out in March of 2007, of all the universities in the country, only two universities in the country are doing more than $50 million worth of business. So that is open that you can go to.Dwight Eisenhower, more than 40 years ago, way back in 1961, warned us about the military industrial complex that was emerging in our country. And I am quoting: ``Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions.''I think President Eisenhower's words speak for themselves. The amendment speaks for itself. This is an implementation of an ethics rule that should apply to the Pentagon, and I would think that people of goodwill would want to embrace it.",

Moreover, this does not impact officers paygrade O-6 and below.Why include all flag and general officers? While not all flag and general officers are involved in procurement, they can be involved in the development of future military systems and operational requirements or have ``official responsibility'' for an acquisition program.This amendment will protect senior officers from large DoD prime contractors seeking to gain undue influence during their time in service. The ``prime'' contractors in the DoD industry are so pervasive and ingrained that they have been referred to as ``quasi-agencies'' in the media. One private company received over $24 billion in DoD contracts, an amount equal to the budget request for the Department of Justice for Fiscal Year 2008 budget request totals $24.02 billion.Another concern is the impact on the ability of these former officers to teach at universities. Well over 1,000 schools are listed in the Federal Science and Engineering Support to Universities, Colleges and Nonprofit Institutions: FY 2004 Report released March 2007--only two schools received more than $50 million in DoD funds (Johns Hopkins and University of Texas at Austin).I urge my colleagues to support closing loopholes in our ethics laws and vote in favor of this amendment.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 406, celebrating the accomplishments of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, also known as the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act, and recognizing the need to continue pursuing the goal of educational opportunities for women and girls.Title IX changed the way the United States educates its women and girls. It states that, ``No person in the United States, shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.'' This monumental legislation has had far-reaching effects on the women in this country. Title IX may be best known for its changes in athletics, but the academic world has been significantly changed as well. Since 1981, women have received more bachelor's degrees than men, and since 1986, women have received more master's degrees than men. None of this would have been possible without the hard work of Patsy Mink and Edith Green. Generations of women have and will benefit from the work of these women.I had the honor of serving with Patsy Mink for 12 years, representing the State of Hawaii in the U.S. House of Representatives. She strove to ensure equality and fairness for all Americans. Through her work on title IX, she was able to accomplish just that for every American woman. The renaming of title IX to the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act honors her work and reminds us all of her dedication to equality.We should take this time to reflect on where we have come from and the progress we have made. Millions of women have access to the education to make their dreams come true, and that access was guaranteed 35 years ago by a woman who believed that we should all be able to better our lives.",

I can assure you of that.I think I know something about tourism. I know that in order to have tourists, you have to have people with jobs that have sufficient discretionary income to be able to come and spend their money. But if we're destroying the industrial structure of this country, which is what we're about right now, there won't be anybody having the jobs to be able to come and spend the money on tourism or anything else.And if you want them to arrive in automobiles, which we can't do yet because I haven't been able to get an earmark for that bridge from San Francisco to Hawaii, that's a bridge to somewhere, I can assure you, the question then would be, well, what are you going to be paying for your gasoline? You want to have a hybrid car, you're going to have natural gas. You have to have natural gas as the base. You want to have ethanol to be able to do it? You have to have natural gas for the fertilizer that's going to grow the feedstocks in order to create the ethanol.Natural gas is the natural energy bridge to a natural energy future, to an alternative energy future. If we don't have natural gas, let me tell you what's going to happen. It's happening right now, and there has been references to it already. Europe and Russia are now making a deal to promote natural gas exploration and extrication from Russia to the European economy, to the European Union in the hundreds of billions of gallons in order to be able to compete with us. It's not just mythology that the Chinese, using inferior technology, will be some 45 miles off of Florida right now exploring natural gas, as the Canadians are already doing on the other side of the Great Lakes.Every single industrial country in this world is producing natural gas right now except us. We are the ones that destroying ourselves, committing suicide on this. This is what is happening; the rest of the world is going to have an industrial base and an industrial complex that's able to compete, and we're destroying ourselves.You're looking at a convert here. I went into the Resources Committee fully prepared to not only sustain the moratorium that's here, but to vote against Mr. Peterson when he first brought up the idea of drilling for natural gas. But when I listened to him and I read all the facts involved, I decided that I had the wrong position. And what's required of us now is to become energy independent. We have to produce the energy in this country that is going to allow us to be independent, sufficient to be able to back up that Defense Department that we're talking about. The Air Force right now is spending an enormous amount of money on fuel that we have to import. If we can take the natural gas base for the Air Force right now, we stand a chance of producing fuel that can sustain ourselves.We have to be energy independent in this country. And that means those of who us who have blindly supported, what were supposedly the right environmental proposals in the past have to take an honest look at where we are today and what we can do to produce clean energy.Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the time. I hope that when we get past this today, that we will deal with the bill that Mr. Peterson and I will be bringing forward to produce natural gas in this country to produce a free and independent America.",

The President of the United States, Republican or Democrat, including this President, has put these funds in the budget in order to meet the obligations of the contract.Again, Mr. Chairman, I am not familiar with how the gentleman from the Eighth District of Georgia handles contracts, but we honor them where I come from.There is 200,000 acres set aside, and the original legislation states as follows, section 1065-569, I commend to the gentleman's attention: ``Congress does not extend services to Native Hawaiians because of their race, but because of their unique status as the indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to whom the United States has established a trust relationship.''The Admissions Act that brought us into the Union as the 50th State says specifically that, with regard to these lands, the Hawaiian Homes Lands, that they are to be administered by the State of Hawaii and the United States ``for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians as defined under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920.'' And it goes on from there to cite what is involved.Now, the block grant program provides funds for infrastructure to help Native Hawaiians obtain mortgages on lands set aside for them from Congress. Because of the conditions set out by the Congress, ordinary financing is not available to them. This is why we have to do it. If the gentleman had had the courtesy to sit down for 2 minutes with us, we could have explained what this was about.A decision has to be made here. Of course we have to come and defend our programs. Everybody does. I am quite content to do that.But this is the first time ever in my experience, my legislative experience of more than 33 years, that this kind of thing has taken place.Now, I know you folks over there. I'm looking at friends of mine right here. You would never have, me or Ms. Hirono would never do this kind of thing to you. If you have a disagreement about it, come and see us. Let's sit down and talk about it. And if you still disagree with what we're doing and why we're doing it, by all means bring it to our attention on the floor. But these kinds of attacks are unworthy of this House. It's unworthy of us to have relationships with one another like this. I don't understand it. I've never experienced it before.Now, we can do this in 5-minute segments if we want to, but that's not the way to handle this. I appeal to you, if this is going to be a continuing onslaught, let's sit down and talk it over.This legislation, the Department of Hawaiian Homelands is one of the most effective housing efforts that we have in order to try and meet the conditions that were set forth by the Congress and administered faithfully by the State of Hawaii since our entrance to the Union in 1959.The House supported reauthorization of this program; 272 Members, including 45 Republicans, voted for it. It is not a partisan issue.And I'll finish with this, Mr. Chairman. The Republican Governor and the Republican Members of the House of Representatives and the Senate in Hawaii, as well as the Democrats, support this program. It is not a partisan issue.And so I ask, out of courtesy for Members, that if we're going to have a discussion about this, at least let's have it on the merits of what the issue is before us. And if we're going to do this kind of thing, at least have the courtesy, the common courtesy that should be extended to any Member of House, to let us know that it's happening so perhaps, Mr. Chairman, we could resolve the issue beforehand.The Acting CHAIRMAN.

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, once again I find myself on the floor wishing that I had an opportunity to perhaps discuss the issue that is raised in the amendment. I wish really honestly that the courtesies would be extended on this to one another, not just on this issue but on any issue where it affects individuals.Let me explain for a moment if I can to you and some others who may be listening in, Mr. Chairman. Here is a list of votes on Native issues. There are 52 Members, 52 Members who have tribes in their districts, some multiple. Some of them are Republican Members who are sponsors of this bill. Each of them has unique questions and problems that have to be dealt with. It goes to Republicans, it goes to Democratic districts.I find it distressing that this is becoming more and more a partisan issue for some folks in the Republican Conference. I can't comprehend it exactly.As I say, here is 52. Here are some of the votes that were taken, Minority-Serving Institutions, Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity Act, 59 votes against it all from Members of the Republican Conference.Motion to amend the Small Business Act to expand and improve assistance provided by small business development centers to Indian tribe members, Alaskan Natives and Native Hawaiians, 73 members of the Republican Conference. I am not quite sure why this is happening.I don't understand why Native issues and issues having to do with indigenous people and minorities find now an increasing number in the Republican Conference who are voting ``no'' on it. I wish we could get a dialogue established in some way to try and understand why Native people are being attacked.In this particular instance, Mr. Chairman, I bring to your attention and the Members' attention the Admission Act that brought Hawaii into the Union. The Admission Act requires that we address questions such as those in the present bill that is before us.Now if someone wants to attack the Admission Act, I suggest they go to court and do that. All we are doing here and all that is being requested in this bill that is before us is that which is required of us by law in order to accomplish the task at hand. If someone is opposed, and I invite once again the Members here who have this amendment, why attack us? Why attack our people for trying to implement the law? Attack the law. Change the law if that is what you want to do, if that is what you think is necessary.We have 200,000 acres set aside for the betterment of Native Hawaiians. That is what the law says we are supposed to do. That is what the Admission Act which brought us into the United States says is required of us.I can quote: Any such lands income, therefore, shall be held by the said State as a public trust for the support of the public schools and other public educational institutions and for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians for the development of farm and home ownership, as widespread a basis as possible, and for making public improvements and provisions of lands for public use.That is what the Admission Act says we are supposed to do, for the betterment of Native Hawaiians. That is what this is about. If one is opposed to that for everybody, for all of the tribes and so on, I guess we can take it up with the other Members and so on. I don't know. But I don't think here on the floor in any bill that is a consequence of trying to fulfill our obligations constitutionally is the way to go about it. Take it to court. Put in a bill to do that, but don't hurt us today.",

    "text": "Just a couple of notes. My good friend from Iowa was complimentary to me, and I am appreciative of that. I want to indicate to him, perhaps he misunderstood my intention in citing just a couple of instances where the vote was taken by himself and others with regard to minorities, with regard to Native Alaskans and tribal members and Native Hawaiians.The reason that I cited it was not because I was trying to look for something for them that they did not deserve or would not prove useful to them, but let me explain why I cited them, because I thought it was undermining the principles that were cited by our friend from Georgia and our friend from Iowa, initiative, working yourself up the economic and social ladder of success.Take the two bills. First, the Minority Serving Institutional Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity Act. If you go into the bill itself, what it is is to try to assist in the areas where minorities are at issue, with trying to increase their capacity to do business, to increase their abilities to deal with wireless technology, digital technology today, as the keystone to economic opportunity and economic success. It's to give people the opportunity to increase their ability to pay their taxes to participate in the American foundation of American economic opportunity so that they could actually increase their capacity to succeed economically.The same with the other bill, which is why I cited it. I thought that these were the kinds of things that we could all get behind, improve and expand the small business development centers. I know, out in Hawaii, for a fact the small business development centers have been crucial to getting small businesses under way to aiding and assist people who need not just a handout but a hand up, and to give them the technical skills not ordinarily available to them, to give them some of the institutional references that they need to make in order to be able to apply for loans to succeed in achieving, getting the loans to get started, particularly microloans and so on.I can't speak for you, but I am sure you, as well, are familiar with small business development centers. What we are trying to do here, in the area of Indian tribe members, Alaskan Natives and Native Hawaiians is to extend that helping hand so they can participate even further and achieve the very goals my good friend from Iowa and my good friend from Georgia have cited as being worthy of pursuit, not just by way of legislation, but by way of the everyday activities of constituents as they try to partake in the American Dream.That's all this is about. We want to give people the opportunity legislatively to take advantage of the small business development centers, to take advantage of the new wireless technology in a way that might not have been available to them otherwise.The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price).",

It requires us all to work together.Now, there are some, I am sorry to say, on both ends of the spectrum of the parties who want to diminish what the bill is all about and what its intent is all about. Someone went so far yesterday as to say, well, this bill is like naming post offices.Well, yesterday, we named two post offices for marines that were killed in Iraq. I don't suppose the author of that kind of commentary would like to speak with the family of the marines who have been killed about why these post offices were named.I think it's pretty important that we concentrate on those who are bearing the brunt of the policies that we approve of in this body. That's what this is all about. We want to end the party sniping. We want to end the commentary about advantages being taken from one party or another.Cover has been mentioned, about whether it would be given to one party or another. The only cover that we are interested in is the cover that has to be obtained by our fighting men and women in the field, because they are engaged in battle as a result of the policies that we either approve or disapprove of.It's time for the Congress to take back its responsibility.Madam Speaker, I would like to enter into the Record a commentary from the Government Accountability Office as of the end of July of this year.Issues that DOD needs to consider in planning and executing the draw down and redeployment of forces from Iraq:What issues will the Department of Defense consider in the planning and executing of the draw-down and redeployment of forces from Iraq? It includes the draw-down, scope, the costs, the timetable, the capacity issues, logistics issues. These are the serious and sober subjects of what will be presented to us by these redeployment plans.You cannot have a redeployment by wish fulfillment alone. You have to have the practical realities in front of you in order to accomplish it. That's what we are seeking to do. That's what the Armed Services Committee on a bipartisan basis sought to accomplish with this bill. This is serious and sober business.Section two of the measure states the strategy required ``shall include planning to achieve the following.'' That's what we mean by the status of the planning. Status of the planning will include the transition of combat forces from policing civil strife or sectarian violence in Iraq.It has to include a projection in the number of members the Armed Forces required for the missions described in the redeployment. The details of what these redeployment plans will encompass are included in the bill, and so the preamble that is there that says the original resolution has now been accomplished takes us to this final conclusion that we reach today, the redeployment of our troops in a responsible way and a bipartisan manner.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I submit for the Record a statement from Stuart W. Bowen, Jr., Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Forbes, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to address you today on the work of the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. To ensure accurate context, permit me to outline several points essential to understanding the challenges of investigating and prosecuting fraud in Iraq. First, corruption within the Iraqi government, indeed within the fabric of Iraqi society, is a serious problem that inhibits progress on many fronts in Iraq. This is widely recognized by the Government of Iraq and the international community. In our quarterly reports, SIGIR has called Iraq's endemic corruption problem a ``second insurgency.'' I returned last month from my 16th trip to Iraq and, during my visit, I met with the Commissioner of Public Integrity, who heads the institution created by the CPA to increase accountability for public corruption in Iraq--and the President of the Board of Supreme Audit, the analogue to the Government Accountability Office, which has existed in Iraq for many decades. The Iraqi anti-corruption authorities again emphasized to me the widespread nature of the problem of corruption, which stretches across the government, afflicting virtually every ministry. And they outlined for me the difficulties they face in implementing their respective anti- corruption mandates. The CPI Commissioner told me that he currently has 2,000 cases involving $5 billion in alleged corruption. And the President of the Board of Supreme Audit has hundreds of audits ongoing. In virtually every case, he is uncovering a lack of accountability. Let me emphasize that the CPI and the BSA oversee Iraqi money--not U.S. money--that is missing or has been stolen from Iraqi programs. During my visit, I was informed about political interference with the work of Iraqi investigators and prosecutors. For example, I learned that Ministers and former Ministers are exempt from prosecution unless the assent of the Prime Minister is obtained; and each Minister is entitled, under an Iraqi criminal code provision, to immunize selectively ministry employees from being held accountable for corruption. Iraq must make progress on rule of law enforcement, in general, and corruption, in particular; political interference with fighting corruption remains a problem, undermining the effectiveness of the developing rule of law system and consequently eroding the Iraqi people's confidence in their government. Iraq is a sovereign state. The role of the United States thus is to encourage the development of an efficient Iraqi justice system. We do this for its own sake and for the sake of maintaining and building upon the efforts made, at great cost in blood and treasure, by Americans and Iraqis since the liberation of Iraq. SIGIR's specific role in this process has been to review the effectiveness of United States efforts to improve the rule of law system and to build up the corruption-fighting capacity of the Iraqi government. On July 28, 2006, SIGIR released a survey on this subject and found that American efforts were funded at a very modest level, given the scope of the problem, receiving about $65 million (about three-tenths of 1 percent of our total reconstruction spending). My auditors found that American efforts have not been sufficiently coordinated and focused and that more adequate leadership and organization was needed. The U.S. Embassy has responded to some of these concerns since the review was released. SIGIR will soon release another review on the issue, updating our previous report. SIGIR has a continuing investigative responsibility to detect and investigate malfeasance in American relief and reconstruction programs in Iraq. As part of this effort, we have developed good working-level and leadership-level relationships with the CPI and the BSA. We coordinate with these Iraqi agencies whenever we come across evidence of potential wrongdoing by Iraqis. SIGIR, of course, concentrates its law enforcement efforts on American targets and works with the Department of Justice in their effective prosecution. My second point is that the incidence of corruption within the U.S. reconstruction program--judging from those cases that we have uncovered thus far--appears to constitute a relatively small component of the overall American financial contribution to Iraq's reconstruction. Based on the work of our 18 career investigators on SIGIR staff, I believe that losses to American taxpayers from fraud within reconstruction programs will likely amount to a relatively small component of the overall investment in Iraq, totaling in the tens of millions (rather than hundreds of millions or billions, as is sometimes imagined). However, the fact that the fraud we have detected is relatively small (to date) does not diminish the aggressiveness with which SIGIR pursues allegations of fraud in Iraq. We have found egregious incidents of fraud. And in partnership with the Department of Justice, SIGIR has produced clear results in prosecutions and convictions. For example, in January, two individuals were sentenced to prison as a result of SIGIR investigations. In early February, indictments were announced of five more individuals, resulting from SIGIR investigations. To date, SIGIR has opened over 300 cases, and we have over 70 ongoing investigations. Thirty-two of those cases are under prosecution at the Department of Justice. We believe that the publicity our enforcement actions have received has helped to deter misconduct in the U.S. reconstruction program. And we also believe that enforcement will be an increasingly important part of SIGIR's mission over the next 18 months. Moreover, in the course of this year, we expect to produce concrete investigative results as significant current cases come to fruition. SIGIR remains committed to a robust, deterrent presence in Iraq as long as our temporary organization exists. Today, I have five investigators on the ground in Iraq investigating fraud. Although there are other law enforcement agencies fighting fraud in Iraq, SIGIR has maintained over the past 3 years the largest contingent of fraud investigators in Iraq. My investigators travel the country under dangerous conditions, pursuing leads, interviewing witnesses, and piecing together evidence on a wide variety of cases. Their work also takes them to other countries in the region. Of note, SIGIR is currently reducing its overall personnel ``footprint'' in Baghdad in conjunction with the reduction in spending of appropriated dollars on Iraq reconstruction. One of the most important aspects of our investigative efforts is the development of task-force relationships with other agencies involved in oversight in Iraq, including may colleagues from the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Defense and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation. SIGIR has 16 investigators in Arlington, and we are participating in the new Joint Operations Center located at the FBI to coordinate and enhance fraud investigations in Iraq. SIGIR's first task force was the Special Investigative Task Force for Iraq Reconstruction (SPITFIRE), and it combined the efforts of the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Homeland Security, Immigrations and Customs enforcement office, the FBI and the Department of State Office of Inspector General. That task force was able to effectively pursue the Bloom-Stein conspiracy that my auditors uncovered in Hillah, Iraq--a very egregious kickback and bribery scheme involving over $10 million in reconstruction funds that Philip Bloom, the contractor, and Robert Stein, the Coalition Provisional Authority comptroller for that region, engineered for their own criminal ends. SPITFIRE continues its work today; and we continue to pursue a number of leads that arose from the Bloom-Stein case. The other major task-force initiative that SIGIR has initiated with the FBI is the International Contract Corruption Task Force (ICCTF). ICCTF prompted the creation of the Joint Operations Center mentioned above, which is producing the effective collection and coordination of investigative leads and source development. Although I am not at liberty to discuss details of these cases, I am very pleased with the very significant progress the JOC investigators have made, news of which I expect to be forthcoming later this year. Along with SIGIR, the ICCTF includes the U.S. Army's Criminal Investigative Division's Major Procurement Fraud Unit, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the FBI, and the inspectors general of the Department of State and the Agency for International Development. SIGIR is also part of the DOJ National Procurement Fraud Task Force. We continue to work closely with DOJ in the investigation and prosecution of our cases. Finally, to coordinate efforts in oversight in Iraq, I formed the Iraq Inspector Generals' Council, IIGC, 3 years ago, which brings together every agency with oversight authority in Iraq for a meeting every quarter. The IIGC exists to deconflict and coordinate the member agencies' oversight efforts in Iraq. SIGIR is not limiting its efforts just to addressing contractor misconduct through the criminal justice system. We also refer cases to the U.S. government's administrative debarment and suspension processes. To date, the competent oversight authorities have, through established rules that preserve due process, suspended 17 companies and individuals, debarred ten, and have another nine pending debarments. To date, SIGIR has produced 13 quarterly reports, 86 audit reports, and 90 inspection reports. Our auditors and inspectors regularly refer investigative leads to our investigators some of which have developed into very significant cases. The Bloom-Stein case is just one example. SIGIR's three lessons-learned reports produced to date have provided recommendations on policies designed to improve economy, efficiency and effectiveness for the Iraq program and for future reconstruction and stabilization operations. The reports have prompted the introduction of reform measures in the Congress that will improve contracting processes. SIGIR is at work on a lessons-learned capping report, which will be produced at the end of this year. It is my hope that our lessons learned reports will prompt reforms that will improve the capacity of law enforcement to deter crime. Mr. Chairman, with respect to H.R. 400, Representative Abercrombie's bill entitled the ``War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007,'' our position is essentially what it was when we were asked to reflect on its counterpart at a Senate hearing this past March. SIGIR remains a strong proponent of legislation that would strengthen efforts to punish fraud or abuse in contracting programs in Iraq or elsewhere. We look forward to working with the Department of Justice to enforce H.R. 400, should it become law. We are, however, unaware of instances where the Justice Department was unable to prosecute, under existing law, on the facts we developed in our investigations. One of our responsibilities in Iraq is to encourage efficiency in the reconstruction effort. In that role, we have prompted management to seek the widest possible participation by business enterprises (especially Iraqi firms) in reconstruction. The security risks in Iraq are self-evident, and thus the risks to any business enterprise operating in such an environment are mammoth. International companies likely will not get into the business of reconstruction in Iraq without incentives that render the risk-taking worthwhile. This reality should figure in the development of legislation that affects contracting in Iraq or similarly insecure environments. Whether H.R. 400 becomes law, SIGIR will continue to aggressively pursue investigations, provide robust oversight through audits and inspections, and will press for more efforts to improve contract administration, quality assurance, and quality control. It is my hope that our continuing efforts will help promote an aim we all share--a reconstruction program that is administered and executed honestly, and is as well-managed and efficient as possible under very challenging circumstances. Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, thank you for your time and attention to these important matters, and I look forward to answering your questions.",

    "text": "I want to pay a special thank you, a big mahalo, to Mr. Scott and to the Judiciary Committee for their hard work. I am very grateful to the ranking members, the Republicans and Democrats. We cannot resolve this without seeing to it that we have a bipartisan approach on this.I am particularly grateful to Senator Pat Leahy, who is the Judiciary Chairman in the Senate, for entrusting this bill to our care here in the House and allowing me to introduce it as a companion bill to the one that has passed in the Senate. I am very hopeful that we can get a vote in the Senate and move this to the President's desk.When the wrong computer equipment arrived in Iraq, the contractor ordered it dumped into a mammoth burn pit and placed an order for replacements, rather than sending it back. The government paid for both the wrong computers and the replacements. The contractor collected a fee for each, thanks to a cost-plus contract.Halliburton had drivers driving empty trucks between bases in Iraq, unnecessarily exposing the drivers to danger, because the company was paid by the trip, not by the amount of materiel hauled or a flat fee; $186 million was spent over 2 years to build 142 health care centers, yet only 15 have been completed and only eight are open. According to testimony, the contractor lacked qualified engineers, hired incompetent subcontractors, failed to supervise construction work, and failed to enforce quality control.A large U.S. construction company was paid tens of millions of dollars to repair Iraq's schools. Many of the schools were never touched, and several that were repaired, and I say that in quotes, were left in shambles, one filled with unflushed sewage.At least 10 companies with billions of dollars in contracts have already been forced to pay up to $300 million in penalties to resolve allegations of bid-rigging, fraud, gross overcharging, delivery of faulty military parts and environmental damage, $300 million in penalties. Some of these same companies have faced such allegations during past military operations in other countries, but have had no problem receiving new contracts in Iraq.Despite millions of dollars in payments to U.S. companies, key pieces of Iraq's infrastructure, power plants, telephone exchanges, sewage and sanitation systems, have either not been repaired or have been fixed so poorly that they still don't function.How has this been allowed to happen? The United States Government directly and through the late Coalition Provisional Authority have outsourced the war in Iraq like no other in our history, spending more than $50 billion on private contractors to provide food, water, gasoline and other supplies, guard bases, drive trucks, and many other activities in support of our troops.But consistent with the administration's overall attitude toward spending public money with private companies, little or no thought was given to contract oversight or accountability. As a result, some of these contractors have declared the U.S. occupation of Iraq open season on the taxpayer. Cleaning up this mess has been hampered by the fact that while anti-fraud laws protect against the waste or theft of U.S. taxpayers in the United States, there have been no statutes prohibiting sleazy business practices by American companies overseas.As we have learned in the investigation of the Blackwater USA contract, the Coalition Provisional Authority issued order number 17, which specifically exempted U.S. contractors from Iraqi law.In fact, one contractor was found guilty of 37 counts of fraud, including false billing, and was ordered to pay more than $10 million in damages, but the decision was overturned because the contracts were let through the Coalition Provisional Authority, and it was found that U.S. laws against fraud did not apply.Despite the fact that the Coalition Provisional Authority was created by the Bush administration under the Department of Defense; despite the fact that L. Paul Bremer, the overseer in Iraq, subsequent to the initial attack on Iraq, had an office literally across the hall from Secretary Rumsfeld, the Coalition Provisional Authority was not considered part of the U.S. Government, and, therefore, U.S. laws were unenforceable.These practices are a flagrant abuse of the public's trust and the public's money during a time of war and cannot be allowed to continue. H.R. 400, the War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007, will, one, criminalize war profiteering defined as contract fraud or overcharging for goods and services in connection with the mission of the United States Government overseas; two, violations of law will be a felony and punishable up to 20 years in prison and fines up to $1 million or twice the illegal profits of the crime; three, jurisdiction for such cases, no matter where the alleged crimes are committed, will be in the United States Federal court.H.R. 400 was heard and considered by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security and ordered reported to the full Judiciary Committee by a voice vote on August 1. Among the many significant consequences of the decision to invade and occupy Iraq marked by a complete dismissal of the need for intelligent planning and stunning incompetence in the conduct of the war, this problem has received too little attention from the news media, the public, and the Congress.Most of the cases of fraud, questionable business practices and outright corruption have been uncovered and investigated through the efforts of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, Mr. Stuart Bowen, Jr. Mr. Bowen and his super staff both here in the U.S. and on the ground in Iraq have provided oversight and insight under the most difficult conditions imaginable for billions of American taxpayer dollars intended to rebuild Iraq and support our troops in combat. They deserve our gratitude. They deserve the gratitude of the Congress and the Nation for a tough job well done.Mr. Speaker, this bill, together with H.R. 2740, legislation passed by this House last week to expand the reach of the Uniform Code of Military Justice to private civilian security operatives in the region are two important steps this Congress is taking to clean up the mess in Iraq.H.R. 400, in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, the War Profiteering Prevention Act will help end the open season declared on American taxpayers.",

As Mr. Scott has pointed out, the standard is very high and applies to any contract, whether it's in the United States or overseas. There is nothing applied to the contracts overseas that is not applied to a contract here in the United States when it comes to the question of fraud or overcharging or deliberate deception with regard to the contract. That standard has to be met in any court and has to come before any judge meeting such a standard. There is no differentiation whatsoever.The reason the bill is here, and the reason we're bringing the legislation, is the courts have ruled that there is, at best, an ambiguous situation, if not an outright gap between the capacity for prosecution of such a crime, should the standard for the crime be sustained by a prosecutorial investigation, and what is possible in Iraq. It can't be prosecuted in Iraq, and the courts found that it wasn't. We did not have legislation sufficiently clear in the United States in order to prosecute it. Thus, far from arbitrary or capricious prosecution, we have the opportunity for arbitrary defrauding of the United States taxpayer with no consequences. That's why the legislation is here.",

    "text": "Rather than having a motion to recommit, because I would ask you not to do that for the reasons already enumerated, this deserves our specific attention. And we both know, I think, what happens on a motion to recommit: people come to the floor; they see superficially what's involved. Who can argue about everybody wanting to have civil rights?And I don't want to have to get into a debate with you about the question of recommittal. Here is what section 7 says of the bill, if you would allow me: ``Prior to conferring Federal recognition on a reorganized governing entity, the Secretary of the Interior must certify that the organic governing documents provide for the protection of the civil rights of the citizens of the entity, as well as all other persons affected by the exercise of the entity's governmental powers and authorities. In addition, the organic governing documents must be consistent with applicable Federal law. If the Secretary finds that the organic governing documents, or any part of these documents, do not meet these requirements, the organic governing documents will not be certified.''This has to be certified by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting every Federal responsibility. Now, up until this time, and I am sure you agree, if the Speaker will just grant me a little more time and if you will, this bill has never been subject to partisan rhetoric or activity in the committee or elsewhere. From a realistic point of view, motions to recommit really have to do with who is in charge and who is not in charge and that kind of thing. I am not disputing that your question isn't real. But the motion to recommit essentially is repeating, in some fashion, without my quite knowing what the real consequences of that language would be, whereas the language that I am citing to you from section 7 has been vetted again and again and again by minority staff, majority staff, legal staff all over to fit exactly what the gentleman seeks to succeed with.So I am asking you not to make a motion to recommit on the basis that what I have read to you, in good faith, is language that has been put forward in good faith within the existing bill. And if you conclude that it is not adequate, I pledge to you that I will certainly sit down with you as will Mr. Kildee and anyone else who is interested in it to try and see what we can do to make the language work as the bill moves along. But I don't want to get trapped in a recommital action which may then put language into the bill, the consequences of which I have no idea. Nor, I think, does the gentleman.Your intentions are good. I have complete faith and say so publicly in your intentions and your desire to make this a better bill. So I ask you on the basis of a collegial respect for each other and on the basis of our friendship to let the bill go without a recommital based on section 7 and my promise to you that we will address any and all issues that may still be on the table once you have had a chance to examine the consequences of the language you might otherwise propose.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, this bill before us is the result of years of bipartisan and nonpartisan work, which has been mentioned. I take second to none my regard for Mr. Flake and recitation once again of our personal regard for one another; however, I am afraid that the reason I have to oppose this motion to recommit is for precisely the reasons I mentioned during our previous dialog.I am pleased that he actually read what the motion to recommit says because the part here, and you may recall in my previous commentary where I said we can't be sure what the consequences might be unless we have had a chance to vet them. The bill itself has been vetted again and again by counsel on both sides of the aisle and by groups that have an interest in the bill. This is the consensus that this meets all relevant legal technicalities.Here, look what it says: ``The Native Hawaiian governing entity shall be subject to the United States Constitution's Bill of Rights and other protections in the same manner and to the same extent as a State or local government of the United States.'' That is an invitation to an avalanche of litigation. How are you going to define ``same manner'' and ``same extent'' of a State or local government?The indigenous people, whether they are Native Americans in tribes, whether they are Alaska Natives in corporations, Native Hawaiians trying to put together a government, and they are not a State, they are not a local government, and to say in a motion to recommit that we are going to require them to exactly replicate State and local governments, which is subject to litigation all the time, you would have to have a trust fund set up to handle the litigation, I think, that would result from that.Mr. Speaker, I don't think that that is Mr. Flake's intent. In fact, I would stipulate that that is not his intent. Our problem is we haven't had a chance to sit down and go over this to see whether we can cover any of these contingencies. I wish he had accepted my plea, my offer, and I wish he would stand up now and say, I have seen the light and I am going to withdraw my motion to recommit. Because if you go to number (i), applicability of Federal civil rights laws, it says the same thing with respect to civil rights and antidiscrimination laws in the same manner and to the same extent as a State or local government of the United States.My friends, my colleagues, I agree that Mr. Flake has brought this not for political reasons but because of his sincere belief that this needs to be addressed. I can assure you that if anything is political, this is political by default. Far from saying simply that it is a simple explication of his point of view, it is an absolute wellspring of complication to try and figure out what the same extent of State and local government laws are with regard to civil rights, antidiscrimination or Bill of Rights and other protections. ``Other protections,'' what does that mean? That will be litigated to death.So, Mr. Speaker, I ask Mr. Flake, now that I have analyzed his simple language for him, if he would reconsider withdrawing the motion to recommit. If he does not, I pledge to him now that if we are able to defeat the motion to recommit, which I think should be defeated by anybody who's worked on this bill. I make this final plea in all seriousness, Mr. Speaker. We have worked too hard, come too far on a nonpartisan basis, Republican and Democrat alike, to come to this conclusion and throw ourselves into the briar patch of State and government applicability of laws as recommended in the recommittal. The bill itself deals with all these issues on civil rights.Mr. Speaker, I ask that the motion to recommit be defeated and that we move to a vote, an overwhelming vote on the underlying bill, H.R. 505, which is an exemplary product, a singular stalwart example of what bipartisan work can do in this House of Representatives.Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, inasmuch as this is a discussion on the rule and not necessarily on the bill itself, I would like to confine my remarks, at least in this initial phase of dealing with the issue, on some of the points raised by my good friend and colleague Mr. Hastings. I am appreciative of the points that he raised, because I think they are in need of not so much refutation but perhaps clarification.It is easy to understand why those who are not necessarily familiar, and I am not speaking about Mr. Hastings personally, I am talking about the references that he cited in his commentary, it is easy to understand why people who are not familiar with a little bit of the history of Hawaii could come to some of the conclusions or make some of the observations that they have. Absent the context within which this bill is coming forward, it is understandable. That context then is what I want to establish, so that it becomes clear.I certainly don't want to get in an argument with the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal either, and they are making some quotations there about complete territorial independence.Well, I think what is being referred to there, and what the likelihood of the reference is, is that there was in fact not territorial in the sense of annexation of territory, like the Philippines or Hawaii or Puerto Rico or that kind of thing that occurred during the kind of ``imperial phase'' of the United States, but there was in fact territorial independence, because Hawaii was a kingdom. It is one of the things that kind of gets lost in the shuffle, and that is one of the reasons we are here today, Mr. Speaker.The United States of America has in fact had, over a 175-year period leading up to the overthrow of the kingdom in 1893, a series of treaties and conventions; 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, 1887, dealing with commerce, dealing with trade, dealing with various recognitions. The Kingdom of Hawaii had treaties and conventions with other nations, as well as the United States.So as a result of that history, we have a succession of land claims and assets that have come from the time of the kingdom to the shotgun republic that occurred after the overthrow of the kingdom and the annexation of the United States into the territory, and into finally becoming a State, as was indicated, in 1959. We are in fact the last State to enter the Union, along with Alaska in 1959.I bring this up simply to point out that far from subdividing the American people, as was cited by my good friend, quite the contrary; it incorporates the politics as well as the historical reality of this land secession and the assets associated with it, because this land generates income.Basically what this is about, Mr. Speaker, is land and other assets, including money, and who controls it. When this land came in, it wasn't worth anything. The Wall Street Journal did not comment, I am certain, on the ceded lands. They are called ``ceded lands'' because they were ceded from the kingdom to the succeeding governmental entities. They could care less, the Wall Street Journal, about these lands when they were worth nothing, when they were not seen to be able to be marketed.But let me explain now, and I ask my good friend as I look at him now with a smile on my face, we are talking about land in Hawaii? You are talking big bucks. You are talking money here. That is what this is about is land and money and who controls it. And this land has, from the time of the kingdom, resided with the Native Hawaiians. That is who is to be the beneficiary.That takes me to the point, Mr. Speaker, of the entry into the Union. The Admissions Act requires us, requires us, the Admissions Act of 1959 requires us to utilize those lands and assets for the benefit of Native Hawaiians. That is in the Admissions Act.We are not here on the floor today because we didn't have anything better to do in Hawaii than to try to bring this to the Federal Government. On the contrary, the Admissions Act requires us to make certain that these lands are utilized for the benefit of Native Hawaiians. The reason we have the bill here is that in order to accomplish that, we need to get a governing entity that can come to the Department of the Interior for approval in order to be able to conduct the affairs, similarly to, parallel to what now happens with Native Americans in the so-called lower 48 in the mainland of the United States and with various Alaska Natives and corporations and other entities that have been set up in Alaska.This is a history of indigenous people. They are different from other indigenous people because they were a kingdom, and we would not have the 2 million acres we are talking about had those acres not been associated with an indigenous people. They are not imaginary, they are real.Finally, let me say with Rice v. Cayetano, Governor Cayetano, the first Filipino American to be elected Governor, that issue was settled on a question of voting procedures and had nothing whatsoever to do with programs for Native Hawaiians.",

    "title": "EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR H.R. 760, THE ``FILIPINO VETERANS EQUITY ACT OF 2007''",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my deep support for H.R. 760, the ``Filipino Veterans Equity Act of 2007.''The treatment of Filipinos who fought with the United States Armed Forces in World War II is a dark chapter in American history. The Philippines became a United States possession after Spain ceded it as part of the treaty ending the Spanish-American War in 1898. In 1934, Congress created a 10-year time frame for independence through the ``Philippine Independence Act.'' However, since the Philippines remained a colonial possession until 1946 the United States retained the right to call upon military forces organized by the Philippine Government into the United States Armed Forces.On July 26, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a military order that brought the Philippine Commonwealth Forces under the control of the United States Armed Forces during World War II. These men bravely fought with our own troops during the war, and many perished or suffered severe wounds from the battles in the Western Pacific Theater. After the surrender of Japan, Congress required the Philippine Forces to continue their service. Many helped occupy lands, many oversaw military operations, and many made the ultimate sacrifice to secure our victory in World War II. Yet, when wartime service ended formally in 1946 they did not receive the same benefits and the same treatment as other American soldiers.Yet, for all their heroic and courageous actions, Congress passed the ``Recession Act'' in February 1946, to the objection of many, including General Macarthur. This essentially denied Filipino Veterans any of the benefits that their American comrades in arms received; including full access to veterans' health care, service-connected disability compensation, non-service connected disability compensation, dependent indemnity compensation, death pension, and full burial benefits. No other group of veterans has been systematically denied these benefits.Congress has the opportunity to right this wrong. H.R. 760 restores the benefits these brave warriors were denied. This legislation has been introduced since 1992. However, time is running out. In September 2000, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) estimated that the number of surviving Filipino Veterans is 59,889. However, by 2010, VA estimates that their population will dwindle to just 20,000, because of their advanced age.Many argue that paying for Filipino veterans is not something Congress should undertake, because they are not U.S. citizens, and that the PAYGO offsets takes money away from Americans. However, such a statement fails to recognize that Filipino veterans served not merely as allies, but as U.S. forces. It fails to recognize that the United States made the same promise to provide for these veterans' needs as it does to any other person who serves in uniform; a promise that we have, up to now, failed to uphold.Congress must act now for the sake of justice and to show that we Americans truly appreciate the sacrifice these men made. Let us remember the heroism of these veterans by honoring their service and fulfilling our commitments to them. I urge the House to consider and pass this important measure.",

We have two identical, competing committees by design. Now, I defy anybody in this House to go to your next Rotary Club meeting and try to explain what that is all about.Any referral to the Office of Congressional Ethics will be seen as tantamount to a guilty verdict.

This is about the House, and its membership should decide whether any Member has failed to meet its standards, not appointees who have not served or are not currently Members of the House.An ethics investigation is by definition peer review. Any appointee to the Office of Congressional Ethics who has not served in the House has no credibility in terms of judging Members or the conduct of House standards.And does anybody believe that complaints won't be in the media immediately, regardless of validity? The press irritation with the House Ethics Committee is because it has actually practiced confidentiality.This is an invitation to ideological mischief and character assassination. We say this is about our ability to police ourselves. The effect will be just the opposite. The House Ethics Committee no longer has any discernable function other than to affirm whatever has been referred to it.All this makes me sad, and it makes me angry. I have devoted every bit of energy in my life for nine terms to this House. I revere the opportunity for service in the people's House. With this proposal we are indicting ourselves.

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.H.R. 4933, the Captive Wildlife Safety Technical Amendments Act of 2008, was introduced by my colleague from Guam (Ms. Bordallo). As Mr. Kennedy indicated, unfortunately, she cannot be here in person at the moment because she is on her way here from Guam, but hopefully will arrive before the end of the proceedings. Coming as I do, Madam Speaker, on a 5,000 mile one-way commute, I have a lot of empathy and sympathy for her journey. But the issue before us today is very, very important both to her and to Members of the House and, by extension, the Nation.The Captive Wildlife Safety Act, Public Law 108-191, amended the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981, and that made it unlawful for any person to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any prohibited wildlife species.After the law was enacted, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Justice identified technical drafting problems that made full implementation and enforcement impossible. H.R. 4933 would make those technical changes to the law needed to allow the original intent of the legislation to be achieved.Madam Speaker, on a personal note, I might add that, under Chairman Pombo, I had the privilege of traveling with him to Africa for the CITES, Convention on International Treaty on Endangered Species, so we could see with our own eyes what the consequences are by not having legislation like this correctly in place. The wildlife species are totally dependent upon human beings as the stewards of this planet and, most certainly, as the stewards of their welfare and for the salvation of endangered species, not just in our country, but overseas as well. Therefore, I ask Members on both sides to support passage of this noncontroversial bill.May I say also, Madam Speaker, what a privilege it is to be on the floor with Mr. Bishop of Utah.

    "title": "INTRODUCTION OF NCAA FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP EQUITY RESOLUTION",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, today I have joined with my colleagues Congressman Simpson of Idaho and Congressman Westmoreland of Georgia in introducing a resolution to end disparity in college sports that is an unintended consequence of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). This resolution declares the BCS an illegal restraint on trade, and demands that the US Department of Justice take the proper actions to investigate and end the unfair BCS system. It also encourages the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to establish a true football playoff system to determine the national collegiate football champion in the interest of parity and sportsmanship.The BCS is fundamentally unfair. Non-BCS schools, those in conferences not automatically qualified for the BCS bowls, are at a disadvantage prior to the first kickoff of the season. Non-BCS schools must basically have perfect seasons, and must be the best of over 50 schools to even be considered to play in a BCS bowl, while schools that belong to conferences that are automatically-qualified for BCS bowls (BCS schools) must only be the best of 8-12 schools, depending on the conference they compete in. Six of the ten schools that participate in the BCS bowls qualify by becoming the regular season champion of a BCS automatically-qualifying conference: the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), Big 10, Big 11, Big Fast, Pacific-10. and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The four others are determined based on rankings, conference standings, and in some cases, selected by bowl officials. There is also a rule prohibiting more than one non-BCS school from competing in a single year.These unfair eligibility requirements produce effects that go far beyond restricting access to playing for the national championship. The BCS generates hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue annually, and this money is disproportionately awarded to BCS conferences. Of the more than $217 million generated by the 2006-2007 post-season bowls, $185 million, or 85 percent went to the BCS schools, which represent 66, or 55 percent of Division I schools. Money generated by the post-season games help schools cover costs for their athletic departments, facilities, equipment, recruitment, and other sports programs. Non-BCS schools must use their general funds to cover costs of their athletic departments, which takes funding from academic and administrative needs.The lopsided distribution of BCS revenue results in two tiers within the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division 1), those with access to the BCS, and those without. Those without are unable to change their situation as the money and prestige associated with the BCS makes it highly unlikely that a non-BCS school will be able to compete for the same recruits, coaches, sponsorships, national television exposure, and the revenue it generates. This disparity keeps them in the second-class status and must be changed.Questions about the legality of the BCS have also arisen. Legal scholars have analyzed the anti-trust aspects of the BCS, and some have concluded that the BCS violates the Sherman Anti-Trust Act under the Rule of Reason test. This requires that the competitive benefits of the system outweigh the anti-competitive effects. However, the anti-competitive effects of the financial gain and recruiting advantage of the BCS schools can easily outweigh the pro-competitive benefits of arranging for the top two ranking BCS teams to play for the national championship.Many have called for the end of or change to the BCS, and the current system is only the latest reincarnation. The NCAA has, on multiple occasions, studied and considered moving to a playoff to determine the national champion. Successful BCS school football coaches and presidents have called for a playoff system, as have presidents of non-BCS schools. Congress has held multiple hearings questioning the fairness of the BCS and states have introduced and passed legislation calling for changes to the system.NCAA football is the only college team sport without a playoff determining the national champion. While the NCAA Basketball Championship's format will not transfer perfectly to college football, it is an ideal system. All Division I schools start the season with an equal chance of making it to the playoffs. The championship is decided on the court by the players and their talent, not rankings and their schedule before the tournament. The basketball championship also allows for a nearly annual ``Cinderella story,'' an underrated team that defies expectations, upsets traditionally strong opponents and competes deep into the tournament. This year it was Davidson College, a member of the Southern Conference, which was seeded tenth in its region and made it to the Elite Eight, beating former champion Georgetown University, the University of Wisconsin and Gonzaga University along the way. This scenario is highly unlikely in the BCS system, as there is little chance for a non-BCS school to even be offered an invitation to play. Non-BCS schools, the University of Hawaii in 2008 and Boise State University in 2007 were undefeated going into the BCS and were not even given the opportunity to play for the national championship.Something must be done to ensure that money and opportunity are evenly distributed among all college football programs. Congress should act in the interest of all the athletes, coaches, staff and supporters to guarantee parity and competition in college football. The current system leaves much to be desired and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution calling for the NCAA Division I national champion to be determined by a playoff.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 5613, the ``Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act of 2008,'' a bill that I proudly cosponsored. The bill would place a 1-year moratorium on proposed Medicaid regulations by the Bush administration intended to save money.Unfortunately, these cuts would take Federal funds from States at a time that many are struggling to meet obligations within Medicaid and other programmatic areas. By limiting access to rehabilitation and targeted case management services, the administration cynically attacks the poorest and weakest members of our society. Eliminating the reimbursement for transportation services for certain special needs students would deny them the basic right to an education. The regulations halt important payments to hospitals at a time that many across the Nation and within my home State of Hawaii are actually losing money.Placing the 1-year moratorium would help us better asses the full impact of these disastrous cuts, and come up with a plan that controls the growing costs of Medicaid without harming quality, as these regulations seem to do. The extent of the unpopularity of these cuts is clearly shown by the expedited move by the Committee on Energy and Commerce to report the bill unanimously to the House floor, in contravention of the President's veto threat.Medicaid provides medical coverage for the poorest and neediest of our country. It is the insurer of last resort for many who have either lost jobs or are barely subsisting. To take away these funds at this time is cruel and undermines the intent of the very program. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.",

    "title": "COMMEMORATING ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Asian Pacific American--APA--Heritage Month. I am pleased to celebrate this important event.May 2008 marks 30 years since President Jimmy Carter signed a joint Congressional resolution declaring the first 10 days of May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Week. In 1992, the commemoration was extended to the full month of May.While it's an appropriate time to note the achievements of Asian Pacific Americans, APAs, we cannot overlook the needs of the community, including a fair and sensible immigration policy. I chair the Immigration Task Force of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus's, CAPAC, and I will continue to fight for the needs of family within the immigration debate.The challenge has become much more difficult in the last year because the presidential primary campaigns have poisoned the discussion, focusing all their attention on undocumented immigrants from Mexico and calls for higher fences and tougher enforcement. Completely ignored is the fact that immigration issues facing Asian and Pacific Americans are far different. And those issues have been completely drowned out by the shrill demonization of illegal immigrants.One of the major issues for the Asian Pacific American community is family reunification: allowing relatives of legal permanent residents, other than spouses and minor children, to immigrate legally and join their families. It can take the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) as long as 23 years to even consider an application for a family member from the Philippines.The extended family is a foundation in many of our cultures, and it provides real benefits to the greater society as well. Families often pool resources to educate children or purchase homes and establish roots in their communities. We often see extended family networks starting businesses, providing economic development and jobs.It is important that we move the debate on immigration past the bumper sticker solutions that have dominated the public dialog and work together to advocate for the needs of family. I believe we must find a just, practical and humane response to the 12 million undocumented immigrants living in the shadows of our society. But, we cannot forget that families that are separated tear at the very fabric of what America means. I urge my colleagues to learn more about this issue during APA Heritage Month and throughout the year, and work for comprehensive and human immigration reform for the APA community.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I have the honor to serve as the chairman of the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee of our Armed Services Committee. I would like first to thank my own personal archbishop, Doug Roach, and all the acolytes on the Air and Land subcommittee, the subcommittee staff. They do a terrific job working with Ike Skelton's overall staff, led by Erin. I cannot tell you what a pleasure it is every day to be working with them in the manner in which they conduct themselves; professional, disciplined, focused, something I wish I could say about myself more often than I do.Again, on the personal comment side, I want to thank my good friend, Duncan Hunter. Always, without fail, in all these years, attentive, polite, always welcoming commentary and seeking advice. We may say farewell to you, Duncan, but we will not be saying goodbye.Finally, Mr. Jim Saxton, whom I don't see on the floor today. Jim Saxton may have his position taken, but no one is going to replace him in this Congress. He has been my friend. He has been my mentor. I have served as a ranking member on various committees, not just here, but on other committees, as well as having the opportunity to chair. I never considered myself a ranking member or a chairman where Jim Saxton was concerned. We were colleagues.This bill is about balancing the capabilities and readiness of our current military forces with future required military capabilities. Our military personnel is at risk each and every day. The first priority is to make sure the men and women in uniform are properly supported by ensuring our military programs adequately support current military requirements.We cannot short-change our personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan in their need for adequate equipment and the needs of our National Guard units here at home for what they may require to respond to potential national disasters. Promised future capabilities that have already been delayed because of overly optimistic and unmet schedules cannot subsume meeting today's demonstrated needs.The Air and Land Forces Subcommittee's jurisdiction includes $90 billion in Army and Air Force programs. Our objective, Mr. Chairman, is clear, to ensure that our military personnel get the best available equipment as soon as it has been properly tested, equipment like armored vehicles, body armor, improvised explosive device jammers, unmanned aerial vehicles, small arms, and night vision devices.We address key requirements: An increase in Army procurement and research of $557 million over the budget request, procurement and research where it's needed now, demonstrating the commitment of the Armed Services Committee to meeting these many needs. The Army in particular is carrying the heaviest burden of all the services in the war in which we are now engaged. This bill shifts funding to critical Army priorities now; $2.6 billion to fund sustainments costs for the tactical vehicle referred to as the MRAP, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle, to better protect our personnel against mines and improvised explosive devices; $2.7 billion for counterimprovised explosive device programs, $949 million for Humvees, $783 million for body armor; $800 million for funding for much-needed National Guard and Reserve equipment.Yes, we have reallocated funds in this budget where we have to meet the needs of the serving Army and Air Force today.Fifteen C-17 strategic airlift aircraft added, at a cost of $3.9 billion dollars. It maintains the C-17 production line and sustains the strategic airlift fleet. Joint Strike Fighter competitive engine program has been funded for $526 million to provide necessary competition of two producers of engines for that program; $246 million added for systems to counter rocket and mortar attacks on our forces.To fund these priorities, we had to make reallocation choices to fund the highest priorities. Some programs will have to make adjustments. No program is adversely compromised. On the contrary, increased accountability and increased oversight are the result.In closing, I want to thank the distinguished chairman, all the ranking members of the full committee and the subcommittees, and may I say, Mr. Skelton, as I close, that it is a particular pleasure and an honor to serve with you. As I stand here today, I am thinking of Suzie Skelton. I know how proud she is of you.",

    "title": "RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DRUG COURT MONTH",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the nine drug courts in my State and around the country during National Drug Court Month. Over 2,100 drug courts in the United States provide an alternative to incarceration for non-violent, drug-addicted offenders by combining intense judicial supervision, comprehensive substance abuse and mental health treatment, random and frequent drug testing, incentives and sanctions, clinical case management and ancillary life skills services. The tireless efforts of the judges, prosecutors. defense attorneys, treatment providers, rehabilitation experts, child advocates, researchers, educators, law enforcement representatives, correctional representatives, pre-trial officers and probation officers that are involved in drug courts provide substance abusing offenders with the much-needed chance at long-term recovery and productive lifestyles.I have seen firsthand the impact of the drug courts in my State, where drug court programs have enhanced public safety, saved taxpayer dollars and, most importantly, saved lives. Since opening their doors, Hawaii's drug courts have graduated over 840 adult clients, 180 family clients, and 81 juvenile clients statewide. During fiscal year 2006, the recidivism rate for adult graduates was a mere 8 percent. For juvenile clients the recidivism rate was 13 percent. Family drug court clients experienced no recidivism whatsoever in 2006.As we face a growing population of drug-addicted offenders in the American justice system, we must expand our efforts to bring treatment to a larger number of those in need. According to a recent study by the Urban Research Institute's Justice Policy Center, approximately 1.5 million drug-involved offenders should be diverted to drug court, which would generate $46 billion in savings to American taxpayers. Armed with our existing research that drug courts work, reduce recidivism, and save lives and money, we must work on taking drug courts to scale.If society is truly going to save the lives of the addicted, break the familial cycle of addiction for future generations, have a substantial impact on associated crime, child abuse and neglect, reduce poverty, alleviate the over-reliance on incarceration for the addicted, and reduce many of the public health consequences in the United States, drug courts must be taken to scale. There is no greater opportunity for systemic social change in the American justice system. There is no greater opportunity to heal families and communities.Again, congratulations to the dedicated drug court professionals and graduates from Hawaii and around the country on a job well done.",

    "title": "MEDICARE IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS ACT OF 2008--Continued",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6331, the ``Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act of 2008.'' This bill makes some important changes in the Medicare program that help assure access for our seniors to quality medical care.The bill defers the 10.6% cut in physician reimbursements mandated by the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) that would go into effect on July 1, 2008. Instead, the bill continues the present reimbursement rate for 18 months and then increases it by 1.1%.The bill also provides important improvements for our senior citizens, increasing the allowable income and asset maximums for premium assistance. The co-payments for mental health services are reduced from 50% to 20%, the same as any other doctor visit.The legislation addresses problems within Medicare to pay for these benefits, reforming the system that overpays to Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, private plans that operate within Medicare, which cost the government on average 12% more than traditional services. The bill will also require that any delinquent taxes owed by Medicare providers be deducted from their Medicare reimbursements.In addition to improving Medicare services, the legislation also makes important changes to Medicaid, including a provision that is particularly vital for the people of Hawaii: Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments.Following an oversight in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, only Hawaii and Tennessee have not received DSH payments in Medicaid, which provide additional support to hospitals that treat large numbers of Medicaid and uninsured patients. This bill provides a temporary remedy, which will help keep these hospitals open.I have been working with Senator Daniel Akaka, the Hawaii Delegation and my colleagues on the Committee on Energy and Commerce to ensure that Hawaii and Tennessee receive equal treatment in the matter of DSH payments from the Federal Government. H.R. 6631 extends DSH payments for Hawaii and Tennessee through December 31, 2009, and provides an additional $15 million for Hawaii. This extension authorizes the submission by the State of Hawaii of a State plan amendment covering a DSH payment methodology to hospitals which is consistent with the requirements of existing law. The purpose of providing a DSH allotment for Hawaii is to provide additional funding to the State of Hawaii to permit a greater contribution toward the uncompensated costs of hospitals that are providing indigent care. It is not meant to alter existing arrangements between the State of Hawaii and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) or to reduce in any way the level of Federal funding for Hawaii's QUEST program.I will continue to work toward a permanent solution to the DSH matter, but until then, I urge my colleagues to support this measure. It is not an earmark, but merely provides Hawaii and Tennessee equity with everyone else.Again I want to thank Chairman Rangel, Chairman Dingell, Chairman Pallone, and Chairman Stark on this important piece of legislation that protects our seniors and provides equity for the State of Hawaii. I urge my colleagues to pass this vital bill.",

Res. 1436, a resolution to congratulate the Waipio Little League Team from the State of Hawaii for winning the 2008 Little League World Series.On August 24, 2008, the Waipio Little League baseball team won the Little League World Championship. Waipio defeated the Matamoros Little League team of Tamaulipas, Mexico, 12-3. This is the most runs scored by one team in a World Series title game since 1998. Waipio's victory by nine runs is also the largest winning margin by a US team over an international opponent in the title game,To get to the Little League World Series, Wapio went undefeated through the season. They went 3-0 in pool play, defeating teams from Connecticut, Florida and South Dakota. On August 20, 2008, Waipio won the United States Semifinal by defeating Mill Creek Little League, from Mill Creek, Washington. Then on August 23, 2008, they won the United States Championship by defeating South Lake Charles Little League, of Lake Charles, Louisiana. During this game, the team was down 5-1, but persevered and came back in the sixth and final inning by scoring six runs, to win the game 7-5.I would like to congratulate each member of the team and recognize their spirit and determination that got them so far: Iolana Akau, Jedd Andrade, Christian Donahue, Caleb Duhay, Ulumano Farm, Kainoa Fong, Trevor Ling, Keelen Obedoza, Khade Paris, Tanner Tokunaga, Jordan Ulep, Pikai Winchester, Matthew Yap, Manager Timo Donahue, Coach Kiha Akau, and Coach Gregg Tsukawa.Just as important, this resolution commends the team's families, coaches, and community for their support and dedication to enabling the success of the team on and off the field. Without this support, the team could not have traveled such a tremendously triumphant road.I would like to thank Chairman Henry Waxman and Ranking Member Tom Davis for the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's support in advancing this resolution. I would also like to thank Representative Mazie Hirono, Representative Eni Faleomavaega and Representative Madeleine Bordallo for their unflagging support and also that of Representative John Peterson, whose district hosts the Little League WorId Series.I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Waipio Little League Baseball team and their accomplishments and ask for your support of H.

Dr. Navin, a resident of Honolulu, has made many valuable contributions to the field of medicine not only in Hawaii, but throughout the United States.Dr. Navin began his medical career with the United States Army and has also served in the United States Army Reserve as well as the Hawaii Army Reserve National Guard, serving both Tripler General Hospital and Fort DeRussey. Dr. Navin is a recipient of the Bronze Star, as well as the Army Commendation Medal.He is the current president of the Hawaii Society of Pathologists, and a member of a variety of pathology related specialties, including the Hawaii Medical Association, the Honolulu County Medical Society, the College of American Pathologists and the American Society of Cytopathologists.I came to know Dr. Navin as a passionate healthcare advocate in the 1990s.

    "title": "GUAM WORLD WAR II LOYALTY RECOGNITION ACT",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support legislation that has been introduced by my colleague, Congresswoman Bordallo. H.R. 44, the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act, would honor the residents of Guam for their loyalty and compensate them for the atrocities they suffered during the long and violent Japanese occupation of Guam.During World War II, Guam was invaded, seized and occupied by Imperial Japanese forces for nearly three years. The war destroyed much of Guam, including housing, public buildings, utilities and infrastructure. In addition, the people of Guam suffered many deaths and an untold number of acts of brutality. This ruthless brutality has left a lasting impact on the survivors of the war and the descendants of victims. These sufferers wanted nothing more than survival and liberation under the U.S. flag.In 1947, the Secretary of the Navy commissioned a civilian committee on the Naval Administration of Guam and American Samoa to prepare a report with specific recommendations. The report became known as the Hopkins Report and was submitted to the Secretary of the Navy in 1947. Among other things, the report addressed deficiencies in the war claims process for Guam immediately after the war ended. In the cover letter submitted with the report, the committee stated, ``Only so can justice be done to a valiant group of Americans who at great cost to themselves remained steadfastly loyal during the war . . . in so special a case this government could well be very generous in method of distributing its relief as well as generous in amount awarded. It has been neither.''Many decades later, the 107th Congress authorized the Guam War Claims Review Commission to determine if the people of Guam received parity in claims as compared to other Americans who experienced losses and damages during the war. In 2004, the Commission submitted their final report to Congress and found that Guam's residents were inequitably treated.There has been legislation to address this inequitable treatment in every Congress since 1985. Two hearings have been held, one in the 108th Congress and one on in the 109th Congress. In the 110th Congress, the House passed H.R. 1595 under a suspension of the rules but the Senate was not able to act on the measure before final adjournment. It is time to follow the recommendations made by both the Hopkins report and the Guam War Claims Review Commission by providing adequate reparations for the people of Guam. It is time to honor them for their sacrifices.Congresswoman Bordallo continues to call for a resolution to this open wound and has done a fantastic job over the years to create the most fair and equitable legislation that Congress can pass. I hope the people of Guam know that this issue is being addressed and the people have not been forgotten.I urge my colleagues to support the people of Guam and vote for final passage.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2009, a bill to affirm and formalize the long political relationship between Native Hawaiians and the United States. This measure clarifies that political bond and provides a process for Native Hawaiians to form their own governing body and participate in a government-to-government relationship with the United States. This is a companion measure to legislation being introduced by Senator Daniel Akaka in the Senate this evening.The United States recognized the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hawaii more than 175 years ago, accorded the Kingdom full diplomatic recognition and entered into treaties and conventions in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875 and 1887, all ratified by Congress. The United States has declared in law a special responsibility for the welfare of the Native peoples of the United States, including Native Hawaiians.P.L. 103-150, the Apology Resolution, extended an apology to the Native people of Hawaii on behalf of the United States for our country's role in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893. The Apology Resolution also expressed the commitment of Congress and the President to acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow, and to support reconciliation efforts between the United States and Native Hawaiians.This relationship was explicitly affirmed in the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, which set aside 200,000 acres of land for homesteading by Native Hawaiians. Legislative history clearly shows that Congress based this action and subsequent legislation on the constitutional precedent in programs enacted to benefit Native Americans. In fact, since Hawaii's admission into the Union fifty years ago, Congress has legislated on behalf of Native Hawaiians, including them as Native Americans in numerous statutes.The legislation I am introducing today is important not only to Native Hawaiians, but to everyone in Hawaii. It provides a process to address many longstanding issues facing Hawaii's indigenous peoples and the State of Hawaii. In addressing these matters, we have begun a process of healing, a process of reconciliation not only between the United States and the Native people of Hawaii, but within the State of Hawaii.The essence of Hawaii lies not in the allure of its islands, but in the beauty of its people. The State of Hawaii has recognized the need to preserve the culture, tradition, language and heritage of its indigenous peoples. This measure gives form to the U.S. government's responsibilities in that same effort.",

    "title": "AUTHORIZING USE OF EMANCIPATION HALL FOR KING KAMEHAMEHA CELEBRATION",
    "text": "Mr. Brady, thank you for yielding.Mr. Speaker, Representative Hirono has given an excellent history of Kamehameha and the reasoning behind the celebration of his birthday as a State holiday in Hawaii. For the benefit of the Members and those who may not be familiar with the question of the statue itself and what it represents in the broader context, for those who may not be familiar with it, I would like to perhaps give a little bit of perspective, a little history on it.When people come from all over the world, not just the country itself, the Nation itself, to the Capitol, when they tour the Capitol, the most open capitol of any in the world, perhaps in the history of the world, we take pride, do we not, in the fact that this Capitol is open and available and accessible to all people, and we take some degree of pride, and rightfully so, that we are able to exhibit some of the history of this Nation for all to see and that each State has the opportunity to present for consideration of all of us two statues.One, of course, for us is Father Damien, who has just been named as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church. He came from Belgium to the United States to then, of course, the territory of Hawaii and ministered to those who had Hansen's disease, leprosy, on the Island of Molokai on the peninsula of Kalaupapa. His ministrations to those who had been abandoned, those who literally had been exiled to Kalaupapa resulted in the consideration by the Roman Catholic Church of miracles having been taken place in his name as a result of his dedication.The other statue representative of what we feel Hawaii is all about, of course, is Kamehameha. He's a legendary figure. The things that Representative Hirono cited, of course, are part of history. But when we use the word ``legendary'' to describe someone, it genuinely fits Kamehameha the Great.In his youth as part of this legendary history, he was known as a courageous warrior. He was said to have overturned the Naha Stone in Hilo, Hawaii, which indicated his almost superhuman strength and foreshadowed his inevitable conquest of all of Hawaii. I suppose it is the equivalent or a parallel could be drawn to the seizure of the Excalibur sword from the ground by the legendary King Arthur. This is the stature of Kamehameha. He did, in fact, unify the islands. And when he passed away in 1819, the phrase that was used with his passing is that ``only the stars know his final resting place.'' So the legend became even more of a tale to be told not only throughout the islands but throughout the world.So when people see that statue, when they observe that statue, they're somewhat shocked. It's monumental. I recall very, very clearly that in the rather obscure corner in Statuary Hall where Kamehameha originally resided here in the Capitol, it was somewhat difficult to find. People were not quite sure why it was there. It was said that because of the great weight of the statue itself it had to go there in order to be supported by the flooring of the Capitol. So in that position, Mr. Speaker, the really triumphant power and grace of the statue was not necessarily fully available to those who came to Statuary Hall. As a result, the Architect of the Capitol said to me, when we were first discussing the question of the visitor center and what is now Emancipation Hall, that he wanted very much to have the statue of Kamehameha in a very prominent position when the new visitor center was opened. He was certain that it would occupy an enormous presence there. It does that today. And we are very, very grateful for the opportunity for all to come and to view it.LUNGREN of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.",

    "title": "NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010",
    "text": "Mr. Chair, I have the honor of serving as the Chairman of the Air and Land Forces Subcommittee of our Armed Services Committee. I would like to thank our Chairman, Ike Skelton, for his great leadership in bringing this outstanding bill to this point. I also welcome the new Ranking Member, Buck McKeon, and am confident that he and Chairman Skelton will make a great team.I would also like to thank Roscoe Bartlett, our subcommittee's ranking member, for all his support and advice in putting our bill together.This bill is about balancing the capabilities and readiness of our current military forces with desired future required military capabilities.Our military personnel are at risk each and every day. Our first priority is to make sure those men and women are properly supported by ensuring our military programs adequately support current military requirements.We are doing everything possible to provide our personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan the equipment they need as well as provide for the equipment needs of our National Guard units here at home, to meet crisis response and potential natural disaster requirements. The subcommittee's jurisdiction includes $82 billion in Department of Defense procurement and research and development in Titles I and II and another $20 billion in Title XV, for overseas contingency operations.We have made nearly $3 billion in reallocations within the Subcommittee, funding higher priority current requirements, using funds from programs with excessive unexpended balances, delayed execution, and excessive cost growth.Our Subcommittee increased the unfunded requirements of the Army and Air Force by over $1 billion by reallocating funding from these lower priority projects. The mark also provides an additional $603 million for procurement and research and development of the F136 competitive engine for the F-35 aircraft program. This is largely offset by rebalancing within the F-35 program, by reducing procurement from 32 to 30 aircraft.Nearly $2.7 billion is authorized for 176 Apache, Kiowa, Black Hawk, and Chinook helicopters and an additional $1.2 billion is provided for helicopter modifications. Our bill:Fully funds elements of the Future Combat Systems program that will continue in some form, at $2.55 billion;Provides $2.5 billion for new and upgraded Army ground combat vehicles;Provides $263 million for research and development of future Army ground combat vehicle upgrades and improvements; andProvides $600 million for National Guard and Reserve Equipment, above and beyond what is in the budget request.The change by the National Guard to an operational reserve status, coincident with a reorganization of the Army, has greatly increased the amount of equipment Guard and Reserve units are required to have. While the Department is making improvements and progress in providing improved funding to equip the National Guard and Reserve to enhance its role as an operational reserve, there are a significant number of units that do not have their required equipment.Given the operational reserve equipage model, a large percentage of nondeployed Army National Guard units are far below Army standards for equipment on hand. Without the right type and amounts of equipment, even the most dedicated and experienced soldier or airman cannot train for combat, or provide adequate assistance when there is a domestic emergency.The committee continues to work on improving intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, known as ISR capabilities, as well as improving counter improvised explosive device technology, vehicle armor, body armor, and helmet protection. Like many other mission areas in the Department of Defense, there is no apparent nexus for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance joint strategy, requirements coordination, acquisition or deployment focus, where a single lead organization is responsible.An example that can be cited is the unplanned and expensive proliferation of dissimilar ISR platforms all seeking to provide the same capability.Coalition forces control the skies in both theaters and has the world's best ISR technology, but does not use this advantage to full advantage.The Department still fails to provide joint ISR employment plans for both Iraq and Afghanistan. This bill directs the Department to assess the current use of ISR systems in Iraq and Afghanistan and make recommendations on how to more effectively coordinate and use all the systems we have deployed and plan to deploy.The committee has in the past directed the Department to define joint ISR requirements and develop a long-term strategic plan to make informed acquisition decisions to meet ISR goals. That continues to be a work in progress.It is widely reported that our soldiers in Afghanistan routinely carry loads of 130 to 150 lbs for a 3-day mission. Personnel can only wear so much armor, beyond which their operational effectiveness is inhibited, which in turn increases their risk of being injured. Two provisions in our bill require the Secretary of Defense, beginning with the fiscal year 2011 budget request, to establish research and development program elements and procurement budget line items for the development and acquisition of body armor and personnel protection enhancements.The language also strongly encourages the Secretary of Defense to consider establishing a DOD-wide Task Force on par with the MRAP Vehicle Task Force to promote weight reduction initiatives for body armor.The bill fully funds the President's request of approximately $700 million for body armor.With regard to the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle program, over 16,000 vehicles have been produced in just over two years. Approximately 15,000 vehicles have been fielded and these vehicles continue to save lives daily. Almost $26.0 billion has been provided by Congress for this program.This bill fully funds the President's request of $5.45 billion for MRAP category vehicles. The request procures approximately 1,000 MRAP All-Terrain Vehicles, a lighter weight version of the current MRAP Vehicle, to be used in Afghanistan. The request also provides operation, maintenance, and sustainment funding as well as necessary funds to address home-station training requirements.The bill provides $5.25 billion for light, medium, and heavy tactical wheeled vehicles or ``Humvees'' and ``trucks.'' This funding keeps the industrial base operating at high levels of production and will help address shortfalls in the Guard and Reserve components. In closing, I again want to thank my distinguished chairman and ranking member of the full committee and our subcommittee.H.R. 2647 is deserving of a ``yes'' vote from every Member of this body.",

    "title": "DISABLED MILITARY RETIREE RELIEF ACT OF 2009",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2990, the Disabled Military Retiree Relief Act of 2009. This important legislation will finally address the issue of concurrent receipt, as well as other significant issues that plague public employees. One key issue affecting federal employees in Hawaii is the long-awaited transition from a Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) to locality pay, as is currently used on the mainland United States.Equitable retirement pay for federal employees outside the contiguous 48 states is a concern shared by the approximately 50,000 civil servants living in Alaska, Hawaii and the U.S. territories. The current cost of living adjustment (COLA) provided to federal employees outside the continental United States has created a retirement inequity between them and their mainland counterparts. If federal service in non-contiguous areas is seen as a detriment to future financial security, our government will have an increasingly difficult time attracting and retaining the very best personnel. Further, federal workers should not have to resort to completing their final years of service on the mainland just to earn adequate retirement pay.I think this bill is an important step in addressing the inequality between those serving in the continental United States and those in more remote locations, such as Alaska, Hawaii and the territories. Federal employees throughout the nation are making an equal contribution to the health, well-being and security of our nation. Regardless of where they live, they deserve equal treatment and should not be penalized in their retirement for choosing to contribute to the local communities outside the 48 contiguous states.I believe that all federal employees will be better off under this bill than under the COLA system because their entire pay will now be counted toward their retirement benefits. Moreover, with COLA rates scheduled to decrease for many locations this year, and territories such as American Samoa receiving none, now is the time to act.Please join me in supporting H.R. 2990 and ensuring retirement equity for all federal employees regardless of their location.",

    "title": "CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2009",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to address an issue raised by my colleagues regarding Hawaii's Keiki Care program as a reason not to expand SCHIP. It was suggested earlier today that the Keiki (meaning ``child'') Care program was cancelled due to perceived crowd-out, a situation where parents drop their children's private insurance in order to enroll into a free government program.I have supported the State Legislature's efforts to expand health care coverage for children and followed the implementation of Keiki Care closely. The statements made about a crowd-out problem leading to the program's demise were baseless. The Keiki Care program had no problems with crowd-out. First of all, it was intentionally designed to prevent such behavior in requiring that children who wish to enroll must be uninsured continuously for 6 months. Secondly, if parents were indeed hoping to drop their insurance and wait 6 months to enroll, then Keiki Care would have seen a spike in enrollment. Blue Cross Blue Shield Hawaii, the health insurance provider for Keiki Care, did not see any spikes in enrollment and have no evidence to believe crowd-out occurred.Furthermore, there was little incentive for parents to switch to the Keiki Care program from any private health plan. The health insurance plan offered under Keiki Care was basic preventative care. This means that parents would have had to pay for expanded care costs out of pocket. In looking closer at the Keiki Care program, it is evident that a parent with a full coverage plan for their child would have no incentive to drop a private insurance for this basic, prevention-centered plan.The State Administration has given various explanations regarding the decision to end Keiki Care, including a growing budget deficit. However, the facts about the program are clear. There was never a problem regarding crowd-out and if continued, the program would have helped to cover more of Hawaii's uninsured children. Therefore, Madam Speaker, it is my hope that by clarifying the details regarding Keiki Care, it will no longer be used as a rationale that has no basis in fact against SCHIP or other efforts to expand health insurance to children and the uninsured.",

However, the federal government currently does not provide any financial assistance to states to pay for the care of these individuals through such programs as Medicaid or SCHIP.

    "text": "Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Doc. My regard for you and for all of the Members is, of course, something that, I trust, is understood by all. I see my good friend Don Young there as well.Mr. Speaker, this bill is an enabling bill. It establishes a process. The core of this bill assures that a Native Hawaiian Government has the same powers and sovereign immunity as other native governments, and this is consistent with the history of the legal discussions and court cases that have taken place over such a long period of time. Since the passage of the bill in the Resources Committee, we have had 2 months of discussions with the Hawaii State Attorney General. As a result, we have made numerous changes in the substitute amendment, and have added several pages of new text to make the State more comfortable with how a native government interacts with the State government.This is, in fact, my amendment, and I wanted to assure the minority on the floor--I don't think there is a minority here. Doc is quite right. It's not a question of Republican versus Democrat or majority versus minority. It is a question of perspective as to what is appropriate with regard to Native Hawaiians and other native people and how they establish relationships both with local governments and State governments in the United States of America.So this has not been something behind closed doors. Quite the opposite. It has been a full and complete discussion with the Governor and with the Attorney General, and I think that is reflected in the Governor's statement.In conversation with Governor Lingle today, we concluded that we would agree to disagree. As Representative Hastings has indicated, she continues to support the legislative object of the bill, and I want to assure the House that her administration will not be disadvantaged in any way in any negotiations undertaken upon the passage and signing of this bill.As a candidate for Governor myself, I am completely comfortable with the language of the substitute, and believe that no Governor, regardless of who it may be, will be disadvantaged. The substitute amendment treats a Native Hawaiian entity as any other native government, and it follows literally centuries of existing Native American law.Native Hawaiians are not a race. They are a native indigenous people of the United States. The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that legislation enacted to address the special concerns and conditions of native people of the United States does not constitute discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity. The sovereign status of Indian tribes, recognized by the Constitution, was later extended to Alaska natives as indigenous people, and Representative Young can attest to that in his remarks. On this same basis then, Congress has enacted legislation on multiple occasions for the aboriginal, indigenous people of Hawaii.Absent the substitute, H.R. 2314 would unduly limit the power of the Native Hawaiian governing entity, upon recognition, to accomplish the ordinary and customary activities of any other native organization, such as providing for the welfare of their children or for the health care of its members. The substitute amendment then will ensure that the Native Hawaiian governing entity will have the same powers and authorities that other tribal governments exercise today.The Native Hawaiian Government will have sovereign immunity, as I indicated, the same as other native governments--no more, no less. This is not a new provision. Under the bill passed by the House in the last Congress, the Native Hawaiian governing entity would also have had sovereign immunity once it had been federally recognized.In support of this bill are the Congressional Delegation of Hawaii, the National Congress of American Indians, the Alaska Federation of Natives, et cetera, et cetera. The Native American Caucus, under Representatives Kildee and Cole, as caucus Chairs, are supportive as are the Native Hawaiian organizations, such as the Sovereign Council of Hawaiian Homestead Organizations, the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. Local political leaders in both houses of the legislature and numerous resolutions from both of those bodies are in support.",

National Congress ofDear Honorable Members: The National Congress of American Indians fully supports the Native Hawaiian people in their quest for self-determination and self-governance, and has for many years. (See NCAI Resolution PHX-03-004.) This week, the Native Hawaiian Reorganization Act of 2009 (H.R. 2314) is expected to be amended on the floor of the House of Representatives and subsequently passed through Congress. NCAI supports the amendment as a way to ensure that Congress has a strong basis for treating Native Hawaiians as a distinct native community, and that the Act is constitutionally sound. Through the deliberative process with the Department of Justice, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and with legal scholars with expertise in federal Indian policy, Representative Abercrombie's amendment has addressed these concerns. NCAI has demonstrated repeated commitment to Native Hawaiian self-governance and sovereignty. Over the past ten years, we have passed resolutions and steadfastly supported legislation encouraging the formation of a Native Hawaiian governing entity. NCAI supports Representative Abercrombie's proposed amendment to grant Native Hawaiians the self- determination and self-government they justly deserve.

Known as an astute businessman in the world of finance, Mr. Miller is president and CEO the Delta Funding Corp., a company dealing primarily with the origination, purchase, and servicing of nonconforming residential mortgage loans. Indeed, the industry has looked to Mr. Miller for leadership, and he has served in that capacity as a representative of the National Home Equity Mortgage Association, National Mortgage Brokers Association, Executive Enterprises, American Community Bankers, Information Management Network, and Mortgage Bankers Association of America.Yet despite the ongoing demands on his time and talents, Hugh Miller has vigorously and effectively undertaken a myriad of social responsibilities. Many diverse organizations including the National Kidney Foundation, Police Conference of New York and Nassau County, DARE, the American Cancer Society, the Leukemia Society of America, Hofstra University Scholarship Funds, and the Huntington's Disease Society of America have greatly benefited from his service. His experience in this regard has emerged as a yardstick by which all such future dedication is measured. Furthermore, in conjunction with the Interfaith Nutritional Network, Delta Funding has created the Delta Funding Inn, which caters to the needs of disadvantaged youths.Mr. Speaker, in a time when we search for heroes and leaders, it is most reassuring to know that people such as Hugh Miller are tirelessly striving for the betterment of society.

    "title": "CONDEMN BOMBINGS IN ISRAEL",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in stong support of House Concurrent Resolution 149, which condemns the bombings in Israel, and in solidarity with the people and Government of Israel. This recent spate of bombings was a series of heinous and cowardly acts, perpetrated by elements of the Palestinian society that have been rejected by the majority of Palestinians, and completely reviled by the international community.During this period of grief and mourning by Israelis and Jews the world over, I am pleased to see that we can all come together like this, in bipartisan fashion, to speak against these acts of evil, and support the Israeli people in their efforts to combat terrorism. However, we are faced with a complex question: How can we best combat the evil of terrorism, as it continues to indiscriminately victimize the people of Israel? I think the appropriate follow-up to that would be: How do we then fight this evil effectively, without completely derailing the peace process? That to me is a quandary, but it's one that I think is not completely unsolvable.In fact, I think we've seen some recent steps that would lead us to believe that we're in the best position, since the beginning of the process, to resolve this human tragedy of gigantic proportions. It has finally become apparent to the international community that we are all linked in a common struggle; a struggle to eradicate terror from the face of this planet. Without a doubt, we all have a vested interest in fighting the spread of terrorism, and that is why I welcomed last week's Summit of Peacemakers in Cairo as a positive step in that direction.The importance of forging as broad a coalition as possible to repel these enemies of peace can not be emphasized enough. It no longer suffices to have world condemnation, we must have world action as well. We have avoided this issue long enough; and in our interdependent and inextricably linked international community, we can no longer afford to do so. However, we must also take careful note: we are not attacking Islam, or the Moslem community--we are attacking terrorism, and terrorism has no religion. We are, in sum, fighting against the enemies of peace, and that fight transcends all ethnic and national borders.We have all, in effect, partaken in a momentous and irreversible process. We can not be deterred from continuing on. As Hasan Abd Al-Rahman, chief representative of the Palestinian Authority in Washington, said in a statement to a recent International Relations Committee hearing on the commitments made by the Palestinians to the peace process: ``It's the struggle between those who have placed their lot with peace and those who seek its death.'' Therefore, I urge all my colleagues to continue to work together, to be vigilant, and to have faith that we can overcome these recent tragedies. Otherwise, the dark forces poised against us can claim their greatest victory.",

    "title": "INDIAN AMERICANS DOMINATE U.S. HOTEL INDUSTRY",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I call to the attention of my colleagues an article entitled ``Hospitality is Their Business, Indian-Americans' Rooms-to-Riches Success Story.'' This article appeared in the business section of today's New York Times.Mr. Speaker, as this article correctly points out, Indian Americans are now the dominant force in the domestic hotel industry. Today, Indian Americans own 12,000 hotel and motel properties. This translates into 46 percent of America's economy hotels and 26 percent of the United States total lodging. This is truly an amazing and impressive accomplishment.Mr. Speaker, Congress is in the midst of a long and protracted debate on how to reform our Nation's immigration laws. Many of my colleagues have endorsed the idea of sharply reducing the number of legal immigrants to this country as part of this overhaul of our immigration policies. I believe that any Member who reads this article will have to seriously question and ultimately reject that proposal. We are a nation of immigrants. Immigrants have built this country into the economic powerhouse of the Western World. Indian Americans are one of our country's most visible success stories. As Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at Pepperdine University, stated in the article, ``These Indians are modern Horatio Algers.''Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to closely review this important article. I know my colleagues join me in saluting the Indian American community on its speculator success in the hotel industry. We need more entrepreneurs such as the Indian Americans described in this article who are willing to become self-sufficient, productive, and profitable members of our society.In the quarter-century that people of Indian ancestry have been emigrating to the United States in sizable numbers, they have carved out a steadily bigger share of the nation's hotel industry. Starting with no-name motels, they soon graduated to Days Inn, Econo Lodge, Rodeway and other economy franchises. Today, with more than 12,000 properties, Indian-Americans own 46 percent of America's economy hotels and 26 percent of the nation's total 45,000 lodgings. ``We used to be isolated in a few states in the South,'' said Ravi Patel, whose Charlotte, N.C., company, Sree Inc., owns 20 hotels. ``Now we're almost everywhere.'' They are also moving up. A new generation is buying properties like Sheratons, Radissons and Hiltons, adding an upscale chapter to an immigrant success story. The first wave of motel ownership was propelled by the Indian-Americans' strong family ties, close-knit communities and a willingness to invest years of sweat. This latest wave represents a break with tradition and a willingness to tackle bigger, more complex challenges. But the original community still provides the backing, as today's entrepreneurs pool the resources of extended families and borrow from fellow Indian- Americans, for whom a handshake is often sufficient collateral. ``These Indians are modern Horatio Algers,'' said Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at the Pepperdine University Institute for Public Policy in Malibu, Calif. ``They're willing to start in marginal and sometimes risky areas that native-born Americans are not interested in going into, and working incredibly long hours.'' Ramesh Gokal, who bought a 26-room hotel in North Carolina soon after coming to the United States in 1976, is now president of Knights Inn, a chain of about 180 franchised economy hotels. Children of the industry pioneers are establishing their own companies and using newly acquired knowledge of capital markets to build budding empires. ``My parents' generation did business by having x dollars, buying y goods and selling for z,'' said Karim Alibhai, the kinetic 32-year-old president and chief executive of Gencom American Hospitality, a family-owned hotel group in Houston. ``At the roadside hotels they ran, the management philosophy was get guests in and out, and have the maids clean the rooms.'' But these days, ``you have to know administration, management and how to use Wall Street to invest and to grow,'' added Mr. Alibhai, who was born in Kenya and majored in economics at Rice University. (Many Indian-American hotelkeepers came to America by way of Africa, where their families had lived for several generations in many cases.) In Mr. Alibhai's case, the big plans are not just talk. In September, he co-sponsored a $350 million initial public offering of a real estate investment trust, one of the largest in United States history. Paine Webber was the lead investment banker and Mr. Alibhai was initially the biggest individual shareholder. Today Gencom affiliates, which began with a single Best Western that Mr. Alibhai's parents bought in 1979 after emigrating from Kenya, own all or part of 47 hotels in 13 states. Properties include the 759-room Radisson New Orleans, the 650-room Sheraton Astrodome in Houston as well as Marriotts, Hiltons and boutique hotels in Boston and San Antonio. Revenues are expected to exceed $200 million this year. Like his parents, Mr. Alibhai said, he ``worked the desk, drove the shuttle van to the airport and learned to fix the sewer plant.'' In the three years after finishing college in 1984, years in which the Houston hotel industry bled red ink, he still did odd jobs at the hotel, but spent most of his time learning the business. ``Operating during that recession was my M.B.A.,'' said Mr. Alibhai, a trim, tennis-playing executive whose office is in a sleek Houston high-rise. In 1987, with the economy looking up but hotel values still down, Mr. Alibhai began buying distressed properties, often jointly with other Indian- Americans. ``That's when the real learning process began,'' he said, ``not just acquiring the properties but convincing lenders who had tightened their purse strings to finance me. I had to change their perception of Indians as being identified with low-end hotels.'' In many ways, Mr. Alibhai's world of revenue streams, variable inflation rates for assessing potential purchases and structuring deals with investment bankers is alien to the generation of his 60-year-old father, Akber, who is in charge of purchasing for Gencom. ``The older generation is still very cautious about sharing information, like the cost of hotels,'' said Jay Patel of Colorado Springs, a 43-year-old native of Zimbabwe who is part owner of seven hotels in Colorado and California. ``The younger generation is much more forthcoming.'' There are other differences. ``When you come from India and Africa, your view of labor is very different,'' Mr. Alibhai said. ``People are thankful just to have a job. That's their bonus. Here, employees also want to feel appreciated. I prefer this system.'' Most of Gencom's corporate employees are given stock or bonuses, he said. In the early years, Indian-Americans had problems typical of many newcomers in trying to get financing and insurance. By their account, insurers in the early 1980's suddenly canceled property insurance to all Indian hotel owners, believing them to be part of an Indian conspiracy to buy properties and burn them down to collect insurance money. ``We were turned down by about 200 insurance companies, until we convinced underwriters that these immigrants were outstanding risks,'' said Ron Thomas, a vice president of United Insurance Agencies in Muncie, Ind., who is widely admired by Indian hotel owners for his early efforts on their behalf. Discrimination also took other forms, including boasts by rivals that their properties were ``American owned.'' Much of the more blatant bias began to wane with the formation of an Indian hotel owners' association in 1989, vigorously supported by Henry R. Silverman, the chairman of HFS Inc., and Michael A. Leven, then president of Days Inn. Starting with about 100 members, the group now numbers more than 4,000 hotel-keepers. ``Indian franchisees have been the engine of growth for the entire economy-hotel sector,'' said Mr. Silverman, whose company's franchises include Days Inn, Knights Inn and Super 8. ``They were willing to build with their own capital when no one else was willing to.'' For all their success, though, Indian-Americans have stayed away from luxury hotels and five-star resorts, and often from full-service hotels, mainly because of their cost but also for cultural and religious reasons. ``Most Indian hotel owners here are Hindus from Gujarat state and don't do well with anything involving alcohol and meat,'' said Mr. Patel of Colorado Springs. (Most Hindus from the western state of Gujarat are vegetarians, according to the Indian Embassy in Washington, and most Gujarati women do not drink.) But younger Indians feel differently. ``They realize you can offer meat and alcohol to your guests, because it's all part of the hotel business,'' Mr. Patel added. ``Within the next five years you'll see a lot of us owning luxury properties, like Ritz-Carltons,'' said Tushar Patel, the 31-year-old president of Tarsadia Hotels in Costa Mesa, Calif. About half of Tarsadia's 13 properties--including the 440-room Clarion Hotel at the San Francisco airport--are full-service hotels, with restaurants and bars. Tushar Patel, by the way, is not related to Jay Patel of Colorado Springs, unless distantly, or to most of the thousands of other Patels who own hotels in the United States. Almost all Patels, even those from Africa, trace their ancestry to Gujarat, where hospitality is highly regarded. In the United States, many Indian immigrants turned to lodging because they could buy cheap motels, they could live rent free and the family could work the front desk, clean rooms, do laundry and make repairs. When they stepped up to franchised properties, for as little as $20,000 plus 8 percent of revenues, the Indians acquired not only toll-free reservation systems and the benefit of bulk purchases, but an education about prices, payrolls and bookkeeping. ``We'll soon have eight hotels and we're looking to open a 200-room one soon, and it's no big deal,'' said S. Jay (you guessed it) Patel of Alpharetta, GA. ``Now we're experienced enough to know we can handle it.'' His father, J.K. Patel, left a 10-year career with Barclays Bank in Kenya to come to America in 1978, spending six months looking for a business before buying a hotel in South Carolina. The elder Mr. Patel attributes the Indians' success in this country to ``the way we were brought up.'' Parents instilled the need for education and trust between families and among their own ethnic group. ``In January I did a deal with an Indian partner in Dallas for two hotels,'' said Mr. Alibhai of Gencom. ``We shook hands, and before the contracts were signed I wired him several million dollars.'' Arvind Patel, who with his wife, Bhavna, owns a 39-room Days Inn in West Point, Miss., cites another factor--the willingness of extended families and acquaintances to provide financial help. ``We work together as a team,'' said Arvind Patel, a native of Tanzania. ``A lot of families give you $10,000, even $30,000, without charging you interest and without any collateral. They figure one day you may help them.'' But like many Indians, these Patels are branching out and moving up, building an 81-room Wingate Inn and a 58-room Hampton Inn elsewhere in Mississippi. Meantime, both continue working a full shift each day behind the desk of their Days Inn, with their 12-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter pitching in on weekends. ``And if our help doesn't show up,'' Mrs. Patel said, ``my husband and I still clean the rooms.'' Many of the older Indian-Owned motels were long ago refurbished, if only to measure up as franchises--a method the Indians quickly saw as a route to financial independence. Some properties have been kept for the next generation, but most have been sold to a newer wave of Indian immigrants. When Indian-Americans graduate from college, many have chosen to become doctors, engineers, lawyers and accountants. ``But in most families at least one son or daughter will become hoteliers, because they realize it isn't the hard work it was for us,'' said J.K. Patel, the former Barclays banker. ``The difference is, we used to man the desk ourselves. The new generation likes sitting in the office and delegating the work.''",

I find that difficult to believe.Mr. Speaker, when President Bush banned the importation of assault weapons in 1989, the number of such rifles traced to crime dropped by 45 percent.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with my colleagues and the members of Temple Emanuel of Great Neck, as they gather on May 5, 1996, in Temple Emanual to celebrate Emanuel Day, the end of a 10-year effort that has served to beautify the synagogue, and enhance it as an ongoing source of inspiration to its congregants and the Great Neck community. Conceived by Rabbi Robert Widom, spiritual leader of Temple Israel, the project evolved into the design of six stained glass windows for the synagogue's sanctuary, a new ark and eternal light. The initial project, under the direction of Rabbi Widom, undertook a search that would last for 10 years until the appropriate artist was selected and the creative plans were developed.An extensive search by the rabbi and the congregation's refurbishing committee yielded Paul Winthrop Wood, a Canadian born artist, who comes from a family of renowned architects and builders. Mr. Wood brought to Temple Emanuel an innate understanding of the Old Testament and the many creative and imaginative themes that flow from it. It was his early upbringing by his mother that endowed him with a rich blend of talent and insight that would be brought to fruition by the many religious building challenges he undertook.A native of Port Washington, Mr. Wood continues the family tradition of building and design. He began his early studies in the Art Studies League and the National Academy of Design. Soon thereafter, he founded his own school, and began a career that would include the design and construction of more than 100 churches and synagogues throughout the United States and 30 houses of worship on Long Island.In rising to the challenge of bringing to the synagogue and sense of love, understanding, and compassion, Mr. Wood succeeded grandly. It is with great pride and love that the trustees of Temple Emanuel of Great Neck have declared Sunday, May 5, as Emanuel Day. As the hundreds of congregants of Temple Emanuel gather on this day, it is most exciting and reaffirming that in the truest tradition of the American spirit, this beautiful congregation continues to so willingly give of itself, to its members and the community.",

Recognizing the importance of technological development in Israel's future, Ros and Joe have been long time supporters of Technion, Israel's only comprehensive scientific university and center for applied research. In this vein, they have provided funding for Technion's Gurwin-I Tech-Sat satellite, a project stimulating telecommunications, meteorology and x-ray telescope technology, as well as serving as a key link in an Israeli-based computer network.However, Mr. Speaker, Ros and Joe's philanthropic efforts extend far beyond Technion to encompass the entire New York metropolitan community. The Long Island Jewish Medical Center and UJA-Federation have benefitted greatly due to their continuing support. Furthermore, Ros and Joe's commitment to the elderly has led to the construction of the Gurwin Jewish Geriatric Center in Commack, Long Island.Mr. Speaker, the Gurwins have come to symbolize the American spirit of volunteerism and generosity.

The Memorial Association recognizes individuals who pay tribute to educational and social projects that express the lifelong philosophy and personal commitments of Harry Van Arsdale, Jr., the long time, and much beloved labor leader.Throughout his life, Joe Jacobson has strived to help others. In 1921, Mr. Jacobson was initiated into the Local 3, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. From there he held a position on the Board of Directors of the Electrical Workers Benefit Society. He has served as president to the Electrical Welfare Club, and the Bronx Acorn Social Club. Mr. Jacobson was also a representative of Local 3, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and an employee representative of the Joint Industry Board of the Electrical Industry, and of the vacation committee.While becoming active in the community, he still remained a loving husband to his late wife Rose, and a father to his son Stanley, who has blessed the Jacobsons with three grandchildren and one great-grandson.This is not the first time Mr. Jacobson has been honored with such prestigious recognition. Mr. Jacobson's accomplishments were also acknowledged by the Electrical Industry Division of the State of Israel Bonds, the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of the Electrical Sign Division, and the United Jewish Appeal and the Bronx Council of Scouting.The dedication of this man to better his community continued even after his retirement on March 1, 1967. He was instrumental in organizing the thirteen chapters of the Retirees Association of Local 3, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. He served as their first treasurer in 1969, and has served as president since 1975, while continuing to remain a board member on the National Council of Senior Citizens. He still remains active in his community, always putting others before himself. There is no doubt in my mind that this country would benefit by having more people like Joseph Jacobson.Mr. Speaker, it is with the utmost sincerity and gratitude, that I pay tribute to this man, and thank him for the generosity he has proffered on others throughout his life. He is an outstanding citizen and an inspiration to us all. Therefore, I ask my colleagues to rise with me, and the people of the Fifth Congressional District, as we extend to Joseph Jacobson our sincere appreciation for his life's work and dedication to others.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today so that this body may take note of a very special organization in my district--the Queens Borough Public Library. This organization celebrates the anniversary of its founding this year. I wish to congratulate them and offer my voice in support of their tireless efforts to educate and serve the residents of Queens Borough.As I have told many of you before, Queens is a very special place to me and to those who live there. Its nearly two million residents make up the most ethnically diverse community in the United States. For years, the face of Queens has been the face of the many cultures of the world.In that vein, the Queens Library system reaches out to this microcosm of the American mosaic and provides not just books, but citizenship education classes, English as a second language [ESL] classes, job training, and access to the information superhighway. In fact, the Queens Library offers over 18,000 programs to the community at large. Sixty-three facilities scattered throughout the borough are wellsprings of learning from which the community benefits.On top of all this, the Queens Library is adding an international resource center [IRC] to the redesigned Flushing Branch, which will enable it to showcase many of the cultures reflected in the borough population. Using the latest technology, this unique facility will provide cultural background, business information, and educational materials on the varied peoples of the world.With its expanded facilities, the Queens Library will be able to host even more high quality exhibitions. For example, last year, it presented an excellent exhibit with support from the National Endowment for the Humanities [NEH] on Lewis Latimer, a 19th-century inventor, and on Korean-style printing with movable metal type--a technique perfected in Asia well before Gutenberg and his printing press. Many of my colleagues know that I have had a longstanding interest in the Asian region, and therefore, I am delighted Queens is becoming an increasingly recognized center of Asian commerce in the United States. I wholeheartedly applaud the Queens Library for its diligent efforts and foresight in this regard.For a hundred years, the Queens Library has nurtured the community, supplying its needs for information and community services. As it heads into its next hundred years, I wish them the best, and look forward to the new developments it will surely bring.",

    "title": "HONORING AMERICAN WORKING MEN AND WOMEN",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today, to commemorate our Nation's Labor Day holiday, and to honor New York's vibrant and diverse work force. Appropriately enough, before Congress adjourns, we will have passed a bill to raise the minimum wage and sent it to the President for his signature. This marks a tremendous victory for those people who have been working tirelessly to ensure that this vital, and long overdue, action be taken. Many people deserve praise for their work on this and other issues, but I would especially like to recognize the New York State AFL-CIO, the Long Island Central Labor Council, the New York Central Labor Council, and the Building and Construction Trades Union of the AFL-CIO, as well as all of you in the labor community who have united to work together against the antilabor sentiment that has pervaded Congress in the last 18 months. Your immeasurable support in this effort has assisted Congress in finally, after 7 years, passing a much-needed raise in our Nation's minimum wage, as well as staving off several vitriolic attacks on our Nation's workers.In a short time, those workers who have been scraping by on $4.25 an hour will get some relief for their families by earning a little bit more. Right now, the minimum wage is at 40-year low in terms of purchasing power. The simple fact is that people can no longer raise a family on this kind of wage. Yes, it's a small step, but it's no secret that it's a step that most Americans have desired for a long time. In fact, 80 percent of the American public supports this raise. Additionally, this legislation is the essence of family values--in other words, by enacting this measure, we are truly valuing our families. In my view, it is a simple matter. If we don't assist, nurture, and encourage our families to attain a higher standard of living, how do we expect America as a whole to succeed?Howeer, this labor-unfriendly majority has, for some time now, been a virtual roadblock in the way of achieving meaningful legislation such as this, as well as other important labor and family related matters. We need to continue to be in the business of improving, not undercutting, the well being, and survival, of our families. Nonetheless, whether its been in the form of striker-replacement legislation, allowing companies to raid the pensions of its workers, crafting a bill to mandate employer-led organizations to address labor issues, or cutting funding for important agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA] and the National Labor Relations Board [NLRB], the Republican leadership has strived to make it more difficult for American workers to have access to safety and security in their jobs. These actions do not send the right message to hardworking Americans, and I intend to ensure that trend is reversed.Lastly, through the persistent efforts of those such as my colleague Senator Ted Kennedy, we are also able to pass a serious first step toward meaningful health insurance reform. This bill will affect at least 25 million Americans who either change or lose their jobs, or have preexisting conditions in their family that has, up until now, given insurance companies an excuse not to offer comprehensive health insurance. That is patently unfair and just plain wrong, and I have consistently made sure that these concerns are addressed properly.Working men and women have been the glue of this country ever since its inception, and I heartily salute them on Labor Day 1996. I strongly urge my colleagues to commemorate with me the workers of New York and their families on this day, and I look forward to a time when all Americans can feel safe in their jobs and financially secure in their lives.",

In both of these areas, he was enormously successful.Ambassador Ray and his embassy effectively publicized the importance of the Indian market to American business. It was during Ambassador Ray's tenure that the United States Secretary of Commerce led a high level business delegation to India.Ambassador Ray was equally effective in helping to curtail the South Asian arms race by effectively arguing against the administration's plan to transfer advanced fighter aircraft to Pakistan.Siddhartha and his delightful wife Maya were an extraordinary team in Washington. They came to this post after distinguished careers in law and government. Siddhartha came to understand the workings of the U.S. Congress as only a former Member of Parliament could.I join my colleagues in wishing Siddhartha and Maya Ray the very best of luck in their future endeavors, and we hope to see them back in Washington often.",

He, like many other courageous young soldiers, landed on Omaha Beach in Normandy, France on D-day, June 6, 1944. Five campaigns later, the war ended for him just outside of Berlin, Germany and 1 year later was discharged from military service.After the war, he settled in Suffolk County, and began working at the Kings Park State Hospital in charge of 85 patients during the evening shift. It was here that he began his efforts to improve the quality of life of the patients and the employees. He effected such changes as improved patient-staff ratio, upward mobility through career ladders, and a higher level of training opportunities. In 1975, Greg founded the Kings Park Employees Federal Credit Union and served as the union's president until 1996.Throughout his career, he formed many civic groups and became extremely active in local civic affairs. His involvement with the union as an advocate and organizer led him to many positions on the local, regional, and statewide levels where he could continue to work for the good of all.Since his retirement in 1988, Greg has continued to stay fully involved in civic affairs. He serves as the facilitator for the Northwest Civic Coalition and the Suffolk Community Alliance, whose membership includes all the major civic coalitions in Suffolk County.Greg is truly one of Kings Park's treasures and has been a driving force in ensuring that Kings Park is a better place to live in.I ask my colleagues to join with me in saluting Gregory Szurnicki who has provided a lifetime of service to his country and his community, and in congratulating him on being named the 1996 Man of the Year by the Kings Park Chamber of Commerce.",

    "title": "NAZI SS MEMBERS IN THE UNITED STATES",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring a very serious and troubling affair to the attention of my colleagues. Several news reports, over the last couple of days, have uncovered an incredible story: The German Government is giving pensions to over 3,000 former members of the Nazi Waffen SS Corps, living in the United States. Not extraordinary in and of itself, because these men receive their pensions as a result of their military service during World War II, yet the question that begs answering is: How many of these individuals might be war criminals? The outrage in this matter, is that the German Government may never have bothered to check.At this same time, there are many Holocaust survivors--Catholics, Jews, and others living in the United States and elsewhere in the world--who have received very little in the way of compensation, and even scores of surviving victims who do not receive anything from the German Government. After the horrors and suffering they were forced to endure during the war, how can we allow this additional measure of indignation?Apparently, many of these former SS members were able to enter the United States, and eventually gain citizenship, by falsifying their identities and lying about their wartime activities. Many of them, however, have been living in the United States for years now, some boldly with the same names, the same identities, the same blood on their hands.Mr. Speaker, there is no excuse for that, and it is simply unacceptable. Yesterday, I sent letters to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President Clinton, and Attorney General Janet Reno, asking that they obtain the names of these Nazi pensioners, and release them to the proper American Government agencies, in order to fully investigate the possibility of war criminals in our midst. There must be a full accounting. Yes, many of them are old, frail men, who have lived peacefully in their respective neighborhoods for decades. Did they show the same respect for the millions in Europe who also were old, frail, and living their lives peacefully? I think we all know the answer to that question.Thanks to the hard work of the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations, as well as some other prominent organizations, we are beginning to uncover a trail of Nazi war criminals among us. In fact, the OSI is finding and prosecuting Nazis at the rate of one per month. It is imperative therefore, that we have all the necessary information at our disposal, so that we can continue to bring these murderers to justice. They have eluded the authorities, and the moral outrage of their deeds, for over 50 years now, but we will no longer allow that to continue. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in this endeavor, so that we may finally honor the memories of the Nazis' victims. Everyday, more and more Holocaust survivors leave this Earth, while their former tormentors continue to live on, having never been held accountable for the horrible deeds of the past. It's simply time to act now. Therefore, I call on the Government of Germany to work with us in addressing and resolving this issue once and for all--for the survivors, for the victims, and for the future. They need to do the right thing.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against religious intolerance in Pakistan. Earlier this month, tens of thousands of Muslims angered by the alleged desecration of a Koran, and incited by local Muslim leaders, burned thousands of homes of Christian villagers, along with a hospital, a school, a Catholic church, and a dormitory. While this event by itself is despicable, the conduct of the local police in this affair is unforgivable. According to reports, local police actually told residents to leave their homes because they could not protect them from the mobs. Yet it took only a small army unit to halt the rampage, which destroyed shops and homes, and restore order to the village.This is only the latest incident in what the Christian Voice of Pakistan reports is ongoing persecution of Christians by Muslims in Pakistan. The State Department's ``Human Rights Report on Pakistan'' points out that ``Discriminatory religious legislation has encouraged an atmosphere of religious intolerance.'' In fact, section 295(c) of the Penal Code stipulates the death penalty for blaspheming the Prophet Mohammed. This provision has been used by Muslims to intimidate religious minorities in Pakistan.I met yesterday with the Pakistani Charge d'Affaires to ask the Pakistani Government to launch an immediate investigation of the incident with particular emphasis on the role of the local police, and to repeal those portions of the Penal Code which give license to Muslims to persecute Christians and other religious minorities.Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in calling on Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to speak out against religious discrimination and to work to create a climate of tolerance and religious harmony in Pakistan.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that, despite the hectic and trend-setting legislative pace, we have found the time today to take up House Concurrent Resolution 17 to congratulate the people of Guatemala on the establishment of the peace process for that nation.After 36 years of civil war, Guatemala has finally had a chance for a lasting peace. The URNG has agreed to demobilize and in fact the first URNG combatants are entering demobilization camps this week. The Guatemalan military has agreed to reduce its size by one-third, and the United States has pledged $265 million over 4 years for reconstruction.Even before the signing of the peace accords, the human rights situation in Guatemala had improved dramatically as a result of the cessation of hostilities last March. The government of President Arzu has moved aggressively to restructure the military command by reducing the number of general officers from 23 to 8 and removing those officers alleged to be involved in corruption or other abuses. But there is still a long way to go.Guatemala continues to suffer from a marked disparity in income distribution, and poverty is pervasive. According to AID, 75 percent of Guatemala's population live in poverty. Only 48 percent of its adults are literate, and its infant mortality rate is among the highest in Latin America.Yet despite of all this, or perhaps because of it, Guatemalans have chosen peace and democracy. They are to be congratulated for that choice.Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my colleague and chairman [Mr. Gallegly] for his great leadership in this area and for introducing this resolution, to our chairman [Mr. Gilman] for his stewardship, and for our ranking member [Mr. Hamilton] for his hard work on this resolution.

With 3 years of economic growth, peace, and stability, the people of Nicaragua chose a candidate who emphasized economic reform and private sector-led growth as key planks in his platform. Nevertheless, President Aleman has his work cut out for him.Nicaragua continues to have a precarious balance-of-payment position and is heavily dependent upon foreign assistance. Although the economy has grown recently, the country remains very poor, with a per capita income of $470 per year.Strengthening the rule of law was a campaign theme of the President, and he inherits a court system that has become a bottleneck as problems of crime and property disputes have proliferated. It is imperative for Nicaragua to address this question if foreign investors are to have any confidence in Nicaragua's future.The United States and other donors have provided $4 billion to Nicaragua since 1990, and for the coming fiscal year USAID has requested an additional $22 million to deepen and expand the economic reforms and enhance the legitimacy of civil institutions.The international community must continue to work with the Nicaraguans to help them along the path to prosperity. I believe, Mr. Speaker, that this resolution will provide a measure of moral support to Nicaraguans and encourage them to continue on the road that they have chosen.Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate my colleague from New York [Mr. Houghton] for sponsoring this resolution and his hard work and diligence in this area of the world; and also the gentleman from California [Mr. Gallegly], our chairman on the subcommittee, for putting this legislation through our body; as well as the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman], the chairman of the full committee; and the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Hamilton], who serves as our leader on this side.I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.",

Born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, Julia and Buddy Farrell were married at the church they had both grown up attending, Nativity Church, on June 7, 1947. On this Saturday, April 12, over 125 of their friends and family will honor them at a surprise party to celebrate their anniversary.Before marrying Julia, Buddy proudly served his country in the U.S. Marines. Shortly after their marriage, they moved to Queens, NY, where they raised their five children, Terri, Joan, Kathy, John, and Timmy. In 1964, their niece, Noreen, from County Kerry, Ireland, joined their family here in America.Julia and Buddy were very active in St. Nicholas of Tolentine parish. Julia headed the ``milk mothers,'' organized the majorettes, helped with the sports association, and volunteered in the gym. Buddy, who worked as a police officer with the New York City Police Department, also was involved in the Holy Name Society and the homeless shelter. Julia and Buddy are known to everyone for their giving natures and always reaching out to help their friends and family.After working very hard and raising a wonderful family, they are living the good life in retirement in the condo in Leisure Village in Ridge, NY. Julia and Buddy are very proud of their children and adore their 12 grandchildren, Tricia, Maryellen, Danny, Kevin, John, Bridget, Casey, Erin, Matthew, Colin, Elizabeth, and Christopher, who range in age from 4 months to 25 years old. Julia and Buddy enjoy the company of many friends, playing golf, and swimming. In the winter, they go south to Florida, and in the summer, they spend time in Brant Lake, NY.Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to rise with me today in honoring Julia and Buddy Farrell on 50 years of marriage, and in wishing them many more years of happiness together.",

I raise the question, who is being protected by this law, convicted felons, or law abiding citizens?Each year since fiscal year 1993 we in Congress have stopped funding this guns for convicted felons program. However, this is insufficient, because as the law is still on the books, even unfunded, felons can go to court and regain their firearm privileges.To stop this from happening, we should eliminate the guns for convicted felons program outright.Today, along with the gentlewoman from Maryland [Mrs. Morella] and the gentlewoman from New York [Mrs. McCarthy], I am introducing the Stop Arming Felons Act, or the SAFE Act. The Ackerman-Morella-McCarthy legislation will eliminate guns for convicted felons altogether. It sends a clear message that we should make it harder, not easier, for criminals to have access to weapons.The Stop Arming Felons Act is bipartisan and has 32 original cosponsors, and I urge all of my colleagues to act in the interest of this country and let us stop arming convicted felons.",

    "title": "PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 54, PROHIBITING THE PHYSICAL DESECRATION OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, our Founding Fathers must be very puzzled looking down on us today; and instead of seeing us dealing with the very real challenges that face our Nation, they see us laboring under this great compulsion to amend the document that underpins our democracy and trying to give this Congress a great new power at the expense of the people, the power for the first time to stifle dissent. The threat must be great, they must be saying, to justify changing the Bill of Rights for the first time and decreasing, rather than increasing, the rights of the people.And what is the threat? Is our democracy at risk? What is the crisis in the Republic? What is the challenge to our way of life? Where is our belief system threatened? Are people jumping from behind parked cars waving burning flags at us trying to prevent us from going to work? Trying to grind America to a halt? Do we really believe that we are under such a siege because of a few loose cannons? Need we change the Constitution to save our democracy?The real threat is not the occasional burning of a flag but the permanent banning of the burners. The real threat is that some of us have now mistaken the flag for a religious icon to be worshipped rather than the symbol of our freedom that is to be cherished. Rather than allowing someone to insult them by demeaning the flag, they would diminish our Constitution.These rare but vile acts of desecration that have been cited by those who propose changing our founding document do not threaten anybody. If a jerk burns a flag, America is not threatened, democracy is not under siege, freedom is not at risk and we are not threatened, my colleagues; we are offended. And to change the Constitution because someone offends us is in itself unconscionable.The Nazis, Mr. Speaker, the Nazis and fascists and the imperial Japanese army combined, could not diminish the rights of even one single American; and yet in an act of cowardice, Mr. Speaker, we are about to do what they could not.Where are the patriots? What ever happened to fighting to the death for somebody's right to disagree? We now choose instead to react by taking away the right to protest. Even a despicable low-life social malcontent has a right to disagree, and he has a right to disagree in an obnoxious fashion if he wishes. That is the test of free expression, and we are about to fail that test.Real patriots choose freedom over symbolism. That is the ultimate contest between substance and form. Why does the flag need protecting? Burning one flag or burning a thousand flags does not destroy it. It is a symbol. But change one word of our living Constitution of this great Nation, and it and we will never be the same. We cannot destroy a symbol. Yes, people burn the flag, but, Mr. Speaker, there it is again, right in back. It goes on. It cannot be destroyed. It represents our beliefs.Now, poets and patriots will tell us that men have died for the flag. But that language itself is symbolic. People do not die for symbols. They fight and they die for freedom. They fight and they die for democracy. They fight and they die for values. To fight and die for the flag means to fight and die for the cause.Let us remind ourselves we did not enter World War II because the Japanese sunk a bunch of our flags. There happened to have been ships filled with men tied to the other end of those flagpoles, and our way of life was threatened.We love and we honor and we respect our flag for what it represents. It is different from all other flags. And I notice we do not make it illegal to burn some other country's flags, and that is because our flag is different. No, it is not different because of its shape; they are all basically the same. And it is not different because of its design; they are all similar. And no, not because of the colors. Many have the same colors. Our flag is unique only because it represents our unique values, it represents tolerance for dissent. This country was founded by dissenters that others found obnoxious.And what is a dissenter? In this case it is a social protestor who feels so strongly about an issue that one would stoop so low as to try to get under our skin and to try to rile us up to prove his point, and have us react by making this great Nation less than it was. And how are we going to react?Dictatorships crack down on people who burn their nation's flags, not democracies. We tolerate dissent and dissenters, even despicable dissenters.What is the flag, the American flag? Yes, it is a piece of cloth. It is red, white, and blue with 50 stars and 13 stripes. But what if we pass this amendment and desecrators make flags with 55 stars and burn them? Will we rush to amend our law again? And if they add a stripe or two and set it ablaze, and it surely looks like our flag, but is it? Do we rush in and count the stripes before determining whether or not we have been constitutionally insulted? And what if the stripes are orange instead of red? What mischief are we doing? If it is a full-size color picture of the flag they burn, is it a crime to desecrate a symbol of a symbol? What are we doing?Our beloved flag represents a great nation, Mr. Speaker. We love our flag because there is a great republic for which it stands made great by a Constitution that we want to protect, a Constitution given to our care by giants and about to be nibbled to death by dwarfs.Mr. Speaker, I call upon the patriots of the House to rise and defend the Constitution, resist the temptation to drape ourselves in the flag and hold sacred the Bill of Rights. Defend our Constitution and defeat this amendment.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with my constituents and the students and faculty of SUNY College at Old Westbury, NY, as they honor Mina Barrett for outstanding professional and public service. Dr. Barrett was born in New York City in 1948 and at a very early age established her academic credentials. She was an honor student at Oceanside High School and received her graduate and undergraduate degrees at the State University of New York at Stony Brook in the field of psychology.In 1975, Dr. Barrett came to SUNY College at Old Westbury and became one of the founders of the Psychology Department. Rising to the position of associate professor, Dr. Barrett immediately became active on a variety of academic committees. Yet to the great benefit of both the academic and general communities of the greater New York metropolitan area, Dr. Barrett embarked upon a course of community service that would serve as a model for effective community activism.Recognized for her deep understanding of the human mind, Dr. Barrett was appointed as a Red Cross Disaster mental health psychologist and became codirector of the Nassau County Chapter of the Red Cross for mental health. It was in 1994 that she was called upon by the city of Los Angeles to serve in an assisting office in the city's tragic earthquake. For her service rendered to the city of Los Angeles she received the Henri Dunant Humanitarian Award. Her services were again utilized by the residents of Long Island in 1994 during the east end fires for which she received a service citation. During the tragic crash of TWA flight 800, she served as coordinator of mental health, rescue and relief working 18 hours a day training and directing health teams.Mr. Speaker, Dr. Barrett's activities in human relations and women's issues have given her an international reputation. I ask my colleagues to join with me and rise to salute Dr. Mina Barrett for her devotion and for all she has done to enhance our world.",

    "title": "COMMENDING ROGER TILLES' LEADERSHIP ON THE NEA",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to commend Mr. Roger Tilles on his insightful and provocative op-ed piece on the National Endowment for the Arts, which was recently published in the New York Times. Mr. Tilles, who is the former President of Temple Beth-el of Great Neck, has worked from the private sector to further the cultural enrichment of the Long Island community. With generous support from the Tilles family, Long Island University created the Tilles Center which has been vital in educating students about the arts, and bringing world class cultural exhibits and performances to Long Island. His following op-ed piece recognizes the unique partnership that exists between the private sector and the NEA. When voting on the NEA, we should look to Mr. Tilles' example, and recognize that public funding for the arts, and private sector philanthropy go hand in hand.As efforts are mounted to scrap the National Endowment for the Arts, there is no small irony that among the reasons why Long Island is now among the top 20 places to live in the nation is its quality of life, best reflected in the broad scope of cultural and performing arts programs that are now at serious risk. In the global battle for economic investment, local corporations seeking to entice new industries, jobs and capital to our region offset our high taxes and congested highways by using the arts as an attractive inducement. And with the bicounty region now deeply dependent on tourism, some 25 million people who visit Long Island annually now seek out our 12 dance companies, 40 arts organizations, 46 museums, 80 music companies, 30 theater companies and countless art galleries. Far more than the loss of artistic outlets, shutting down the N.E.A. would have a direct, profound and negative impact on Long Island's economy. Without the small stipend many of these artistic programs receive from the National Endowment for the Arts, the vast majority of these cultural attractions would whither and disappear. The battle over the N.E.A. has its roots in the fierce partisan battles that have erupted in Congress over the last several years. Whether it is dollars earmarked for Ernie the Muppet or Ernie the Artist, N.E.A. support is now considered a political litmus by the Congressional leadership. It is as if a performance of Mozart, an exhibit of de Kooning or a performance of ``Swan Lake'' are now battlegrounds for the hearts and minds of the electorate. This is treacherous ground because, for those with a sense of history, there is a faint echo from a not so distant past when a fascist government used the arts to sanitize their murderous regime. To prevent plans from moving ahead to dismantle the National Endowment of the Arts, Long Island, with its population of nearly three million people, is going to have to become far more millitant on behalf of the arts. It should not be unfamiliar territory. As we shifted public policy on issues relating to breast cancer and the environment, we need to take those lessons and apply them to this equally crucial task. Our first step should be the mobilization of those individuals who have served in the past as potent financial and ideological supporters of either major political parties. It will be a powerful message indeed if both Republican and Democratic standard-bearers discover that their core constituencies are united behind a common theme--protection of the arts. We need to condition our support based on where public officials stand as it relates to the arts and their support for the National Endowment. In addition, because of Long Island's financial depth, many of us are targeted by political action committees and campaigns far outside Long Island. We need to include the arts as part of our personal platform for contributions. Elected officials from Maine to California need to know that their support of N.E.A. programs is a critical factor in our determination of whether they are worthy of our dollars. We also need to network with those cultural and performing arts organizations working in Congressional districts where opponents of the arts endowment are located so that our message is carried far beyond the Long Island Expressway. That can be accomplished by becoming more involved with the artistic organizations that currently exist in the bicounty region. As the Long Island Congressional delegation once led the charge to fund locally built weapons systems that defeated our Cold War opponents, let them now use their debating skills to protect the performances, programs and exhibits that now nurture the human spirit and enhance our region's economic and social quality of life. We need only demonstrate our personal leadership to insure that our elected officials pretend that Chopin is a weapons system and vote accordingly.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.Mr. Chairman, the previous speaker, the gentleman from Indiana, asked the question, who will speak for the people who are the victims of violence in Punjab and Kashmir and other places. Let me assure the gentleman that I do and we all do because we decry violence and we decry the abuses of human beings anywhere for any reason. But what the gentleman seeks to do is to punish an entire nation, the largest democracy in the world collectively, for random acts of a few that take place. He brings us one picture and cites hundreds of thousands. How do we condemn a whole nation because of that? That is nothing but India bashing, Mr. Chairman. Do we condemn our own Government because people put a bounty on people's heads in Arizona and people moved in and murdered them? Is that the fault of the whole American Government and the American people?I would like to cite an article that appeared in the Hill newspaper. It is a quote by a gentleman of the House who shows an unbelievable amount of understanding when talking about the Government of Turkey and he says, ``When you have military conflicts,'' and the gentleman here is talking about insurgencies taking place against existing governments, he says, ``When you have military conflicts, you're bound to have unfortunate things happen,'' he said. Continuing the quote, ``People get killed, they're bombed and shot. These things happen,'' he said understandingly and justified, ``incidental and anecdotal things that happen during these times of conflict.'' Who was the gentleman who said that, so understanding of the Government of Turkey? It is the very same gentleman from Indiana who just took the well and offered this amendment. How can he justify it in the case of one country and oppose it when it comes to another country?The gentleman offers up four amendments. Dr. Alukh mysteriously appears in the Halls of the House, in the gallery, it happens each and every time, and the India bashing begins. This, Mr. Chairman, is totally unacceptable. This is not the way two great democracies view each other or treat each other. The gentleman complains of human rights abuses, but he ignores the genuine progress that India has made on this question. According to the State Department report which he only quotes in part, it says ``India made further progress in resolving human rights problems.'' The same report notes that newspapers and magazines ``regularly publish investigative reports and allegations of government wrongdoing, and the press as a whole champions human rights and criticizes'' whenever there is a government lapse. Beyond this, the Indian Government has appointed a National Human Rights Commission with powers to investigate and to recommend policy changes and punishment and compensation in cases of incidental police abuse wherever it might happen to take place. Again in the State Department report that the gentleman quoted only in part, ``The NHRC continued to enlarge its useful role in addressing the patterns of abuse, as well as specific abuses.''In particular, the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Burton] is concerned about human rights in the states of Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. Last year there was an election in Punjab where 65 percent of the eligible voters turned out in a Sikh-dominated government. This is the very minority that the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Burton] claims the Indian Government oppresses. There were also elections in Kashmir which restored elected government there for the first time in 6 years.I think, Mr. Chairman, what we have discovered, with the unwitting help of the gentleman from Indiana, is that India is a fully functioning, mature democracy with a free press, with civilian control of the military, with an independent judiciary, and very active political parties and civic associations. It seems to me that the oldest democracy in the world should not be sanctioning the largest. That is not the way democracies treat each other.In addition to India's thriving democratic institutions, the current united front government led by Prime Minister Gudjaral has pledged, as has the finance minister with whom the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman] and myself met with only a week ago, has pledged to continue the economic reforms of the past 6 years. These reforms have provided enormous opportunities for United States business and, in fact, the United States is now India's largest overseas investor, its biggest trading partner and its preferred source of high-technology.Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a deliberate and specific attempt to stigmatize India at a point where the relationship between the world's two great democracies has flowered. I urge all of my colleagues to stand and to defeat this amendment.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, many of our colleagues may already know the deeply troubling situation that exists in the United States with regard to the veterans of the Nazi war machine.About 8 months ago I discovered that thousands of former soldiers from Hitler's elite Waffen-S.S. corps, now living all around the world, some of whom may have participated in crimes against humanity, have been receiving monthly pensions from the German Government. These fairly generous pensions called, ironically enough, war victims' pensions, are given to Nazi SS officers who sustained injuries during World War II.However, my concern lies with the fact that neither the German Government nor any other government has ever bothered to cross-check the list of applicants and recipients with the international list of known Nazi war criminals. This is unacceptable, particularly since we have learned that at least 3,300 recipients of these Nazi pensions live right here in the United States.The situation becomes ironically intolerable when we realize that according to the American Jewish Committee, which has done a tremendous job in working on this issue, that well over 15,000 Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, and probably at least as many non-Jewish survivors living in Eastern Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union, have never received any compensation from that government for the horrors they were forced to endure in Nazi ghettos and concentration camps.These survivors have been dubbed the ``double victims,'' as they were first victimized by the Nazi nightmare and then again by the Communist governments that took over after the war. Perhaps we need to call them ``triple victims'' at this point since they are once again being victimized by a government who continuously refuses to offer them any compensation. Many of these survivors are also in desperate financial straits as well as in poor health.Based on the information we received regarding the issue of pensions to former Nazi Waffen-SS officers, I wrote to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl requesting that he send us the list of those living in the United States so that the Office of Special Investigations in our State Department and in our Department of Justice could do the necessary cross-checking before the trail to Nazi war criminals grows cold.To the credit of Chancellor Kohl and the German people, he quickly acceded to the request, and our Office of Special Investigations, OSI, under the superb leadership of its Director, Eli Rosenbaum, is currently poring over these lists.Let me also stress that the work that they are doing now is extremely slow and a very tedious and laborious process. OSI continues to be undermanned and underresourced, and this additional major surprise project further strains those capabilities.Therefore, this amendment would simply add $300,000 to the Justice Department appropriation for the specific purposes of investigating the names on the lists that the German Government has provided us. I think this is a prudent and reasonable amendment, and I have been informed by the Director of OSI that this additional appropriation would allow them to hire the needed attorneys and historians in order to complete this list project effectively and efficiently and in a timely manner.",

Few policy decisions will have a more significant impact on our environment and the safety of our communities than this bill before us today. High-level waste is a daunting responsibility which must be afforded the most stringent and thorough deliberation. The determination to transport nuclear waste through 43 States, affecting 52 million people, should not be mandated by political motivations. The potential cost, in terms of the loss of life and the impact on our environment is too great to dictate arbitrary deadlines. If the scientific community is not yet prepared to support the political rhetoric coming from this floor, how can we feel qualified to preempt their authority and expertise?When we in Congress fail to meet our deadlines on appropriations bills, we pass a continuing resolution, and extend the time afforded us to pass informed legislation. With the passage of H.R. 1270, we will be directing the Department of Energy to abide by a deadline which they are not adequately prepared to implement. By doing so, we will endanger our environment and the constituents of almost every Member in this House. As conscientious legislators, we must grant the Department of Energy the same latitude to make informed decisions that we allow ourselves. To do anything less would be the ultimate form of hypocrisy.The scientific feasibility of the Yucca Mountain site has not yet been determined, and when every significant environmental and citizen organization is in opposition to this bill, we must at least acknowledge that there are serious concerns which have not been adequately addressed. In good conscience there is simply no way we can place this deadly material in untested canisters and ship it on poorly maintained railways, through ill prepared and unaware communities, until every issue is resolved and every precaution is taken.

    "title": "ANNETTE LANTOS PAYS TRIBUTE TO RAOUL WALLENBERG",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, Annette Lantos, the wife of our colleague Congressman Tom Lantos of California has been a leading advocate for the Hungarian Holocaust hero, Raoul Wallenberg. Well before her husband was elected to Congress, Annette had established the International Free Wallenberg Committee to press Soviet authorities to release the Swedish humanitarian from prison. Much of the credit for bringing the tragic plight of Wallenberg to international and particularly to American consciousness has been the result of her work.On February 8, Mr. Speaker, Annette Lantos delivered a Tribute to Raoul Wallenberg at a special meeting of the Sydney Australia, chapter of WIZO (Women's International Zionist Organization), the non-party voluntary charitable women's organization which is similar to the organization Hadassah here in the United States. I have received reports of her exceptional presentation, and I ask that her recent address be placed in the Record.Fifty-four years ago, on March 19, 1944, as the Nazi's campaign of terror and genocide finally overtook our native land of Hungary, a young idealistic Swede made his way to Budapest to interpose his own frail body between the Nazi war machine and the persecuted, unarmed thousands facing deportation and annihilation in Auschwitz. By the time Raoul Wallenberg arrived to Budapest, 500,000 Jews from the Hungarian countryside had already been taken to Auschwitz where most perished. But Raoul Wallenberg's arrival to Budapest delayed the execution of the death sentence upon the remaining 300,000 Jews of the cities long enough to enable some 100,000 of them--including my husband Tom and myself--to survive. It is on their behalf, and behalf of their children and their grandchildren that my husband, Tom, and I have dedicated many years of our lives to make Wallenberg's story known, and to honor this great man. When I began my work for Wallenberg in 1975, I had two goals in mind. First and foremost, I wanted to free him from the horrors of the Gulag where he was languishing--by that time for over 30 years. The second goal was to make Raoul Wallenberg's life and accomplishments penetrate the consciousness of mankind and to inspire all those who are touched by his story to become better, more unselfish, more caring human beings, willing to transcend the barriers of race, religion, or nationality in their concern for others. Raoul Wallenberg taught us two major things. First, he taught us that a single individual committed to a noble goal can achieve miracles. Second, he taught us that human rights are indivisible, that it is not enough just to be concerned simply with our own human rights. As Jews or Catholics, Australians of Hungarians or Americans, the only relevant concern for human rights that deserves respect is a concern that transcends religion and race and color and national origin. Raoul Wallenberg did not go to Budapest in 1944 to save Lutheran Swedes. He went there to save Hungarian Jews, with whom he had nothing in common except his common humanity. Raoul Wallenberg not only fought evil, but he also fought indifference, and indifference is the twin of evil. Those who kill are murderers, but those who stand by and do nothing in the face of murder share a complicity in crime. Wallenberg's message was loud and clear. We must fight evil, but just as hard we must fight indifference. Most of you have heard the story of Wallenberg. He started out issuing Swedish passports to all who managed to reach him at the Swedish legation in Budapest. He brilliantly negotiated with the Nazis and later the Arrow Cross gangsters (Hungarian Fascists) who ran Hungary in the final few months of the German occupation, until they recognized the validity of these fictional documents and exempted their owners from deportation and having to wear the yellow star. He bought or leased 32 large apartment houses and succeeded in declaring them Swedish territory in Hungary. Thousands of people were crowded into these protected houses, many of whom he brought back personally from the forced marches heading toward the death camps. He rushed the saved persons to the protected Swedish houses in Budapest. He even brought people back from the railroad cars, pulling them out of deportation trains, and from the banks of the Danube river. He interposed his own body between the fallen victims and the machine guns that were leveled at them by the Arrow Cross guards. When the Russians finally liberated Budapest in January 1945, he believed he was finally safe, and went to their headquarters to report and ask for food and medicine for the surviving victims. The Soviets didn't believe his story. They were convinced that he was an American spy. They kidnaped him on January 17, 1945, and he languished in the Soviet Gulag until 1981, when I personally believe that he finally died still in a Soviet prison. Even today, people ask me whether I think Raoul Wallenberg still lives. I personally do not believe that he is physically alive anymore, but I do believe that in the spiritual sense Wallenberg is more alive than most of us who are still around living our ordinary, day-to-day lives. He is more alive than most of us, because of what he has done. He not only saved lives, but he saved our faith in humanity. He continues every day to touch the lives of thousands of young people the world over, who, hearing or reading his story, testify that they have been inspired to become better human beings and to dedicate themselves to fight for the right of others who are still persecuted and oppressed all over the world. I would like to share with you tonight the writing of one of these young people who has been inspired by Wallenberg. The letter I am about to read to you was written by my granddaughter Chelsea Swett at age 10, on the occasion of the dedication of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC. This truly magnificent museum, a considerable portion of which was paid for by successful Holocaust survivors in America, is not only a memorial to honor those who were consumed in the flames of the Holocaust, but it is intended as a warning to future generations of Americans of the consequences of unbridled racism, religious intolerance and national hatreds. The exhibits at the Holocaust Museum not only highlight the brutality and callous disregard for human life, but they also reflect the occasional heroic willingness of non-Jews to risk their lives in order to save another fellow human being. I am also very grateful that we succeeded in passing an Act of Congress to rename the street upon which the U.S. Holocaust Museum is located as Raoul Wallenberg Place. It is most significant that in addition to the permanent exhibition at the museum there is a special exhibit entitled ``Remember the Children,'' which commemorates the more than one million children who died in the Holocaust. This special exhibit also provides a presentation aimed at children so that they can understand the experience of children who suffered in the Holocaust. It is in connection with the special exhibit ``Remember the Children'' on the occasion of the dedication of the U.S. Holocaust Museum that my granddaughter Chelsea read the following letter:",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, House Concurrent Resolution 222 commends the Organization of American States for its role in successfully aiding the transition of Nicaragua from Civil War to democracy.Mr. Speaker, the OAS role in Nicaragua has proven to be invaluable. The international support and verification commission has resettled former combatants; distributed food and humanitarian assistance; and investigated and documented human rights abuses. In addition, the OAS-CIAV brokered negotiations between the Government of Nicaragua and the rearmed groups; provided critically needed infrastructure; and established local peace commissions to provide an avenue for alternative dispute resolution.Clearly, Santiago Murray and Sergio Caramagna are to be commended for their work as are all the members of the OAS-CIAV team and the follow-on OAS technical cooperation mission. These dedicated professionals have labored long and hard to ease the journey as Nicaragua consolidates its democracy.I want to thank and commend the chairman for introducing the resolution and I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my strong support for the Watts, Moran, Thornberry Amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill. For too long, our nation's military retirees have been denied access to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP) even though they have devoted their entire lives to the defense and security of our nation. Most of these individuals entered the military on the premise that they would be entitled to comprehensive, quality health care for the rest of their lives. Unfortunately, our nation has not lived up to this important commitment.This amendment would create a demonstration program that would enroll 70,000 Medicare eligible members or former members of the armed forces into the FEHBP. The program would be available in six sites around the country. At the end of the project, the Secretary of Defense, and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management will analyze whether or not the demonstration yielded its intended results.Throughout my tenure is Congress, I have often spoken out in behalf of using the FEHBP to cover the underinsured and the uninsured. The FEHBP is financially sound and in most states, the program provides at least three quality benefit plans for its members. This the least we can do for our armed forces who have stood up to protect the rights and freedoms that we all cherish today. After a long fight, we have taken the first step toward providing comprehensive coverage for such brave and selfless individuals. It is my hope that this provision will remain in the conference report and will be signed into law by the President in the most timely manner possible. Our armed forces deserve nothing less.",

She is a dynamic and energetic individual, who will work tirelessly on behalf of the thousands of students in the New York City Public School System. Terri bagan working as a staff assistant in my Queens office when I served in the New York State Senate. I quickly became impressed with her work ethic, and her political savvy. Shortly after being elected to Congress in 1983, I promoted her to be my district administrator where she served with the utmost integrity and compassion until 1990. In this capacity, she made a difference in the lives of thousands of my constituents. Aside from being an invaluable political ally, she became the dearest of friends both to me and to my family.After leaving my office, she was hired by Citibank as the Director of Community Relations and was eventually promoted to be the Vice President of City and State Governmental Relations. At Citibank she helped school principals with professional training and worked to integrate new technology into the public school system. Moreover, she was able to introduce students to the Internet and demonstrated its application to commercial banking.Throughout her career, Terri has been deeply involved in the community. She also serves as the Vice Chair of the Brooklyn Sports Foundation, which seeks to create an indoor sports facility for the New York City Public School System. Terri has also been involved with the Queens Chamber of Commerce and the Queens Public Library where she sought to improve both economic and educational opportunities for the entire community.Terri's commitment to the community, her understanding of the issues, and her public and private sector experience make her uniquely qualified for a position on the New York City Board of Education. I am fully confident that she will be thoroughly equipped to grapple with the enormous complexities of the New York City Public School System. Thus, I ask all of my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in honoring this extraordinary individual whose dedication to the community will continue to make a significant difference in the lives of thousands of New Yorkers.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor RADM Thomas T. Matteson, USMS, who, on July 21, 1998, will retire from the position of Superintendent of the Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) after a total of 41 years of federal service to our nation.While others might have sought permanent retirement after 36 years of active duty in the Coast Guard, RADM Matteson chose to continue to serve America at the United States Merchant Marine Academy. RADM Matteson was on the bridge for five years navigating through perilous and uncharted waters. As he quickly became familiar with the dynamics of the vast maritime and intermodal transportation industry, he strove to ensure that the USMMA's program produced graduates that would serve America's global economic and defense needs.His time as Superintendent has not been easy. Early in his command he faced the possible closure of the Academy. Congressional action resolved this issue at the same time that RADM Matteson ensured the Academy received its ten-year accreditation. In addition, tight federal fiscal policy required good and sometimes creative stewardship to ensure the effects of level funding did not adversely impact the Academy's academic program.During his tenure at the Merchant Marine Academy, Admiral Matterson strove to create a better learning and personal environment for the midshipmen. His guiding hand enhanced the curriculum by creating the new Shipyard and Engineering Management, and Intermodal Transportation majors, and by planning the evolution of a trimester system. Along with his wife Dottie, RADM Matteson strengthened the bond between the Academy's leadership and the regiment by personally cooking hundreds of meals in his home for the future leaders of America, the academy's midshipmen.By traveling around the country to meet with the Academy's alumni body, RADM Matteson discussed the needs of the Academy and supported the need for the Alumni Associations Superintendents Campaign for Excellence, an endowment campaign to fund academic excellence, curriculum development, new technology and learning systems, and leadership training at the United States Merchant Marine Academy.Today, thanks to the devotion of RADM Matteson, the United States Merchant Marine Academy continues to be the most cost-effective federal academy, whose graduates serve our nation for many years beyond their required commitment. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to rise and join with me today in wishing RADM Matteson and his wife fair winds, following seas, a joyous retirement.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, let me thank the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Charlie Rangel), Dean of the New York delegation, ``Mr. New York,'' for bringing us together today. We share today, I think in the waning hours of the 105th Congress, another chapter in the American dream.A generation ago, Madam Speaker, Irish immigrants came here to these shores looking for a better way of life as young people seeking opportunity, as troubles brewed in their homeland of Ireland. One person was Peggy and the other one, Tom Manton. Tom came here, became a skilled laborer, married Peggy, got a job, and worked here in the capital of the free world. He was a tradesman, a plasterer, and he worked on the very buildings that we work and make our speeches in today.Little did Tom Manton from Ireland know at that time as he was applying his trade in these hallowed halls that one day his son would grow up to be a Member of the United States House of Representatives and work in the very building that he helped to build, in the land that with his hands he helped to build as well.Young Tom, when he was born, went to school in Queens, after being born in Manhattan. That was a wise choice, he came to Queens. He went to St. Joseph's Prep Elementary School. He went to St. John's Prep after that, and then he put himself through St. John's University and got a college degree. At the tender age of 19, still a teenager, he joined the Marine Corps and put in 3 years in the service, serving this Nation in Korea.After that, he became a New York City policeman, a tough job. We call them ``New York's Finest,'' and Tom epitomizes that. He certainly is one of New York's finest in every way and every aspect. As the Dean mentioned, he served a tour of duty while on the force on the job, as they say, on the beat in central Harlem, working with the people there.While he worked as a policeman in the City of New York, he put themselves through law school getting a degree from St. John's University during the night, a difficult thing to do while holding down a full-time job in the day.It was shortly after that that he ran for public office and was elected to the New York City Council and became the chairman of the powerful Housing Committee and served the citizens of our great city in that capacity for some 15 years with great distinction.Tom has always been a team player, but when it came time to being able to stand up for what he believed in, he was willing to step forward and rock the boat. He took on the establishment when it was necessary. He ran for the United States Congress and the rest, as we say, is history.He has been our good colleague now for 14 years. How time flies. For 14 years, he served with us in the House of Representatives, serving originally on the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, serving on what was then House Administration, Merchant Marine Committee, and the Committee on Commerce, handling such matters as trade and telecommunications and securities and consumer protection, working hard.Here in a place, Madam Speaker, known as a stable for show horses, Tom proved to be a workhorse. Recognized by all of us as a Member's Member, doing the day-to-day work that was necessary to make this place run, to make it easier for other Members to be able to do their jobs. Doing many jobs that many other Members of Congress would ordinarily shun.In addition to that, he quickly assumed responsibilities as the cochair of the Congressional Ad Hoc Committee on Irish Affairs, a cause, very, very dear to his heart, trying to argue the cause and work for peace with justice in the land of his ancestors. His work, along with that of many others, with his leadership, has begun to finally bear fruit. For that, I know that his dad, Tom, and mom, Peggy, who I know are looking down upon him today, would be very, very proud. It is hard for some of our Members to understand, because of his always friendly smile and congenial personality and attitude, working to build bridges with Members of both parties across both sides of the aisle, is that kind of a person. Yet at the same time, back home, I have to assure my colleagues he is a very partisan political player within the Democratic Party, fighting for the values that we all believe in on our side.A great leader, becoming the county leader of our Democratic Party for at least 12 years, taking the helm of our party in Queens County at a time when it previously had been racked with scandal and had many problems. He straightened out that county organization making it one of the proudest, cleanest, preeminent county parties in the State of New York. Always a person who is fair. Always a person we could count on. Always a person to step up to the plate and exert great leadership.Madam Speaker, I say this with a great deal of reverence and respect: We are losing in this Congress somebody who is one of the last of the old school Irish politicians from New York. He is a guy who will look you in the eye, give you his word, shake your hand and, you could count on the fact that he has been true and faithful to his word. His word is his bond, and we do not see a lot of that in politics too often these days.These are the days of ``blown-dry hair'' politicians, elbowing each other for time in front of the cameras, seeking publicity. Tom represents none of that. He is from the old school. He does the work quietly, behind the scenes, not looking to advance himself in other's eyes, but knowing that he is going to be doing the right thing.We are going to miss him down here in the Congress of the United States. It is going to be my privilege and pleasure, when I return back for weekends to my district which includes the County of Queens, to know that Tom is the county leader. After putting in all of these years, 14 in the Congress and 15 on the City Council, and a term in the Marines and all of that, he returns to private life after giving of himself, returning to his family that so graciously has shared him with us. To his wife Diane, to his children Catherine and Tom Junior and John and Jeanne, and all the grandchildren here and yet to come.We have been privileged to serve with the likes of Tom Manton in this Congress, Madam Speaker. He is a breed hard to find, a breath of fresh air reflecting the best of politics and the best that this system has to offer. I am happy to consider him my dear friend.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my congratulations to Amartya Sen who has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Science for his work on human rights, poverty and inequality.The Indian-born Professor Sen found an academically rigorous way to examine the impact that social policy choices have on rich and poor alike. His ground-breaking work on the 1943 Bengal famine has spawned extensive academic work on social choice and it's economic consequences. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences noted that Professor Sen's research had ``restored an ethnical dimension to the discussion of vital economic problems.'' Professor Sen himself said ``I believe that economic analysis has something to contribute to substantive ethics in the world in which we live.''Professor Sen was also influential in how international organizations deal with food crises. His 1981 book ``Poverty and Famine'' demonstrated that famine was an avoidable economic and political catastrophe and not just a consequence of nature. The United Nations drew heavily on Professor Sen's work in creating the U.N. Development Index which quantifies the quality of life in different countries by looking at such factors as longevity and school enrollment rather than simply examining per capita income.Professor Sen has restored a much needed discussion of values to the study of economics. His work can help us all understand the social consequences of economic choices and reminds us all that ultimately the quality of life is measured by more acquisitions.Mr. Speaker, as the new co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian-Americans, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Professor Sen for a lifetime of significant contributions to the study of economics and for being awarded the Nobel Prize.",

Through her extensive years as a volunteer, she served the PTA as its President, gave her time as Pink Lady at St. John's Hospital, and was appointed to the Small Business Advisory Council. Marcy is an alumna of the Citizens Police Academy, and a member of the Suffolk County Police Reserves. In addition, she has received the Distinguished Business Leaders Award from the March of Dimes.Since 1989, she embraced the challenge of Executive Director for the Hauppauge Industrial Association. Under her tenacious, caring and committed leadership, the membership has more than doubled.She has led this organization and its members into partnerships with outside agencies to establish programs that not only have proven beneficial to the HIA membership and their families, but also have enabled them to expand their companies nationally and globally. She is very proud of her membership involvement in HIA's 17 active committees and partnerships with schools, police departments, ambulance corps, and charitable organizations. Under her watchful eye, the HIA planted the seed for the nation's first intergenerational day care in an industrial park. She embarked on this venture in 1989, and with a handful of volunteers developed and realized her dream. Today, that day-care program has more than 100 participants.Concentrating on providing the best she could for the membership, she encouraged and convinced the Suffolk County Police Department to place a defibrillator in the Park's police sector car, and to establish a medical emergency police vehicle to provide immediate assistance to the victims of emergency situations in the Industrial Park.Marcy is a life-long resident of Long Island, where she lives today with Mark, her husband of 35 years. Her pride and joy are her two daughters: Ilyse, a Physical Therapist at South Side Hospital, and Beth, a health-care consultant for Price Waterhouse.A person is truly judged successful if she is able to bring about positive change that enhances and broadens the lives of others. Clearly, Marcy fulfills this notable standard.Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me now in saluting Marcy Tublisky for her outstanding leadership, creativity and commitment, and to extend our best wishes and congratulations as she is honored by the members of the Hauppauge Industrial Association.",

Through prudent economic policies that have kept foreign debt low and foreign exchange reserves high, Taiwan managed to post a 4.8% GDP growth rate last year.Mr. Speaker, the Taiwan Relations Act also speaks to the commitment of the United States to support Taiwan's Legitimate self-defense needs and recognizes that Taiwan's future must be decided by peaceful means only. The resolution before us today notes that cross-strait discussions are ongoing and urges the People's Republic of China to renounce the use of force as a means.Mr. Speaker, the Taiwan Relations Act has served the United States and Taiwan well as the policy framework that guides our relationship.

Quinn, joined the Suffolk County Democratic Committee and began his sojourn into local politics. At the same time, this Iona College graduate began his career as a teacher in the Middle Country School District, where he went on to become the principal of the unique school without walls, New Lane Elementary School. Joe retired from the Middle Country School District in 1988 after 28 years of outstanding career in education.Joe Quinn's dedication and loyalty to the Democratic Party is unsurpassed. Joe often boasts of the 22 officials that were elected under his leadership, ``one for every year as leader.'' He should take pride in that accomplishment, as those victories symbolized his commitment to the ideals of the Democratic Party and of our Nation.Mr. Speaker, on May 20, the Suffolk County Democratic Committee will honor and pay tribute to Joseph Quinn at a gala dinner.

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1000, the Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century.Th New York metropolitan area air space is the busiest in the nation. While many people enjoy the benefits of frequent flights into and out of New York, my constituents are forced to endure the noise of a plane landing or taking off every 30 seconds at LaGuardia Airport, as well as the pollution and traffic congestion. During the one minute that I will be speaking on the Floor, one plane will take off, and another plane will land at LaGuardia. If the High Density rule is lifted, the sky is literally the limit for the number of take-offs and landings that can be added to an already overcrowded LaGuardia and JFK airports.There is also a legitimate need for more flights and lower prices for airline travel to underserved markets. I am pleased that the Manager's Amendment strikes a reasonable compromise for both positions. In order to provide better service from underserved markets, regional jets will be exempt from the High Density Rule for service from LaGuardia or JFK Airports to nonhub or small hub airports, effective January 1, 2000. And, to protect those people who live, work and go to school in the areas near these airports, the High Density Rule will remain in place until January 1, 2000. And, to protect those people who live, work and go to school in the areas near these airports the high Density Rule will remain in place until January 1, 2007 for all other jet service.I am particularly proud to have worked with other Members of the New York, New Jersey, Connecticut tri-state area, particularly, Mr. Crowley, Mr. Meeks, Mr. Weiner, and Mrs. Maloney, in addition to the diligent work of the Transportation Committee, Chairman Shuster, Ranking Member Oberstar, Chairman Duncan, and Ranking Member Lipinski. Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to join us in supporting this amendment which is a win-win situation for all parties, and a major victory for the people of Queens and all of New York.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for H. Res. 211, which underscores our nation's support for prostate cancer research and testing. All too often, men and their families remain silent about this deadly disease, which will claim the lies of an estimated 37,000 individuals this year alone.It is critical that our nation starts to talk about prostate cancer in order to increase our awareness about early testing and treatment options. We in the Congress took an important step in fighting this condition by providing Medicare coverage for the prostate specific antigen blood test (PSA) and the digital rectal exam (DRE). I, along with a bipartisan group of House members recently urged HCFA to implement coverage for these procedures in the most timely manner possible. By providing this critical coverage, we can save the lives of thousands of men, while saving Medicare a substantial amount of funding.We can also provide real hope for the 180,000 men who are estimated to be diagnosed with prostate cancer by investing in research. We still have a long way to go before we really understand the risk factors associated with the disease. It is my hope that the National Institutes of Health and other Federal agencies will continue their groundbreaking research into this disease.I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this important resolution, which clearly states our commitment to treating and eventually curing this terrible disease.",

Kings Point's mission is to train young men and women to serve and to lead in our Merchant Marine, our Armed Forces, and in the transportation field.In times of peace, these Merchant Mariners contribute to our international trading prosperity. In times of war, it is the Merchant Mariners who enable our country to move troops and materiel anywhere, anytime.Despite rising costs over the years, the funding has remained nearly static for each of the last 5 years. The result of this level of funding is a real dollar budget cut for Kings Point. The 55-year-old infrastructure is in need of millions of dollars of capital maintenance repair projects.Included in these projects are barracks renovation, Y2K compliance requirements, maintenance of the 220-foot training vessel, the King's Pointer, instructional technology and training requirements, and improvements in waterfront renovation.Congress has already recognized the need for additional funds for the Merchant Marine Academy. In their report for the Defense Authorization Bill for fiscal year 1999, the House Committee on Armed Services said that they are ``concerned about the deteriorating material condition of the physical plant of the midshipmen barracks at the Merchant Marine Academy.''They go on to say, ``The plant is antiquated and in need of replacement before it becomes a health and safety concern to the midshipmen and the staff.''It is to this facility, Mr. Chairman, that, as Members of Congress, we nominate some of the finest young men and women so that they might study and become graduates of the academy. We must work to ensure that the academy is safe and conducive to this training.This funding for fiscal year 2000 will help it achieve this goal so that the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy can achieve their mission of providing our country with the highest quality Merchant Marine officers.I ask all of our colleagues to join with us in supporting this critical amendment.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 900, the Financial Services Modernization Bill. This is indeed a momentous day as we prepare to pass this historic legislation.S. 900 achieves many goals in financial modernization to better serve consumers and businesses. The measure creates one-step shopping for bank accounts, insurance policies and securities transactions, requires banks to disclose bank surcharges on ATM machines and on the screens of ATM machines before a transaction is made, and ensures that banks lend to all segments of their communities with the continued applicability of the Community Reinvestment Act.I was particularly proud to be a conferee on the financial privacy section of this bill. After months of negotiations, we have crafted, what I believe, is a strong provision which will enhance the privacy that consumers want and deserve. Four provisions in particular evidence the achievements in the bill.The first provision addresses disclosure requirements. Currently, financial institutions do not have to disclose their financial privacy provisions to their customers. Consumers have a right to know what the policy is, and S. 900 will require these institutions to inform all new customers of their policy and to update existing customers at least once a year.Second, the bill allows in most instances for consumers to ``opt-out'' of their financial institution's information sharing agreements with unaffiliated third parties. This arrangement strikes a balance between protecting consumer privacy and facilitating regular financial activities.Third, the measure expressly prohibits financial institutions including banks, savings and loans, credit unions, securities firms and insurance companies, from disclosing a customer's bank account or credit card numbers to unaffiliated third parties for telemarketing, direct mail marketing or electronic mail purposes.And finally, this legislation bans, with minor safety exceptions, the despicable practice known as pretext calling. This blatantly criminal activity in which an individual impersonates another in order to trick an institution into providing confidential information, would be punishable by both imprisonment and fines.I applaud the hard work and dedication of the Conferees from the House and the Senate, as well as the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the White House. Without this cooperation, we would not be here today voting on S. 900. I encourage my colleagues to join with me and vote for the Financial Services Modernization bill, S. 900.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise today to indicate my strong support on behalf of H.R. 1776, The American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act. This important bill opens the prospect of homeownership to many deserving American families, particularly in my area of Northeast Queens, northern Nassau County and Northwestern Suffolk County, New York where homeownership opportunities have lagged because of affordability concerns.Despite a strong economy and record percentages of Americans who own their own homes, in my district we continue to experience gaps in homeownership especially among our middle-income professionals--teachers, police officers, firefighters, and corrections officers. These deserving individuals have the necessary income to make their monthly mortgage payments but not enough cash for the downpayments necessary to purchase the home in the communities where they work.H.R. 1776 appropriately addresses this problem. The legislation contains important provisions that will now permit deserving Queens and Long Island teachers and public employees to obtain mortgages with just one percent downpayment requirement through the Federal Housing Administration. Plus, H.R. 1776 allows qualifying homebuyers to defer the payment of the upfront mortgage insurance premium--customarily two percent of the mortgage amount. As a result of these beneficial provisions, qualified borrowers can expect to save thousands of dollars in upfront costs when they purchase a home. I cannot begin to imagine how valuable the savings will mean for ownership in the Queens and Long Island areas as a result of H.R. 1776.Mr. Chairman, housing is the foundation on which everything else is built. In Queens and Long Island, homeownership holds many tangible benefits that range from increased educational attainment for children residing in an owned home to homeowners maintaining a more active interest and involvement in the communities in which they reside. H.R. 1776 certainly contributes to these important positive outcomes and I wholeheartedly urge my colleagues to vote in support of this important legislation.",

The Sound is one of our Nation's natural treasures with important environmental, recreational and commercial benefits. Its value as an essential habitat for one of the most diverse ecosystems in the Northeast cannot be understated. Residents and vacationers alike enjoy the Sound for swimming and boating, and the approximately $5 billion in revenue generated by commerce relating to the Sound is vital to the region as well as to individuals who base their livelihood on the benefits of the Long Island Sound.Unfortunately, the effects of millions of people on the shore and in the Sound are evidenced by the deteriorated water quality. Over the last several years, the Long Island Sound has suffered from numerous forms of pollution which has caused a dramatic drop in the Sound's fish population. As a result of the pollution, the Sound's multibillion dollar a year fishing industry is in jeopardy. The most recent devastating example that we have heard about is the unexplained and widespread lobster die-off. We must supply adequate resources to address this crisis and to examine possible problems in the water that could have caused the crisis.Preservation of the Long Island Sound is not a parochial issue but a national one. Its inclusion as a charter member in the National Estuaries Program, the Sound has been designated as one of only 28 estuaries of national significance. The time to act is now. When I first introduced this legislation by this name in 1992, and again in every subsequent Congress, the price tag was $50 million. Now it is $80 million. It will not get cheaper if we wait any longer.I am pleased to say and to note that both the States of New York and Connecticut are prepared to match the $80 million authorization with State funds, and I am confident that these funds will have a significant impact on the ongoing efforts to improve the quality of the Sound. We must do everything possible to ensure the continued funding of these efforts, and this legislation is the appropriate means for achieving the desired end. I urge all of our colleagues to join with us in supporting this legislation.",

It is with great pride that I pay tribute to two people who I have known closely, and with whom I have worked with on numerous issues critical to the Jewish community and beyond. Joseph and Chana Simckes have made the Jewish sage Hillel's ancient dictum, ``Do not separate yourself from the community,'' a living guide for their lives and the basis for their continuing efforts to promote social justice and human dignity from within and beyond the walls of the synagogue.Rabbi Simckes has been an exemplary spiritual leader, teaching Jewish values and providing moral guidance by his personal example, and I confidently expect that he will continue to be a source of leadership, learning and compassion for his congregation. Rabbi Simckes came to the Hollis Hills Jewish Center from a pulpit in Massachusetts and has been an energetic community leader in Jewish philanthropy, Jewish education and pro-Israel advocacy. Holding a doctorate in Pastoral Counseling, with experience in psycho-therapy, Rabbi Simckes has been a source of counsel and comfort for hundreds of my constituents, sharing his great wisdom and boundless compassion.Equally, Chana Simckes has won the hearts and respect of the Hollis Hills Jewish Center, and the larger Jewish community beyond, through her commitment and involvement in sustaining Jewish continuity and values. A refugee from Nazi Germany, Chana Simckes has embodied the American dream: graduating from Columbia University, succeeding as a professional in Jewish education, and rising to the leadership of numerous Jewish community organizations, all while raising a growing family.Joseph and Chana Simckes have elevated and improved the lives of their community, providing those around them with guidance, education, support and leadership. Stalwart advocates of social action, tireless champions of the Jewish people and the values of the Torah, I am honored to share with this House their marvelous example, and to hold them up for the recognition they both so richly deserve.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to rise in support of the Bonior-Campbell amendment, which is an absolutely necessary measure to root out an on-going government practice which should be offensive to all of us as sworn defenders of the Constitution.The very idea of ``secret evidence'' should alarm us as a nation that cherishes the rule of law. That our government, a government built on transparency and due process, should incarcerate people indefinitely and by executive fiat, and deprive them of the basis to defend themselves, is an affront to the Constitution.Our nation's justice system is a source of pride, not because of the efficiency of its operations, or its effectiveness in convicting the guilty, important as these things are. We are appropriately proud of our justice system because of its unyielding insistence on due process for the individual against the state; because of its strict adherence to Constitutional requirements necessary for government action and limitations on state authority. In criminal matters, before the federal government deprives anyone, citizen or non-citizen, of their right to life, liberty or property, the Constitution demands--demands, not requests, not suggests, not proposes--demands, that the government detail the charges to be prosecuted; produce its witnesses for cross-examination; provide compulsory means for the defense to obtain its own witnesses; and settle the matter of guilt or innocence by decision of a jury of ordinary citizens. This is the American standard of justice.Some will argue that detention and treatment of aliens is a category of government action apart from Constitutional mandates. I disagree. The Constitution is not to be considered mute as a matter of convenience. The actions of the executive branch are always bound by the strictures of the Constitution; there is no free-play zone for non-citizens.A decision by the Federal Government to deport, to grant asylum or residency, or to detain a non-citizen does not exist in some extra-Constitutional universe. The Executive Branch is not compelled by law to hold people on secret evidence. There is no legal obligation for the government to detain aliens indefinitely. If the state is concerned that judicial proceedings would require the disclosure of classified information to the detriment of the nation, the government always has the flexibility not to act. Prosecution is a political decision and is done at the discretion of the government's attorneys. Hard choices are part of life.It may be that precluding the use of secret evidence will lead to the release of some dangerous individuals. This is a regrettable but necessary price we must pay for a free society bound by the rule of law. Sometimes releasing the guilty or the dangerous is the unfortunate result of limited government. The threat of terrorism is real, and our government should do all it can to preempt and punish those who would do violence to our people and interests. But in doing so, we must not do harm to the Constitution, which is exactly what the use of secret evidence does.I urge my colleagues to support the Bonior-Campbell amendment.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to bring to the House's attention the 40th anniversary of the Korean-American Association of Greater New York, a community institution representing the interests, hopes and dreams of thousands of Korean-Americans. Mr. Speaker, the Korean-American community in New York epitomizes the American dream.Decades ago, thousands of immigrants, fleeing from war, poverty and desolation came to our nation's gateway of opportunity: New York City. Without knowing the language, without great wealth, but with strong family ties, robust community support and countless hours of hard work, Korean-Americans, like waves of immigrants before them have taken root and thrived in America.Critical to their success was their ability to organize themselves for mutual support and assistance. At the heart of the Korean-American community's efforts were organizations like the Korean-American Association of Greater New York. Beginning in 1960, the Korean-American Association of Greater New York has helped Korean immigrants in learning English, organizing themselves within the blue-collar industries where they were able to find work, registering to vote, and developing youth and government outreach programs.Now, as is obvious to anyone who travels in the New York metropolitan area, second generation Korean-Americans have moved into every branch and comer of American life and have succeeded beyond the wildest expectations of their ancestors, who came to this country with so little in tangible goods, but with a wealth of determination and perseverance.As we recalled so recently, on the anniversary of the Korean War, Korea and the United States are joined inseparably by a bond of allegiance formed in war and bound in the blood of the fallen soldiers of both nations. Similarly, Korean-Americans, whose presence here in the United States is tied with the great tragedy of that war, remember the great sorrow of the war for Korea together with an immeasurable appreciation for their adopted homeland. The courage and loyalty of the American soldier in answering the Republic of Korea in its hour of need is now matched by the devotion of Korean-Americans to this nation.Just as the Republic of Korea and its relations with the United States have flourished and grown stronger in the years since the war, so too the Korean-American community has prospered and given back to this nation double what they have received. Nowhere is this fact more obvious than in New York.I am honored, therefore, to pay tribute in this House to the Korean-American Association of Greater New York and its president, Sie Jong Lee, for their critical role in the success of the Korean-American community. I would also like to recognize all the current officers of the Association, Yong Sang Yoon, Jeong Ho Kim, Bok Ja Chang, Heon Gae Lee, Jay Joonseok Oh, Piljae Im, Hyun Woo Han, Myung Sook Chun, Daehong Kim, Mi Kyung Choi, Young-Joo Rhee, and Bo Young Jung, and to wish them all the best of success in the decades to come.",

This measure authorizes $1.6 billion over five years for various estuary conservation and restoration activities, including the Long Island Sound.Preservation of the Long Island Sound is not a parochial issue, but a national one. By its inclusion as a charter member in the National Estuaries Program, the Sound has been designated as one of only 28 estuaries of national significance. Congress recognized the national importance of the Sound by creating the Long Island Sound Study (LISS), which involved Federal, state, and local entities as well as private groups. The result of this study was the Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP). This report has detailed the many challenges which Long Island Sound faces including floating garbage, biological contamination, and industrial waste--in short, all the things which plague our modern society.The time to act is now. The $200 million over 5 years which is authorized under this agreement, will be used to provide grants to implement remedial efforts to clean up the Long Island Sound as part of the CCMP.I am proud to represent an area that borders the Long Island Sound. The Sound is one of our nation's natural treasures with important environmental, recreational, and commercial benefits.

I would like to thank Mr. Shuster and Mr. Oberstar for their leadership on this legislation and their commitment to preserving our national estuaries. I would also like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of my colleagues who represent areas along Long Island Sound.

I think some of us read it in a different way that choosing a level that reflects a requirement, and the key word is a ``requirement,'' on the Medicare+Choice organizations to offer plans that are no less than 3 years old. We think that that means that they can expend no funds other than to write a contract that would last 3 years. Anything else would be unacceptable under the language that we are offering.Our senior citizens are in trouble in this country. They are not doing as well as so many other segments of society. There is so much uncertainty and insecurity in their lives that the instability that the current system offers them is totally unacceptable.We approach things a little bit differently on Long Island, our congressional delegation that is, and we try to do things in more of a nonpartisan way when it affects our constituents. So we worked together, each and every one of us, Democrats and Republicans alike. And in the County of Suffolk, which is on the eastern end of Long Island, which I proudly share with our colleague, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lazio), we have a situation which is critical that is highlighted by this legislation.Every single Medicare+Choice plan, with the exception of one, has announced that they are leaving Suffolk County because they are not being reimbursed quickly enough or adequately enough; and our senior citizens, those of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lazio) and mine, are absolutely traumatized. They do not know what is going to happen.The one remaining plan has already announced they are going to have an additional $75 premium each month. Somebody has to come down here to the floor and stick up for those senior citizens who are living in abject fear, whether they be in the district of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lazio) or my district on Long Island.And those are not the only places. All of these, these are single-space lists of counties throughout the country where this problem is imminent right now. But in our county, that of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lazio) and mine, the announcement has already been made that they are packing up and leaving. They have given their 6-month notice.These people have nowhere to go. There is but one plan left. What happens to my colleague's seniors? What happens to my seniors with the remaining plan if they are only limited to one more year? Where will these people go? They will have no coverage. And if that is the case, shame on each and every one of us for not providing to our constituents the protection that they need.The constituents of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lazio) need it. My constituents need it. And the constituents of so many Members whose districts appear on these lists need it, as well.",

All of us who love liberty are justified in noting this important day. Greece is the birthplace of the democratic ideal, the principle upon which all our work here depends. The genius of the American republic and the concept of liberty, which sustained our fight for independence, cannot be separated from the great works of the philosophers of ancient Greece.Every ethnic group in the United States can claim a special bond to our nation's essence. But Greek-Americans can take special pride in knowing that our constitution's organizing principle, ``a government of the people, by the people and for the people'' came to our shores from the heart of the Aegean.Madam Speaker, Greece has been a friend and ally to the United States longer than many countries have been in existence. And, through immigration, our nation has been the great beneficiary of the strength, wisdom and creativity of Greece's sons and daughters. Millions of Americans who can trace their family roots back to Greece have contributed in countless ways, large and small, to the greatness, prosperity and harmony of the United States.I believe the influence of Greece on our nation is underappreciated because it is so ubiquitous. We see it in our nation's architecture, it surrounds us in our theater and humanities, it is instilled in our national intellect at all of our great universities. We need only look around this chamber to sense how critical Greece's legacy to our country has been.Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, Representative Michael Bilirakis and Representative Carolyn Maloney, for helping to organize this salute to Greek Independence Day.

In particular Bangladesh has made major strides to meet the needs of its growing population and is now largely self-sufficient in rice production. Bangladesh is also a leader in microenterprise lending. The world famous Grameen Bank has provided small business loans to more than 2.4 million customers in 39,000 villages. The bank has a 98 percent loan recovery rate from its customers, 94 percent of whom are women. In a recent and promising development, 40-50 trillion cubic feet of natural gas have been discovered giving Bangladesh a long term source of energy and enough to become a natural gas exporter.U.S.-Bangladesh relations have also grown in recent years. The United States is Bangladesh's number one trading partner. U.S. investment in Bangladesh has grown from $25 million to over $750 million in the last four years. But economic interests are not the only ties that bind the U.S. and Bangladesh.Bangladesh has played a significant role in international peacekeeping activities. Several thousand Bangladeshi military personnel are deployed overseas on peacekeeping operations. Under U.N. auspices, Bangladeshi troops have served or are serving in Somalia, Rwanda, Mozambique, Kuwait, Bosnia, Haiti, and East Timor. Regionally, Bangladesh is a nation at peace with its neighbors and focused on regional integration through the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.In addition, Bangladesh has demonstrated its commitment to environmental preservation by becoming the first country to participate in a debt for nature swap under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998. This program allowed Bangladesh to exchange a portion of its concessional debt to the United States in return for the preservation of more than 3 million acres of tropical forest home to the world's last genetically viable population of Bengal tigers.Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in commending the nation of Bangladesh for 30 years of independence.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer my amendment to prevent the marketing of downed animals.As I stand here before you, the most horrific problem of animal abuse in the meat industry continues unchecked. A sick cow, unable to stand, is pulled off a truck by a tractor with a chain, then falls 4 feet to the ground at a stockyard. A frail day-old calf is dragged through an auction ring by a rope tied to its back leg while another calf, nearly comatose, is left in a corner dying. These are downed animals. The transport and marketing of these incapacitated animals creates tremendous human health concerns as well as humane concerns.These animals, known as downers, suffer beyond belief as they are kicked, dragged, and prodded with electric shocks in an effort to move them at auctions and intermediate markets en route to slaughter. They make up nearly one-tenth of 1 percent of the market. And not to euthanize them just because they are of no value when they are dead at marketplace is indeed a sin.It is practically impossible to move these animals humanely, so they are commonly dragged with chains and pushed around with tractors and fork lifts. In addition to brutal handling, downed animals routinely suffer for days without food, water, or veterinary attention. Livestock markets are not equipped nor can they be expected to provide these incapacitated animals with the intensive care they require, nor do we wish to saddle them with these costs. The only humane option for nonambulatory livestock at intermediate markets is euthanasia.My amendment to protect both the public health and the downed animals prohibits marketing of all nonambulatory livestock at intermediate markets, and it requires that incapacitated animals be humanely euthanized at these facilities. This amendment does not apply to activities on farms, and it does not preclude veterinary care. It provides an appropriate remedy to an unnecessary and inexcusable practice.The problem of downed animals has been addressed by many conscientious livestock organizations who have voluntarily adopted a no-downer policy in an effort to end this inhumane and cruel practice which can also pose a serious threat to our public health. Meat from downed animals has an increased risk for bacterial contamination and other diseases, including neurological afflictions such as mad cow disease. The veterinary services department at the USDA itself, Mr. Chairman, has said that downed animals are the number two risk for mad cow disease. This is not a fringe idea.Last year, the USDA itself instituted a policy precluding the purchase of beef from downed animals for the national school lunch program because of these safety concerns.How on God's Earth can they justify marketing this to the rest of the country, when they say it is unsafe to put in our school lunch program?In addition to this, the fast food chains are doing the appropriate thing. Chains such as McDonald's and Burger King and Wendy's have all banned the use of meat from downed animals in their products. And who else? California, the largest cattle producer in the country, Colorado and Illinois, have already prohibited the entry of downed animals into the food supply. Why just them? All Americans must be protected from this risk.And who else is in support? This measure is endorsed by the Central Livestock Association, which is composed of 25,000 producers in five Midwestern States alone. It is endorsed by Empire Livestock Marketing, the Georgia Cattlemen's Association, and the National Pork Producers Council; and the National Cattlemen's Beef Producer Association have put in their code of ethics that they will not use downers.And yet, and yet, there are some who kowtow to the few irresponsible folks within the industry in order to protect only one-tenth of 1 percent of the market.Earlier this year a Zogby America Poll of 1,000 people in our country found that four out of every five opposed the use of downed animals for human food. Yet despite a strong consensus within the livestock industry, the animal welfare movement and 80 percent of consumers that downed animals should not be sent to the stockyards, this practice continues, causing unnecessary animal suffering and an erosion of the public confidence in their food. We need to remedy this atrocity.I urge all who are concerned about public health, all who are concerned about the humane treatment of animals to support the amendment.The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Hastings of Washington). The time of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Ackerman) has expired.(By unanimous consent, Mr. Ackerman was allowed to proceed for 30 additional seconds.)",

The FHA multifamily loan programs support the new construction and substantial rehabilitation of much needed affordable rental housing.Our Nation faces a growing affordable housing crisis for low- and moderate-income families. Yet the FHA multifamily loan limits have not been raised in 9 years. How can we expect the private sector to produce affordable rental housing, when they cannot receive affordable financing?Construction costs have risen more than 25 percent since the last increase. One simple way to stimulate the development of affordable housing in our communities is to increase the multifamily loan limits. In my home State of New York, the current limit is $87,226 per two-bedroom unit. In the last 4 years not one unit has been produced under the FHA multifamily loan program, due to that low number. The 25-percent increase established in this conference agreement would raise the limit in New York to $106,952.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this necessary and important increase that will benefit so many working families throughout our Nation.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, one of the newest members Raja Sabha, the Upper House of India's national parliament is Murli Deora, who has been one of the United States' strongest advocates and closest friends for many years. Murli's election to the Raja Sabha is a well deserved honor which some might say is long overdue.Murli has enjoyed a distinguished career as a public servant in India and throughout the world. A former mayor of Mumbai, India's largest city, Murli served for many years in India's Lower House, the Lok Sabha, where he rose to prominence in a number of areas, including India-U.S. relations. Murli worked tirelessly to bring the world's oldest democracy closer to the world's largest democracy. Murli carried on this effort even when relations between our two countries grew distant during the Cold War. Because of Murli's foresight, countless politicians and business leaders in the United States have long sought his counsel and advice on matters in India.Mr. Speaker, as a former Chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, as well as a former Co-Chairman of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian-Americans, I can attest to the generous time and energy Murli has given to fostering ties between our two countries. I have also had the privilege of working with Murli when he served as International President of Parliamentarians for Global Action, a worldwide inter-parliamentary organization focusing on many critical issues facing the world today. I also have watched with great interest and much pride as Murli built a series of computer training centers in many Indian cities to provide underprivileged children with free computer education.Mr. Speaker, for the last several years Murli has immersed himself in the activities of the Red Cross in India, where he has served as Vice-Chairman. A legendary fund raiser, Murli secured critical funds to bring much needed relief for the victims of the devastating earthquake which rocked Gujurat last year. His important work in India earned Murli the second highest position at the Red Cross's international headquarters in Geneva.Mr. Speaker, Murli Deora's uncontested election to the Raja Sabha is a crowning achievement for a long and distinguished career in Indian politics. I am certain that all of our colleagues who are active in promoting stronger ties between the United States and India join me in extending congratulations and best wishes to Murli and his family. I am confident that, as Murli ascends to this important legislative body, that the citizens of India will once again benefit from his longstanding advocacy for democracy, economic development, social welfare and secularism.",

    "text": "Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3994, the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act.At the outset, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman Hyde) and the ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), for their tremendous efforts to craft a bipartisan bill supporting rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance in Afghanistan.It is important for the Congress to speak loudly and clearly regarding a long-term commitment to Afghanistan, and I think the bill before us today does just that. In addition, the bill answers the President's call last October for the Congress to support reconstruction assistance for Afghanistan.As has been noted, the bill provides over $1 billion for humanitarian relief, refugee assistance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction in Afghanistan. This assistance is linked to adherence to the Bonn process and to progress on eradicating poverty, but in neither case is the aid so closely linked that it deprives the President of the flexibility necessary to pursue U.S. objectives in that country.Throughout the bill, the importance of the role of women is emphasized, from the structure of the future government to health care and education programs specifically for women and girls. In addition, the assistance has a particular focus on the agricultural economy in Afghanistan. I think this is especially important given that the vast majority of Afghans live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for their livelihood.The emphasis also dovetails nicely with our efforts to eradicate poppy by giving farmers a viable alternative to the narcotics trade.Madam Chairman, the bill also authorizes military assistance to support the formation of an Afghan police force and a national army. In addition, this assistance is available to foreign countries or international organizations who are directly supporting our military activities in Afghanistan, or are participating in peacekeeping or policing operations there. I believe that the military assistance provisions are appropriate and are focused on the needs of U.S. policy.Madam Chairman, this bill is an excellent example of what can be accomplished through bipartisan efforts. I commend the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) for their leadership on this issue, and I urge all of our colleagues to support the bill.",

    "text": "Madam Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words, and I rise in support of the Lantos amendment.Madam Chairman, I congratulate the gentleman from California for offering his amendment, because it highlights a particularly important aspect of our current efforts in Afghanistan. Everything we have achieved to the present time is dependent on the security situation in Afghanistan. No level of assistance will be effective if aid workers cannot reach those in need.Indeed, the Committee on International Relations received testimony from AID administrator Andrew Natsios that the current security situation on the ground is unsuitable for rapid or sustainable change. The Secretary of Defense has also said that before anything else can happen in Afghanistan, there must be security.Yet, humanitarian aid organizations have reported threats to their workers and attempts at extortion by local commanders. These conditions will not only threaten the delivery of humanitarian assistance, but they will make it impossible to establish an effective program of reconstruction.Recent events such as the assassination attempt on Defense Minister Fahim, the foiled plot to kill Afghanistan's King Zahir Shah, which delayed his return to his country, and the tragic killing of a United Nations aid worker are all part of a disturbing pattern of rising violence, a pattern that threatens to undermine the Loya Jirga process. In fact, Human Rights Watch reports that insecurity in certain provinces has caused the cancellation of Loya Jirga elections in portions of those provinces.Madam Chairman, there are immediate security needs that as of now are going unmet. If we do not address the situation now, U.S. troops who are on the ground will have to stay in Afghanistan even longer. Such insecurity aspects put our troops at greater risk and threaten our ability to meet our military objectives in Afghanistan.I know that the administration is opposed to expanding the International Security Force beyond the boundaries of Kabul, and I know the President supports the training of an Afghan police force and a national army. I support the President in the rebuilding of these institutions. Afghanistan should ultimately be responsible for their own security. But these are long-term solutions. Even the Department of Defense acknowledges that it will be at least 18 months before a national army is ready. What are the citizens of Afghanistan to do in the meantime?We need a strategy to bridge the gap between now and the time when the Afghans can truly provide their own security across the country and that, Madam Chairman, that is what the amendment asks for.Since the President has already foreclosed the option of expanding the International Security Assistance Force, I believe that it is incumbent upon him and the administration to provide an alternative solution. Without U.S. leadership on this question, nothing will be done to address it. The President has said, and I agree, that Afghanistan's persistent poverty, war, and chaos laid the groundwork for the Taliban to seize power. If nothing is done now to address the security situation in Afghanistan, we risk plunging that nation back into the conflict from which it has so recently emerged.Madam Chairman, the Lantos amendment can help us to avoid that fate, and I urge all of our colleagues to support it.",

On June 15th, 2002, at the 53rd National Civic League Convention in Kansas City, Missouri. Huntington was selected out of 30 finalists to be proclaimed an All-American City, and thus became the first Long Island community to receive this impressive designation.The All-American City Award is one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious distinctions, given to those communities, which demonstrate outstanding leadership and collaboration in addressing community-wide challenges and achieving exceptional results.This spring, the Town of Huntington's Chamber of Commerce, a business partnership that represents more than 1,300 members, was officially notified by the National Civic League that Huntington had been selected as a finalist for the 2002 All-American City Award. For the next month and a half, the Chamber of Commerce prepared extensively for a final 10-minute formal presentation to be given before the All-American City Jury Panel. It was the success of this final presentation, which highlighted three community-based projects, that clinched the award for Huntington.Mr. Speaker, this distinction is a glowing reflection on all members of the Huntington community. Specifically, I would like to call attention to the tireless work of Dennis Sneden, the CEO of the Huntington Township Chamber of Commerce; Frank Petrone, the Town Supervisor; Board members Marlene Budd, Mark Cuthbertson, Susan Berland, and Mark Capadonno and all the individuals and businesses, citizens and entrepreneurs, of the Huntington community.Commenting on Huntington's success, Town Supervisor Petrone summed up the reason for Huntington's smashing success. ``This designation speaks to the commitment of a community which works together for the betterment of all its residents,'' he said. ``The partnership between Huntington Township Chamber of Commerce and the Town of Huntington's government sets an example for the region.''I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me now in honoring this historic achievement, and in congratulating all the members of the Huntington community for the inspirational example they have provided for cities, towns and villages throughout New York State and our entire nation.",

Bom in a rural village in Gujurat, he rose from a small trader of textiles and spices to head the largest and most profitable industrial concern in India, the Reliance Group. Through a series of shrewd. business moves and decades of hard work, Dhirubhai Ambani transformed Reliance from a minor retail concern into an entity which included the largest and most modem refinery in Asia, a petrochemical business of unparalleled quality, a five billion dollar satellite and broadband subsidiary, and petroleum and refining businesses which set the standard throughout South Asia. At the time of his death, Dhirubhai Ambani oversaw an economic juggernauht which accounted in almost 3 percent of India's GDP and 16 percent of the value of the Bombay Stock Exchange. He was one of the wealthiest men in the world, a recognized billionaire by Forbes Magazine, and in 2000 he was rightly acknowledged by Business India magazine as India's Businessman of the Century.Mr. Speaker, although Dhirubhai Ambani became very rich, his wealth was never closely held. Unlike many old line Indian companies, Dhirubhai Ambani shunned debt financing from banks and instead offered shares in Reliance to India's growing middle class. Shares in Reliance were eagerly purchased whenever offered. Today there are more than three million shareholders, almost all of whom are financially far better off as a result of their investment.For anyone who may wonder about the ability of capitalism to flourish in the Indian economy, despite that country's long dance with government intervention and control, one need look no further than the story of The Reliance Group and its departed Chairman, Dhirubhai Ambani.Mr. Speaker, as the Former Chairman of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans and a frequent visitor to India, I had the distinct privilege of spending time with Dhirubhai Ambani both at his office in South Bombay and his lovely residence. He was a gentleman of immediate warmth. A modest man who did not discuss his achievements or his generosity towards his employees, his community and his country, Dhirubhai Ambani immediately made me feel as through we had been friends for a long time.Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues join me in expressing condolences to Dhirubhai Ambani's two sons, Mukesh and Anil, who have taken over the management of Reliance, as well as his widow, Kokilaben, and his two daughters. Although they have suffered a great loss, their loss is shared, not only by India's citizens, but by many friends of India in the Congress and throughout the United States.",

Unfortunately, many of us are painfully aware. Many, if not all of us have known someone who has fought against this devastating disease. I would like to express my deep appreciation to the many soldiers in the battle against breast cancer. There are too many to name right now, but their dedication and tireless efforts are critical and so deeply appreciated by us all.A recent study found that the presence of mutated BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 genes made cancer risk soar. This information proves that passage of legislation such as the Genetic Non-Discrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act is imperative. Mr. Speaker, I am a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation, which has 230 cosponsors. By not acting on this legislation, we are placing women's health in jeopardy on a daily basis. Women are not being tested because they fear they will be discriminated against by their insurer should they test positive. This is unconscionable.This body has begun the job of funding the National Institutes of Health and cancer research over the past five years. However, our work is not done. It is imperative that we are able to fund new research and continue existing research. In order to ensure that progress is not lost and valuable information left uncovered, we must continue to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health. One of the things I am most proud to have motivated and enacted was the establishment of the Long Island Breast Cancer Study, a comprehensive effort to investigate whether environmental factors are responsible for breast cancer. The historic investigation began in 1993, and was coordinated by the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. When the study was released late last year, I was disappointed to find the study could not identify specific environmental factors from among the three compounds studied as a cause for breast cancer. Many of the other compounds remain to be ruled out; more funding and research are necessary. However, the lessons learned proved very important. Many of the results provided clues for future research. We must build on this information, we must try until we succeed because the alternative is much more costly.We need to work together to turn ``A-wareness'' into ``A-cure.''",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution and I thank the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on the Middle East and Central Asia for her leadership in bringing H. Res. 615 to the floor. As an original cosponsor of this resolution I am very pleased that the House will, I hope, pass the resolution by an overwhelming, if not unanimous vote.Israel's isolation at the United Nations puts the lie to claims that Israel is not held to a double standard and demonstrates clearly that many of those urbane diplomats who like to talk about peace and reconciliation cannot even stomach the thought of Israel taking its rightful place at the U.N. While space is reserved and rights are held for such pariah states as junta-led Myanmar, dictator-ruled North Korea, the tyranny of the mullahs in Iran and the Palestinians' own thugocracy, democratic Israel is uniquely isolated at what is supposed to be the forum for all nations to deal with each other on equal terms.Ironically, every day, because of the hostility and prejudice that precludes Iraeli participation in the Asia regional group, the credibility and mission of the United Nations is undermined by exactly those states that call most vigorously for the Arab-Israeli conflict to be resolved in accordance with the will of the United Nations. The stench of this hypocrisy easily reaches Washington all the way from U.N. headquarters in New York City.The resolution before the House calls for renewed efforts by this Nation to secure for Israel full membership in the Western Europe and Others Group at the U.N. the membership bloc our own country belongs to. Such a step is entirely appropriate given the close ties between Israel and the other nations in the bloc, as well as shared values and belief in democracy that characterizes this group's membership at the Thanks in large measure to the United States, Israel has, for a short time, been able to enjoy at least partial membership in the WEOG regional group. It is time for this half-measure to be replaced with a lasting and definite full membership. Israel is a country of far greater economic, political and scientific achievement than many of those nations that have obstructed full Israeli participation in the UN. It is more than past time that this grotesque form of discrimination be ended.I urge Members to show their strong support for Israel and the true ideals of the UN by voting in favor of the resolution.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Rotary International, the world's first service club, and to mark the 52nd year of the Rotary Club of Great Neck.Since their establishment on February 23, 1905, by Paul P. Harris, the members of Rotary International have been completely dedicated to fulfilling the goal of their motto: service above self. Over the past 100 years, Rotarians have been providing humanitarian services in communities, workplaces, and throughout the world. In doing so, Rotarians have developed numerous community service projects that assist communities in responding to the critical issues they face, including hunger, poverty, illiteracy, vocational and career development, the environment, and protecting at risk children.The popularity of Rotary International has quickly spread throughout the world, with clubs forming across the United States and on six continents. Currently, there are approximately 1.2 million Rotarians who belong to more than 31,000 Rotary clubs in 166 different countries.The Rotary Club of Great Neck was chartered in 1953, and since then their members have been very active in local and international humanitarian projects. Each November, the Rotary Club of Great Neck holds a Thanksgiving Turkey Drive, where volunteers pack more than 26 tons of food into complete Thanksgiving dinners and distribute them to needy families in the New York metropolitan area. The Great Neck club is also very active in the Gift of Life Program, which provides life saving open-heart surgery to needy children across the world, at no cost to them or their families. Great Neck Rotarians also work with and mentor local students on a weekly basis, teaching them about the joys of giving back to the community and assisting the students with their own service projects.Mr. Speaker, I commend Rotary International, the Rotary Club of Great Neck, and Rotarians across the world for their continued and dedicated service. These fine men and women selflessly volunteer their time to help make our world a better place, and their contributions are immeasurable. I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to please join me in honoring Rotary International as they celebrate their 100th anniversary.",

Andre, the Psychiatric Services Coordinator at the Margaret Tietz Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Jamaica, New York, was inspired by his experiences working with aging individuals suffering from serious health problems.On his way from San Francisco to Jamaica, Andre, who himself is nearing retirement age, stopped at various American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging facilities to meet with and inspire staff members and patients alike. Accompanied by family members along the way, Andre has dedicated the ``Ride for the Ages'' to his daughter, Michele, who survived leukemia as a result of a bone marrow transplant from her brother Jean-Daniel.Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I commend Andre Louis for his altruism and dedication to the health of our seniors. He is truly a determined individual and an inspiration to us all.

She joins over 200 Museum Teacher Fellows in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's program, all of whom continue to serve as community leaders in Holocaust education.As a Museum Teacher Fellow, Meryl will create an outreach project to bring Holocaust education to groups outside the walls of the traditional school environment. This may include distance learning, working with adult groups, or conducting programs in schools, the community, or other professional organizations. Mr. Speaker, I cannot stress enough the importance of Holocaust education. We must never forget. We must teach and remember the Holocaust because genocide is real. It is not history, it is reality.Meryl will be returning to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum throughout the year for further training and to report on her outreach project. Once the 2005-06 academic year is over, she will continue to advance American Holocaust education by supporting future fellows, and, of course, continuing to lead the effort in our community.Mr. Speaker, it is with a great pride that I rise to commend Meryl Menashe. Her dedication to Holocaust education, a sad but necessary task, is extraordinary and she is well deserving of her appointment as a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Teacher Fellow.

Madam Speaker, this resolution purports to protect the symbols of Christmas, but what really needs to be protected are not the symbols of Christmas, but rather the spirit of Christmas. The spirit of Christmas demands generosity and goodwill towards others.Instead of legislation that respects the spirit of Christmas, Congress in just these past few weeks has passed a budget that includes mean-spirited attacks on the least of us. For those who are hungry, we are cutting food stamps. For those who are sick, we are cutting Medicaid. For those who are in prison, we are imposing senseless mandatory minimums. For others we are ignoring increases in heating costs and cutting student loans. At the same time we are cutting those programs to help the least of us, we are cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.Madam Speaker, we ought to express our passion for Christmas through deeds, not words; and we should not be distracted from our responsibility to uphold the spirit of Christmas as we consider the effects our actions on the Federal budget will have on the least of us during this holiday season.For these reasons I oppose this resolution.",

Less than a week later, realizing what a great asset Barbara was, the Board of Elections offered her a permanent position. Seven years later, in 1988, the Board once again recognized her outstanding work and promoted Barbara to Administrative Assistant, where she performed masterfully. In June of 1991, she was appointed as Chief Clerk of the Queens Board of Elections. Over the past fourteen years, Barbara has held this post with remarkable poise, leadership and distinction.Despite her hectic career, Barbara has voluntarily served our community through a number of organizations. She is a Past-President of the Knights of Columbus--General Father Sherman Shine Columbiettes, a member of the Queens Historical Society, and Secretary of the Board of Directors of the Mitchell Gardens Co-op.While Barbara has had a distinguished and praiseworthy career at the Board of Elections, and is celebrated as a community leader, her family--her husband of 30 years, Ronald, along with her two daughters, Amanda and Lisa, and two granddaughters, Brianna and Tiffani--remains the source of her greatest pride and inspiration.Mr. Speaker, it is with great satisfaction that I rise to commend Barbara Conacchio.

    "title": "CONGRATULATING ISRAEL'S MAGEN DAVID ADOM SOCIETY",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their assistance in getting this resolution through the committee, and especially note the hard work and determination of my colleague, the chairperson of the subcommittee, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen of Florida. Their support is deeply appreciated.Mr. Speaker, there are very, very few issues that are really just black and white, where there are good guys and there are bad guys. This struggle, the 60-year effort to win membership for Israel's humanitarian society, the Magen David Adom, Israel's Blue Shield of David, into the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, has been such an enterprise.Like all of my colleagues speaking in support of this resolution, I am honored to have been part of that struggle, and am deeply gratified by the clear, indeed overwhelming victory MDA won last month in Geneva. It is a triumph where humanitarian principles overranked politics and bigotry. It is a triumph for the State of Israel and the Jewish people. It is a triumph for patient, cooperative, multilateral diplomacy and especially American leadership. The victory of MDA really illustrates how important American leadership is, and what this Nation can accomplish with determination, tenacity, and a commitment to holding and protecting the moral high ground in international debate.There never was a good argument against MDA. And with that fact came the moral strength and clarity. And with that strength and clarity came this hard-won victory.As Dr. Martin Luther King liked to say, the arc of the universe is long, but it bends towards justice. A lot of people earned a share of the success that occurred in Geneva. Many of us in the House wrote letters, spoke directly with the Red Cross officials in Europe and with officials within the administration to let them know that Congress backed them 100 percent.All we asked in return was, What more we could do to help? Credit is also due to America's diplomats and to America's humanitarians. Secretary Rice's State Department showed again what a force American diplomacy can be in a righteous cause.And the American Red Cross, the American Red Cross alone in the entire world drew a line in the sand, withholding $45 million in dues to the Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies until the MDA won equal treatment. Only the American Red Cross was willing to put its money where its mouth was and to insist that international humanitarian law should not, could not, and now thankfully cannot be used as a tool of discrimination against Israel.This resolution congratulates Israel on the Magen David Adom Society, which is facing a terrible trial right now, with terrorist rockets falling both in northern and southern Israel. Our thoughts and prayers are with them both. The Magen David Adom stands for everything Hezbollah and Hamas reject, the independence of Israel as a sovereign Jewish state, equal treatment and protection for all people, regardless of their faith, and the belief that there are standards of behavior beyond the realm of political convenience, and above all, the value of life over death.Mr. Speaker, in the business of international politics and diplomacy, clear-cut triumphs are few and far between. I am thrilled to be able to celebrate with you today what a bipartisan, bicameral, cross-branch, multinational, public-private effort can do.But what we are here to celebrate principally is a high moral triumph. I want to thank all of those who helped bring us to this great day and to the Magen David Adom, I say yasher koach, and congratulations on this well-deserved and long-overdue victory.I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution.Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/4\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Berkley) and thank her for her leadership in this effort as well.",

    "title": "HONORING FORMER MEMBER OF CONGRESS THOMAS J. MANTON",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the legacy and the record of our distinguished former colleague, Thomas J. Manton, a superb public servant who passed away on July 22nd.Tom Manton was born on November 3, 1932. In many ways, his birth date was symbolic of the man Tom would become. Just as Franklin Delano Roosevelt, elected President a few days later, would usher in a new era of optimism and faith in the American system, Tom Manton lived a life that served as an inspiration to all who believed, and continue to believe, in the American Dream.A young child during the Depression, Tom Manton was a typical son of Irish immigrants, people who came to this country in search of work and a better life for their children. In fact, Tom's father, Tom, Sr., was a laborer here at the United States Capitol. Surely, as he worked to help build the Cannon House Office Building, he must have looked around now and then, seen the grandeur of the place, and dreamed that one day, his son would work there, not as a laborer, but as an elected representative with an office suite in the building. This most American of dreams, in fact, came true.Tom attended St. Joseph's School in Astoria, Queens, and St. John's Prep in Brooklyn; he earned an undergraduate degree and, by going to school at night, a law degree from St. John's University. When his country needed him, Tom Manton served as a Flight Navigator in the U.S. Marine Corps. He then continued to serve his Nation and community by becoming a New York City Police Officer.In 1970, Tom was elected to the New York City Council, where he continued his work to safeguard the welfare of his fellow citizens. He would continue in this position for fourteen years. In 1984, Tom seized the opportunity to represent his community in the U.S. House of Representatives when he won the election to succeed Democratic vice-presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro.Two years later, Tom became the Chairman of the Queens County Democratic organization and immediately began the revitalization of the local party. Tom took the reins at a time when the party was racked with front-page problems and a loss of public trust. Not only did he turn the party organization around and bring it back to full health, but in doing so, he insisted on making its membership more diverse and more reflective of the diversity of our beloved borough of Queens.Tom's passion for equality took form in his commitment to helping new political leaders of varying ethnic backgrounds achieve impressive firsts. He helped elect the first Latino from Queens to the New York State Assembly; the first Chinese-American to the City Council; the first woman to serve as Borough President; and then the first African-American woman to Borough Presidency; he supported the first Indian-American and Korean-American District Leaders. These are just a few of these achievements.As a direct result of the discipline and commitment he brought to every task, and the tireless work he put into the party, the Queens Democratic Committee is now one of the strongest party organizations in the country. Every Democratic candidate for President, going back to Michael Dukakis, sought Tom out, knowing that without his support, the votes of Queens Democrats would be few and far between.As a congressman, Tom was a bull-dog-like advocate for New York's interests. He won a seat on the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and used his influence to bring jobs and opportunity to his constituents. He fought for critical improvements in the Superfund program to accelerate the cleanup of toxic waste sites. He also took the lead in improving the conservation of our Nation's fisheries and ocean resources as chairman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries Management. He used his experience as a former member of the NYPD to ensure that police officers across the Nation--and their families--would receive fitting lifetime compensation in the event of permanent job-related injuries. He was a Member's Member, constantly working behind the scenes to assist his colleagues, helping to rescue stuck legislation, or cutting deals that made everyone feel like a winner.Having lived the American Dream himself, Tom worked ceaselessly to safeguard the opportunity for everyone, native born and immigrant alike, to live the American Dream as well. Tom was tough, but Tom was fair. And respect for Tom was universal, and went beyond ideology or partisan boundaries.Tom never forgot his roots. He played a tireless and crucial role in helping to bring peace to Northern Ireland. He served as co-chair of the bipartisan Irish Caucus. He was selected to be the Grand Marshal of the New York City Saint Patrick's Day Parade, something of which I know he was proud.With Tom Manton's passing, we have lost one of the classic old school Irish politicians that New York has sent to Washington to look after the interests of ordinary Americans. Tom was a guy who was decent and honest. His word and handshake were his bond. Tom worked quietly behind the curtain, rather than grandstanding in front of the cameras. Tom was a stand-up guy, the real deal.When Tom Manton entered Congress in 1985, I had been serving in Congress for little more than a year. All of us in the New York delegation turned to Tom for advice and guidance. Tom made a difference in the lives of everyone who knew him, and his efforts improved this country for every one of its citizens.My heartfelt condolences go out to Tom's widow, Diane, his children, and grandchildren. He loved them dearly and they love him still. Like many of my colleagues, I will miss Tom. I will miss his wise counsel and his unquenchable passion for our community and its people. America and New York have lost a truly good man and a great public servant.",

In 1997, Mayor Giuliani appointed him to a six-year term as a member of The Trust for Cultural Resources of the City of New York. He was also a member of the Mayor's Advisory Council for Theatre.Mr. Richards served on the President's Council for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, and is on the Board of Directors of Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. In 1994, in memory of his wife, he established the Mary Lea Johnson Richards Institute at New York University Medical Center for organ transplantation and research, and in 1995, also in memory of his wife, he co-founded the Children's Advocacy Center of Manhattan, New York City's only non-profit center for abused children. For the past eight years he has produced the annual Red Ball, one of New York's premiere charitable events, which benefits both the Institute and the Advocacy Center.Martin Richards' life is a living example of the expression that one man can truly make a difference.

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, and yield myself such time as I may consume.Let me first thank the distinguished ranking member of the Africa and Global Health Subcommittee, my very good friend, Chris Smith, for his long-standing leadership in the fight against torture. I am very proud to be a cosponsor of this very important piece of legislation before us today.The Torture Victims Relief Act of 1998 is a landmark piece of legislation that enshrines the fundamental commitment of this Nation to assist all survivors of torture, wherever and whoever they might be.The programs supported by the TVRA combat the effects of the most despicable of all human rights violations: The increasing use of torture around the world.Although exact figures are difficult to ascertain, according to Amnesty International, a well-respected defender of human rights, more than 150 countries worldwide still engage in torture.An estimated 400,000 to 500,000 foreign torture victims reside in the United States, and over 100 million may exist worldwide. More than 250 treatment centers operate internationally with the sole purpose of providing medical, psychological and social services to torture survivors. These crucial facilities provide a distinctive type of treatment to those victims.In the U.S., the Center for Victims of Torture, located in Minnesota, was the first of its kind in the United States and the third torture victims treatment center in the world.The personal ramifications of torture are beyond the comprehension of those who have not gone through it. Torture leaves no victim unscarred. It shapes the remainder of their lives. While physical wounds may ultimately heal, torture survivors need ongoing psychological services and therapy to cope with post-traumatic stress that afflicts them daily. Recovering from torture is a long-term process. It can take years before torture survivors can once again feel emotionally stable and comfortable in society.The bill before the House today funds our very important fight against torture, both nationally and internationally. For international programs, this legislation authorizes $12 million per year for centers and programs administered through USAID's Victims of Torture Fund. It also authorizes an additional $12 million a year for centers and programs administered through the U.N. Voluntary Fund for the Victims of Torture.Domestically, our legislation authorizes $25 million annually for the Department of Health and Human Services so that HHS can assist domestic treatment centers fully and sufficiently.The sad truth is that torture is not waning; if anything, it is on the rise. As a moral force and a Nation that exhibits empathy to those in most need, it is our firm responsibility to help the victims of torture with these comprehensive programs. The funds authorized are urgently needed to achieve this goal. I strongly support this legislation, and encourage every Member of the House to do so as well.Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

The Rabbi and Elaine will be the Guests of Honor at the Seudas Shabbos of Congregation Ohr Moshe in Hillcrest, New York, on May 12, 2007, where they will be honored for their lifelong community service. They will celebrate this joyous occasion surrounded by family and friends.The Strasbergs have been leaders in their community for more than three decades. Rabbi Michael led the Israel Center of Hillcrest Manor for 30 memorable years, during which he performed the B'nai Mitzvah services for my own children. More recently, he joined Congregation Ohr Moshe, which will be honoring the couple at a gala dinner on May 12.The Rabbi Strasberg now works at Sinai Chapels as Director of Pastoral Counseling. In this setting, he provides comfort and strength to families who are going through the trying and painful time of the loss of a loved one. The Rabbi also educates the community with his moving shiurim or lectures on the substance and meaning of the Torah. Michael and Elaine actively participate in community events and organizations on behalf of Sinai Chapels, and work to preserve halacha (Jewish law) and Jewish tradition.Elaine Strasberg is well-known for her superb cooking and enthusiastic leadership of Israeli dance classes for the women in the community. Elaine is also frequently at the top of my mind, as the creator of crocheted yarmulke, which I wear most often. The Strasbergs have always been great supporters of Israel and active in many causes to this end. The Strasbergs take great pride and joy in their family, especially their children and grandchildren. They have five children; daughters Chaya, who is married to Dani; Zahavi, Malka, Rehana, and son Amichai, who is married to Adina. They have four grandchildren and are eagerly anticipating the arrival of the fifth.Madam Speaker, I want to commend Rabbi Michael and Elaine Strasberg for their years of dedicated commitment to the Flushing and Jamaica communities and their residents.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, from time to time, I've heard some of our colleagues wondering why there are so many resolutions about Israel, and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Why, they may wonder, do we have to take up these issues? Doesn't everyone already know that the Congress supports Israel? And it's true, American support for Israel is overwhelming, it is bi-partisan, and it is nearly universal in Congress. But sadly, we are the exception in the world.Around the globe, there have been protests going on about the situation in Gaza. What may not be known is that these demonstrations are not about the rockets that have been falling on Israeli civilians. These protests are not against Hamas. These protests are not about the absurdity of expecting Israel to provide electricity and fuel to the people attacking them.These protests are against Israel and its right of self-defense. They are against demanding that Hamas stop the terror. They are against putting responsibility on the shoulders of Hamas for the welfare of the people in Gaza.To us, in the United States, such protests seem perverse. People who intentionally fire artillery rockets at civilians are properly called ``war criminals.'' People who deliberately seek the death of the innocent are not called ``militants,'' or ``activists,'' or ``guerillas.'' They are properly called ``terrorists,'' and it is hard for us to imagine that these are not universal beliefs.But they're not. What we have seen in the past, and are seeing again is an offensive and deplorable double standard: Every nation is obliged to protect its citizens--except the Israelis; they should be patient and exercise restraint. Every nation is entitled to fight terrorism--except the Israelis; they should have a dialogue with the people who call for their extermination. Every nation is entitled to use force defend itself--except the Israelis; they should only use force if there won't be civilian casualties.Mr. Speaker, we all mourn the loss of innocent life, and the sympathy of decent people is not limited by nationality. The American people are concerned about both Israeli and Palestinian lives. But that concern is not a excuse to dispense with judgement. There is guilt and there is innocence; and there is aggression and there is self-defense. Refusal to acknowledge, or to insist on these distinctions is not only immoral, but dangerous.And that is why the business in Gaza is the business of this House. America, as a leader among the community of nations, has an obligation to stand up in defense of certain values. And it is never so essential to do so than when those values are under attack, and that is what is happening right now.That is why we have to condemn Hamas. That is why we have to condemn the rockets that are still falling on Israeli towns and cities. That is why we have to stand with a democratic ally. That is why we have to declare again and again from this house that the people of Israel--no less than any other people--are entitled to live in peace and security. Certainly we Americans would accept nothing less for ourselves.",

Brumidi's awesome, inspiring murals and frescos are remarkable as they are ubiquitous. Constantino Brumidi's works can be found in three Senate Appropriations Committee rooms, the House Appropriations Committee room, the Senate Democratic Policy Committee room, the Brumidi corridors, the Senate reception area, the Office of the Vice President and, of course, the Rotunda. Like his masterful works throughout the Capitol, Constantino Brumidi's story is uniquely American.Brumidi was born in Rome in 1805 to an Italian mother and a Greek father. His artistic ability was cultivated at an early age. In his early years, he was commissioned to paint frescos and murals in various Roman palaces. And then in 1849, as did so many of our ancestors, Brumidi, who was already an established artist in Italy and who spent 3 years working for Pope Gregory XVI in the Vatican, migrated to the United States and began a new life in New York City. There he proudly became a naturalized American citizen in 1852.It was on a return trip from Mexico that Constantino Brumidi first saw the U.S. Capitol. It was a fortuitous twist of fate: at a time when Congress and President Franklin Pierce were preparing to expand the Capitol, a word-class Italian American artist, who just happened to be passing through Washington, inspired by both the freedoms and liberties represented by the seat of Congress and the vast open spaces in the Capitol that seemed to invite frescos and murals, offered his services to Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs. Wisely, Meigs commissioned Brumidi to become the artist of the Capitol.Brumidi's first work was in the Agricultural Committee room. This masterpiece received such favorable attention that he was given a raise and tasked with painting other larger works culminating with the works in the Capitol Rotunda.There is no work in the Capitol more impressive or more renowned than ``The Apotheosis of Washington.'' Brumidi completed the fresco in 11 months at the end of the Civil War, soon after the new dome was completed. This absolutely stunning work soars 180 feet above the Rotunda floor. To compensate for the distance from the floor to the ceiling, Brumidi, who spent years mastering depth and scale, painted 15-foot tall figures so that the work could be appreciated from the Rotunda floor.Another Brumidi masterpiece, ``The Frieze of American History,'' appears just underneath the dome and spans the entire 360 degrees of the Capitol Rotunda. The frieze, which initially looks to be carved or sculpted, as all who view it believe it to be three dimensional, was, in actuality, meticulously painted with the use of scaffolding. While Brumidi first sketched a design of the frieze in 1859, Congress did not authorize work to begin on this piece until 18 years later, in 1877.The work masterfully displays America's history, beginning with the landing of Christopher Columbus and continuing to the discovery of gold in California. While many visitors to the Capitol have seen Brumidi's genius in the frieze over the years, they may not realize that he nearly lost his life while painting it. While working on a figure of William Penn, 76-year-old Brumidi fell from the scaffolding, but saved himself by clinging to the rung of a ladder for 15 long minutes before he was rescued. While he subsequently ascended the scaffolding once more to continue his work, he died a few months later in 1880. It took two additional artists and 73 years to finish the masterpiece that Constantino Brumidi first began.Mr. Speaker, Constantino Brumidi's service to the Capitol, and our country, span the administration of six, six Presidents: Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes. On and on, Brumidi worked. All of us here in the Capitol that have the privilege of working in this living museum, as well as the millions of visitors that tour our building each year, who admire and relish Brumidi's works, but precious few know the story of the artist of the Capitol.In addition to awarding Constantino Brumidi with the Congressional Gold Medal, S. 254 directs the Architect of the Capitol to display the gold medal as an exhibition in the new visitor's center dedicated to Brumidi's life and work. I believe such an exhibit is long past due and would be to the benefit of future generations of Americans who come to see the Capitol and admire the brilliant works of Constantino Brumidi, reminding us yet again that we are a Nation built by immigrants.Mr. Speaker, Constantino Brumidi was a great son of Italy and a great American. His achievements are a great source of pride for Italian Americans, and S. 254 would bestow Brumidi, and the Italian American community, with the recognition the artist's great contributions so rightly deserve.Special thanks are due to Representative Bill Pascrell from New Jersey, the main sponsor of this bill that we have before us in the House today.And I'd like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of somebody who visits us here in the gallery today, Mr. Speaker, Joseph Grano, who's the president of the Constantino Brumidi Society, for his long and tireless efforts on this behalf.Mr. Speaker, this is a great day for those who love fine art, creativity, American history, and who appreciate the contributions of Italian American immigrants and all immigrants for the culture and history of our country.I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Dale Leon Vincent, Jr., an outstanding father, brother, husband, and a friend to many. Regrettably, Dale passed away earlier this year and left us too soon.Dale's life was devoted to his family, his country, and his community. These values were instilled in him at an early age. His father, Dale L. Vincent, Sr., was a career officer in the Chemical Corps of the U.S. Army, serving in the European theater during World War II, and assisting U.S. humanitarian efforts after the liberation of Nazi concentration camps. Despite constantly moving from school to school each time his father's orders changed, Dale was a model student who devoted himself to his studies and to serving others. Dale reached the highest level of the Boy Scouts, becoming an Eagle Scout and earning the God and Country award. After graduating with honors from Washington-Lee High School in Arlington, Virginia, where he was a highly ranked member of the wrestling team, Dale attended Duke University and became a member of the Delta Sigma Phi fraternity. At Duke, Dale would meet the love of his life, Kathy Sarah Farmer.Following his father's example of service, Dale volunteered for service in the U.S. Army and served honorably in Vietnam. Although, like many veterans, Dale did not like to discuss his experiences in Vietnam, he was greatly admired by his family and friends for volunteering to serve his country despite the great risks. Dale was a first lieutenant in the Signal Corps, received an Army Commendation Medal for service as an instructor at Fort Benning, and, later, a Bronze Star for service in Vietnam. Upon returning home, Dale earned an MBA at American University in Washington, DC, and married his college sweetheart, Kathy.Dale became a successful businessman and entrepreneur in New York City, where he formed a number of companies and displayed a talent for innovation. Over the years, Dale created and ran two successful retail chains, Clubmart and Dress to the Nines. He owned a restaurant in New Hope, Pennsylvania, called ``The Raven,'' managed technology investing at Associated Capital, and was CEO of Mangosoft, a leading software company.Despite Dale's tremendous success as a businessman, his family was his greatest pride. Dale and Kathy raised and were devoted parents to three children, James, Paul, and David. Dale's younger brothers both so looked up to him that they each became Eagle Scouts, went to Duke University, joined Delta Sigma Phi, and served in the U.S. Armed Forces, as well.Dale Vincent's impact on those he shared his life with is truly immeasurable, but is apparent in the family and friends that love him so dearly. For his outstanding devotion to family, friends, and country, I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to please join me in honoring Dale Leon Vincent, Jr.",

    "text": "Madam Chair, I rise today in support of the Murphy Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act to repeal ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell.''The time to end this absurd policy is long past due. Since it was implemented in 1994, ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' has resulted in more than 13,000 gay and lesbian servicemembers being discharged for no reason other than their sexual orientation. As the United States has fought wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq, hundreds of mission-critical troops, including crucial Arabic and Farsi linguists, have been discharged because the Department of Defense believed they were gay. Such blatant discrimination is both morally wrong and, from a practical perspective, self-defeating.Last year, I received a letter from a gay soldier from Long Island who has bravely served our nation for more than twenty years in two branches of our military. Throughout his numerous tours of duty in Afghanistan and in Iraq, he has earned multiple bronze stars. Although he could retire, he did not want to leave the military when our nation needed him most. So, he volunteered for another combat zone deployment.In his letter, this soldier told me that he has served side-by-side with gay soldiers from the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia and has seen no evidence to suggest that these nations, which have no discriminatory policies against gay and lesbian servicemembers, have a problem with unit cohesion. In fact, an openly gay officer from Australia with whom he served was decorated with a U.S. medal at the end of his tour.This soldier concluded by asking if, after looking at his service record, I thought the military and our nation would be better off without his service. My answer is absolutely not. I thank him for his service and proudly cast my vote to allow him and all other gay and lesbian servicemembers to continue their service to our nation without living in fear of being discharged for simply being who they are. Our service men and women deserve a policy that honors the principles they protect. I stand with our nation's principles. I support the Murphy amendment.",

    "title": "NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011",
    "text": "Madam Chair, several months ago I received a letter from a solider who lives in New York. The letter was very similar to those that many members of Congress receive from brave servicemen and women who reside in their districts. The letter spoke of multiple tours through Iraq and Afghanistan, of volunteering for more service even after completing enough tours to retire, and of the pride of a soldier who loves his country and is willing to sacrifice so much to defend it.But this letter was not quite the same as those that many of us here in the Capitol receive from time to time. You see, despite serving his country for more than 20 years, despite volunteering to serve in a combat zone to defend America's principles of freedom from tyranny and from persecution, and despite receiving two bronze stars for meritorious service to his country, the gay soldier who wrote this letter is required by United States law to lie about who he is or face being discharged from the military.For 16 years, ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' has placed an unthinkable and immoral burden on gay and lesbian servicemen and women, who, under United States law and unlike their heterosexual counterparts, must hide their sexual orientation and their partners from the military. Their partners are not eligible for the military spousal benefits to which the partners of heterosexual servicemen and women are entitled, including health care and better housing. Madame Speaker, ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' is, by definition, a discriminatory policy.In the course of tonight's debate, several members have characterized the House of Representatives' impending vote to repeal ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' as a step forward for morality and equality. And it is. But, before we collectively pat ourselves on the back for a job well done, I would remind my colleagues that tonight's step forward is only a result of the giant leap backwards we took when we instituted the policy in the first place. Years from now, when our children read about ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' in their history books, what will they think of a government that so shamefully turned its back on gay servicemen and women in the interest of a political compromise?Madam Chair, politics is a business of grays. Seldom do we have the opportunity to vote on legislation that is black or white, moral or immoral, right or wrong. Tonight is the rare exception.For the thousands of gay servicemen and women who so bravely serve our country everyday but who live in constant fear of being discovered for who they are, for the principles of freedom and equality upon which the United States of America was founded, and in the interest of righting a wrong that has persisted for far too long, I rise in support of the amendment before us and for the patriotic soldier whose letter I enclose for the record; a letter in which he implores me: ``If and when this issue ever comes up for debate, and even for a vote in Congress, I respectfully ask you to remember all the gay military personnel who are right now risking our lives to defend the U.S. and its values.''Madam Chair, that moment has come.Dear Congressman Ackerman: I am a captain in the United States Army Reserve, and am presently deployed to Afghanistan. I am writing to you with regard to the military's so-called ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' (DADT) policy. As you may know, there is currently a strong push in Congress to overturn DADT--under which otherwise qualified gay men and women are still being involuntarily dismissed from service-- and replace it with a policy of nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. I strongly support this proposed policy change. I would like to explain the basis for my judgment. I am a veteran of both the U. S. Navy Reserve and the U. S. Army Reserve. In the latter I have served as both a sergeant and as a commissioned officer. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 I have completed tours of duty in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kuwait. I was informed that I had completed twenty good years of Reserve military service, and had thus earned the right to retire. But I did not want to retire with my country still at war. So I volunteered for another combat zone deployment, and am serving once again in Afghanistan. I have been at my current duty station------. I recite this brief resume to let you know that I am no mere observer of the military, but rather someone who has dedicated much of my life to our national defense. Congressman Ackerman, I am also one of the many gay military personnel who have served our country faithfully in these times of terrorism and war. I want to give you my personal perspective on why DADT is so wrong. First of all, it is widely recognized that a married service member's relationship with his or her spouse has a profound impact on that service member's fitness for duty. Thus, straight married service members are free, within the limits of resource availability and operational constraints, to maintain communications with their spouses. In fact, such communication is actively encouraged. Regular phone calls, e- mail, and postal letters really help both the service member and spouse get through the strain of combat zone deployments in particular. Many gay service members have committed partners who, every day, face the same stress and make the same sacrifices as do their straight counterparts. But because of DADT, gay service members and their partners have to constantly worry that an overheard telephone call, an intercepted e-mail message, or other type of compromised communication could lead to a degrading, career-destroying investigation. It is wrong, I believe, to place such additional burdens on the back of American patriots. I write of these matters from personal experience. When the 9/11 terrorist attacks occurred I was in a serious long-term relationship. But the extensive post-9/11 active duty I performed put a serious strain on this relationship. The relationship finally fell completely apart during my first Afghanistan deployment in------. As you may know, the military has seen a troubling increase in the service member suicide rate since 9/11. Furthermore, the loss of a serious relationship is one of the critical risk factors that may contribute to such suicides. I experienced this particular risk factor and my situation was compounded by its occurrence in a war zone. Six years later, I can still vividly remember cradling my government-issue pistol in my hands and fighting the urge to blow my own brains out. I made it through that crisis. I completed my mission in Afghanistan successfully, and in fact was decorated with a Bronze Star Medal at the conclusion of that tour. I went on to earn a second Bronze Star Medal in Iraq two years later, and was promoted to------ shortly after that. What made that crisis particularly difficult was the isolation imposed on me as a result of DADT. A straight Soldier in a comparable crisis could turn to his commander, his first sergeant, or a ``battle buddy'' for help and advice. But such avenues are legally closed to gay troops. If I, for example, had shared the details of my situation with my commander--a decent and honorable man--he would have been legally obligated to have initiated an investigation that would have heaped even more stress upon me, disrupted my unit's mission, and ultimately destroyed my career. I know that many would say that a gay service member in such a situation could go to a chaplain in confidentiality. I have great respect for our military chaplains and for all the good work that they do. But I also believe that no service member should feel forced to see a chaplain as his or her only option. Every service member should have the right to speak freely with a commander, a trusted noncommissioned officer, or a battle buddy. I assert this not only as an individual Soldier, but also as an officer with extensive experience as a platoon leader and company commander. When I have been in these command positions, I have had Soldiers share with me some very personal information about their families and home lives. I was glad that these Soldiers trusted me, and this bond of trust and openness enabled me to give each individual the counsel or moral support that was needed. But what about gay troops? They are legally deprived of such a relationship with a commander, a senior noncommissioned officer, or a battle buddy. This is wrong. These gay troops--especially those experiencing the stress of combat zone duty--deserve access to such relationships. The DADT policy shackles the hands of leaders like myself and prevents us from properly supporting all our troops. This policy puts service members and their loved ones at risk. DADT is a shameful blot on our national honor. I know that many are wary of a repeal of DADT. Perhaps some--particularly those who oppose homosexual conduct on religious grounds--see such a policy change as the equivalent of governmental approval of homosexual conduct. But this is not so. Let me strike an analogy. Many religious individuals are opposed, on biblical grounds, to divorce and remarriage. But persons who have divorced and remarried are plentiful in the armed services, and many serve alongside very conservative religious persons every day. Respecting divorced-and-remarried persons as military professionals does not mean one agrees with their personal life choices, or that the government is advocating such choices. To me, the main issue is that we respect personnel who serve their country honorably and who act with responsibility and integrity in their personal lives. For example, in the military we will punish a ``deadbeat dad'' who neglects to pay his child support, but we support and respect the divorced father who stays committed to his parental responsibilities. I believe that we need to take a comparable stance towards gay service members. There are also some who claim that repealing DADT will negatively impact morale and discipline in our armed services. But I have never seen a single shred of empirical evidence to support such assertions. In fact, the available evidence suggests that treating gay and straight troops equally has no negative impact on military forces. Consider the fact that many of our key allies in current combat and security operations--nations such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia--do not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in their armed services. These fighting forces continue to perform admirably. Furthermore, troops from these and other nondiscriminatory nations live and serve side by side every day with U.S. troops in war zones. On this current tour, for example, I personally have shared living and bathing facilities with uniformed personnel from Australia, Canada, Denmark, Spain, and the United Kingdom-- never have I seen a U.S. serviceman run shrieking from the showers because he feared that he might encounter an openly gay individual from one of these allied nations. Last year I met an openly gay chief petty officer from the Australian navy. He had served as part of a U.S.-led multinational team in Iraq. He told me that not only was his presence no problem for the Americans, but they decorated him with a U.S. medal at the end of his tour! Surely if Americans can accept a gay Australian, they can also accept gay fellow Americans. People who claim that the U.S. military cannot manage a policy of sexual orientation nondiscrimination are not only ignoring the realities of current operations, but they are also essentially saying that American service personnel are less professional than those of the U.K., Canada, and other nondiscriminatory nations--I consider such an assertion to be a highly offensive insult. Of course, my argument ultimately leads to a logical--and fair--question: How do we manage this change in policy? The answer is simple. Hold gay service members to exactly the same standards we hold straight service members. If gay individuals were to commit acts of sexual harassment, or engage in any other type of activity that goes contrary to military order, we would discipline them appropriately--and separate them from the service if necessary. This happens to straight service members when necessary; I myself once had to discipline a straight male noncommissioned officer for his inappropriate behavior towards a junior female Soldier. This NCO accepted my counsel, corrected his behavior, and completed his tour of duty successfully. On the other hand, those gay individuals who conduct themselves with honor and dignity, and who demonstrate respect for their fellow service members, would continue to do their jobs. This is exactly the policy that coalition militaries, many U. S. police departments, and dozens of civilian corporations have been following successfully for years. Are we really to believe that this course of action is beyond the capability of the U.S. military? In fact, I believe that the demise of DADT will happen as smoothly and quietly as did similar policy changes in the militaries of allied nations. Gay troops who have been behaving in a professional manner prior to the demise of DADT are not suddenly going to begin engaging in outrageous or disruptive behavior. Today's gay troops, despite the burdens of DADT, are putting their lives on the line every day to defend this country; many of us have been tested in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, and other challenging locations. If the military gets rid of DADT, we will continue to do our jobs and take care of our battle buddies; we and our commanders will simply have a terrible burden lifted from our shoulders. Congressman, after more than two decades of military service--at sea and on land, from the Cold War era to the Global War on Terror, in joint service and multinational environments--I think I know the women and men of our armed forces pretty well. I can tell you that every day U. S. service members overcome barriers of difference--difference in race, ethnic heritage, religion, regional origin, gender, socioeconomic class, and other areas. Sexual orientation is just another element in this complex equation. We are able to overcome all these types of difference and form cohesive teams by focusing on the basics: mutual respect, a solid work ethic, personal integrity, and commitment to our common missions. We are also able to recognize that a person whose difference may initially unsettle us may also possess a critical skill, a body of knowledge, or a depth of experience that we need to accomplish these common missions. Can we afford to lose a fluent Arabic linguist because she is a lesbian? Can we afford to discard a combat seasoned infantryman because he is gay? I have enclosed with this letter some documentation from my combat zone service. My contributions have been modest compared to the heroism shown by many of my sisters and brothers in arms. Still, I am proud of what I have achieved. I leave it to you to look at my record and determine whether or not the military would be better off if I--and, for that matter, thousands of people like me--were to be involuntarily dismissed from duty. I am an ordinary guy who grew up in New York. My dad is a retired New York City cop who was deeply impacted by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Like any other deployed Soldier, I call my folks at least once a week, and they worry about me just like the parents of any Soldier. I don't want to turn the military into some sort of gay utopia. I just want gay Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen--together with our loved ones--to have the sort of peace of mind that our straight sisters and brothers take for granted. Congressman Ackerman, I read on your Web site about how you stood up for Soldiers who were not getting their combat zone tax exemption in Iraq. So I know you are a leader who believes in taking care of the troops. Sir, I believe that now is the time to give troops like me relief from the injustice of ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell.'' If and when this issue comes up for debate, and even for a vote, in Congress, I respectfully ask you to remember all the gay military personnel who are right now risking our lives to defend the United States and its values. If you have any questions or comments about anything I have written, you may contact me via e-mail. And please feel free to share this letter and its enclosures, including my contact information, with any individuals or organizations whom you deem appropriate. Sincerely, ------.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Meeks amendment, which not only affects his district, but affects at least 11 congressional districts that surround his district, all in support of our veterans and fighting men and women who have returned from wars overseas, some of them severely injured and in need of our care, concern, and support at this very moment.For 7 years now, the Department of Veterans Affairs has pursued a perhaps well-intentioned but a stubbornly wrongheaded plan for the St. Albans Primary and Extended Care facility which is located in the county of Queens. I am very concerned that the VA is proceeding full speed ahead with its plans to lease a property for 34 years, property currently dedicated exclusively for veterans. And what are the veterans supposed to do for the next 75 years without this facility, when there is a rising demand among our veterans for medical services?The justification--you have to hear this--the justification for the VA's decision stems from an absurd outdated report that relied on data from 2003, 8 years ago, when we were only at the beginning of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have, unfortunately, seen tremendous increases in veterans homelessness, foreclosures, divorce, substance abuse, PTSD and, yes, suicides.And yet the VA report from all those years ago projected at that time, almost a decade ago, that mental health services for our veterans was going to decrease over the next 20 years. It's been 8 years since that report. And what have we seen during the 8 years alone? And there's 12 years more to go. We've seen increases in all of these problems among our veterans. And yet they cling stubbornly to the data in that report, thinking that these things are going to go down among our veterans. And this, everybody knows, is certainly not going to be the case.All evidence suggests that returning veterans are going to require a greater significant increase especially in VA mental health services. A Rand Center report alone found that already 18.5 percent of all U.S. servicemembers who have returned already from Afghanistan and Iraq currently suffer from PTSD or depression, and that 19.5 percent suffer from traumatic brain injury.Where is the Veterans Administration's common sense? To give away this property, which is intended and secured right now for our veterans, is a huge mistake, based on a report that is already discredited by the facts. This is something that we can't allow to continue.These are veterans who have sacrificed so much. We have to stand here today on the floor. And I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, colleagues in the majority especially, for seeing through the politics of this and understanding that these are our veterans that we are fighting for; that we, as Members of Congress, understand our constituencies and our needs and their needs.I want to personally thank Representatives Grimm and King, who are among our delegation, as well as the rest of the Democratic members of the delegation in our region, and thank Representative Meeks for his dynamic and great leadership in bringing this to our attention so that we could stand together as patriotic Americans all, at least on this issue, and fight for the needs of our veterans.I yield back the balance of my time.The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks).",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Evelyn Weinstein, beloved mother, grandmother, and wife, tireless advocate for the underprivileged, and friend to all who knew her. Regrettably, Evelyn passed away earlier this week.To say that Evelyn believed in giving back and paying forward would be an understatement--she devoted her entire life to helping the most vulnerable members of our society. The daughter of Polish immigrants, Evelyn worked hard to achieve the American Dream, graduating first from Brooklyn College and then going on to receive a Masters degree from Columbia University. Evelyn used her education and training to help others by becoming a certified psychiatric social worker in New York State.During World War II and its aftermath, she helped veterans and their families cope with the psychiatric issues of war and also assisted children with respiratory ailments. During her four-decade long career as a social worker, she was a stalwart advocate for patients, assisting thousands of them at Jamaica, Long Island Jewish and North Shore hospitals. She was also the director of Long Term Care Ombudservice, Nassau County, safeguarding the rights of nursing-home residents and helping families deal with the difficult transition of placing loved ones into elder-care facilities.Always the ardent activist, Evelyn was involved with many social agencies and organizations dedicated to assisting low income and vulnerable individuals, including: the Nassau Action Coalition, helping the aged and disabled and blind on Social Security Income; the Kimmel Housing Development Foundation, advocating for affordable housing; and the Social Action Committee of Temple Emanuel of Great Neck, serving as its chairperson. Evelyn also received numerous honors for her good works during her long and varied career, including: the American Jewish Congress Woman of the Year award, the Nassau County Social Worker of the Year award, and Nassau County Senior Citizen of the Year award.Evelyn met the love of her life, Jack Weinstein, while she was attending Brooklyn College. They married in 1946 after Jack's service in the U.S. Navy and had three sons, Seth, Michael, and Howard. Jack went on to become a federal district judge, then chief judge, in the Eastern District of New York. But before Jack could become one of the most distinguished jurists in the country, Evelyn worked nights as a social worker and helped care for their young son so that Jack could attend Columbia University law school.Evelyn was known for a lifetime of selfless devotion to her family, friends, coworkers, patients and clients. Her human touch and empathy for those in need led to the bettering of thousands of lives, not just through her own work, but also through her efforts of teaching people how to help people. She trained and supervised hundreds of social workers and volunteer ``ombudspeople'' along the way so that they could continue to ``pay forward'' what Evelyn had ``given back'' to her community. Evelyn was deeply committed to the concept of citizen representatives overseeing and engaging in government programs in their communities.Mr. Speaker, Evelyn's energy and compassion for helping the disadvantaged never wavered, never flagged. She is already sorely missed, but her gift of helping others, as well as inspiring all of us to help those less fortunate than us, will always endure. I ask all of our colleagues to rise and join me in honoring Evelyn Weinstein. ",

As has already been stated, there are no funds for Appalachian highways in the Transportation appropriations bill that passed the House earlier this week.This bill today, the Energy and Water appropriations bill, which has been so well crafted by the chairman, Joseph McDade and the ranking member Vic Fazio, includes $160 million for the Appalachian Regional Commission [ARC]. This bill represents a cut below the President's request and is less than half the amount appropriated 15 years ago. If non-Defense discretionary programs had been reduced like this, we would have a balanced budget this year.It is important to note that since the ARC was created over 30 years ago, the economic condition in the Appalachian Region has significantly improved. Poverty rates have been cut in half, infant mortality has been reduced by two-thirds, and good paying jobs have been created through infrastructure improvements.But our job is not done. Businesses are closing and others refusing to locate in northern Alabama due to the lack of a four-lane highway to connect the cities of Atlanta, Birmingham, and Memphis.For job creation and safety issues this is an unacceptable omission from our National Highway System.Economic growth is hampered because it is so difficult to transport goods and services between Birmingham and Memphis and throughout the northerwestern part of Alabama.The current inadequate two-lane route is extremely dangerous with a traffic incident or fatality occurring every month for the last 50 months.The ARC provides needed funds for highways located in the Appalachian Region like Corridor X, which is the proposed four-lane route from Memphis to Birmingham. These funds do not take resources away from the transportation trust funds, and are matched by each State.I understand the concern of the gentleman from Wisconsin and support eliminating Federal programs that are inefficient and wasteful. However, a closer look at the facts will demonstrate that funding for the ARC is crucial for the infrastructure and economic development of many rural areas including my congressional district.I urge my colleagues to defeat the Klug amendment and support H.R. 2203.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, for many of our country's poorest children, education is their one ticket out of poverty. In fact, even children in truly horrible schools manage to make it out of their destitution by relentless determination and plain old hard work.But, Mr. Speaker, children should not have to pass through metal detectors on their way through the schoolhouse door. If kids are more worried about becoming victims of violence than about getting an ``A'' on the next exam, how can we expect them to perform their best?Mr. Speaker, in the face of school violence and disorderly classrooms, to whom can the kids turn? Why, their parents, of course. But what if their parents lack the resources to pull them out of horrible schools?Mr. Speaker, while the special interests join together in saying too bad or offer up worthless promises, conservatives offer these kids hope in the form of school choice and education savings accounts.Mr. Speaker, hope is a commodity in short supply in many of our Nation's poorest communities. School choice and education savings accounts give kids and their parents a reason to hope.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize two schools in my district that have been recognized by the U.S. Department of Education for their achievements as Title I schools.These schools, Carlisle Elementary Schools in Boaz, Alabama and McCord Elementary School in Albertville, Alabama, were selected for this award through a competitive process coordinated and managed by the state education agency. The principals of these schools, Ms. Kim Mintz and Mr. Richard Cole respectively, deserve this national recognition for their unwavering dedication to the academic achievement of their students.Title I schools are located in high poverty areas and receive funding to improve teacher training and learning for at-risk children. These two schools and the 97 others in the nation that are also receiving these awards, are schools that have far exceeded expectations; they have truly gone the extra mile to give these children a chance to succeed. In turn, these children, supported by their families, have worked hard and set an example for students everywhere.The recognition is based on six criteria: opportunity for all children to meet proficient and advanced levels of performance; professional development for teachers and administrators; coordination with other programs; curriculum development and instruction to support achievement to high standards; partnerships developed among the school, parents, and the local community; and three years of successful achievement and testing data.The awards will be presented on May 2 in Indianapolis at the 2000 International Reading Association Conference. Mr. Speaker, I commend the faculty, staff, parents, and students for making these schools such a landmark of achievement in the State of Alabama.",

    "title": "CARL ELLIOTT FEDERAL BUILDING",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, it has already been stated tonight and it has been stated very eloquently some things about Congressman Carl Elliott, who served as an outstanding representative for Alabama and our Nation throughout his life.He was born to Will and Nora Massey Elliott of Vina, in Franklin County, Alabama, in 1913, and he tirelessly devoted himself to serving others. He was a 1936 graduate of the University of Alabama Law School and he was admitted to the practice in Alabama under the Alabama State Bar the same year. He also set up his law practice in Russellville, Alabama, in 1936 and later moved that practice to Jasper, Alabama, where he later served as judge of the Recorders Court.In June of 1940, Carl Elliott married Jane Hamilton, who remained his wife until her death in 1985. Through their years together, the couple raised four children, Carl, Jr., Martha, John and Lenora.Following military service in the Second World War, Carl Elliott rose quickly in public life and was elected to the 81st and seven succeeding Congresses beginning in 1948.From the first day he came to Washington, Carl Elliott began working on a bill for Federal aid for education. In every Congressional session from 1949 to 1958, Carl Elliott introduced some form of a student aid act, knowing that under the seniority system, his legislation might take years to get a hearing. Despite these challenges, Carl Elliott was undeterred in his strong desire to improve the quality of our Nation's education system, from the elementary and secondary level through higher education in our Nation's colleges and universities. This persistence paid off when he was appointed to the House Committee on Education and Labor in October of 1951, the committee on which Elliott is known for having done his greatest work in the House.But Carl Elliott knew it was not always politically popular for a Congressman to be a champion of our Nation's educational system. In his autobiography, The Cost of Courage, the Journey of an American Congressman, Elliott wrote that ``By stepping into the arena of the fight for Federal aid to education, I was entering a battleground littered with nearly two centuries of corpses. Only twice in America's history had the Federal Government been able to pass laws that significantly and directly provided aid to the Nation's schools. The first was the passage of the Northwest Ordinance in 1787, which set aside public lands for elementary and secondary schools. The second came in 1962, when Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill Act, which provided land grants for state universities.''As chairman of the Education and Labor Subcommittee on Special Education, Carl Elliott saw that wherever he went, he was told the same thing that he had already known for quite some time, that something needed to be done to strengthen our educational system, particularly in the fields of science and technology. This need became dramatically clear in our Nation when Sputnik I was launched by the Soviet Union in October of 1957. With its strange beeping sound heard by millions of Americans as it orbited the Earth that month, Americans realized that there was a tremendous need to increase our scientific and technical knowledge base to win the space race and eventually win the Cold War.When the House convened in 1958, Carl Elliott's number one priority was passage of his bill, the National Defense Education Act. This historic legislation established loans to students at our Nation's colleges and universities, and provided financial assistance for strengthening education by authorizing Federal grants to States to purchase equipment for science and mathematics instruction.The National Defense Education Act helped to strengthen math and science instruction at a critical time in our Nation's race to the Moon and our eventual victory in the Cold War under Presidents Reagan and Bush.Carl Elliott was also responsible for the Library Services Act, which brought libraries to rural communities, and even now provides millions of dollars in Federal assistance for low-income elementary, secondary and college level students.As a member of the House Committee on Rules, Elliott worked for progressive social legislation and took a stand on racial issues during a time in the South when such a stand was anything but popular.Despite his Congressional defeat in 1964, Carl Elliott continued his career in public life, serving as a member of President Johnson's Library Commission in 1967 and 1968. He also served under Presidents Johnson and Nixon as Chairman of the Public Evaluation Committee, Office of Technical Services, and a member of the Technical Advisory Board within the Department of Commerce.Although elected and appointed to high office throughout his career, Elliott never forgot his roots, resuming his law practice in Jasper until his death on January 9 of last year. Two of Elliott's children, Martha Elliott Russell and Lenora Russell Cannon, who currently live in Jasper, are still living today, and also I just found out today that his grandson, William Russell, is working now on Capitol Hill.In 1990, Carl Elliott was given what is perhaps the greatest honor of his career when he was named the first recipient of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. Created by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation to encourage elected officials to show courage in their political leadership, more than 5,000 people were nominated, but only one person was chosen, and that was Carl Elliott.In his autobiography, Carl Elliott himself best summed it up, and, as the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) eloquently put it tonight and it is the way he said it best in his book in the Profile in Courage speech, ``There were those who said that I was ahead of my time. But they were wrong. I believe that I always was behind the times that ought to be.''To honor Carl Elliott's long and distinguished career, I am proud to introduce H.R. 4806 to designate the Federal building located at 1710 Alabama Avenue in Jasper, Alabama, as the Carl Elliott Federal Building. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. I believe it will serve as a fitting tribute to a great leader who truly made a difference in making the lives of Americans in his era and in our own better than they would have been without his leadership.I had an opportunity to personally know Carl Elliott. As a college student I was working on a term paper and I went to see the former Congressman to discuss the topic that I was working on, the history of Winston County. He sat down with me, he was helpful, he was sincere, and he took time to help a student who needed his help.It is only fitting and proper that we honor Carl Elliott through this legislation.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise today to oppose the amendment by the gentlemen from Arizona and Michigan, both fine and excellent Members of this body, but like many Americans, I am concerned that gambling is a panacea for the real problems of poverty on Indian reservations. As gambling has become more and more a part of Native American policy, investment in Federal programs intended to improve the health and welfare of tribes has declined.While the intent of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was to allow Native Americans to lift themselves out of poverty through self-reliance, today nearly 80 percent of Native Americans do not receive anything from gambling revenues. The reality is that most tribes, which are located in areas not economically viable for a casino, live in poverty.The National Indian Gaming Commission, which is now in the bill, would be struck by this amendment. This would be unfortunate because the Indian Gaming Commission would undertake a study of a number of problems which impact the Native American community, including the welfare of Native Americans, including health, infrastructure, housing, economic development and educational opportunities; the relationship between tribal entities and nontribal communities; and regulations that govern tribal gaming to produce potential for abuse or exploitation by organized crime and the gaming industry.This commission, I believe, provides a much-needed review of Federal policy on Native Americans. Given the current state of affairs, I urge my colleagues to preserve the National Indian Gaming Commission and to oppose the Hayworth-Kildee amendment.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the work of a great American, Phyllis Schlafly. Mrs. Schlafly was named one of the 100 most important women of the 20th century by the Ladies' Home Journal, and has been a national leader of the conservative movement since the publication of her bestselling 1964 book, A Choice Not An Echo.Mrs. Schlafly has been a leader of the pro-family movement since 1972, when she started her national volunteer organization now called Eagle Forum. In a ten-year battle, she led the profamily movement to victory over the principal legislative goal of the radical feminists, called the Equal Rights Amendment. An articulate and successful opponent of the radical feminist movement, she appears in debate on college campuses more frequently than any other conservative.Mrs. Schlafly's monthly newsletter called The Phyllis Schlafly Report is now in its 36th year. Her syndicated column appears in 100 newspapers, her radio commentaries are heard daily on 460 stations, and her radio talk show on education called ``Phyllis Schlafly Live'' is heard weekly on 45 stations. Both can be heard on the internet.In addition, she is the author or editor of 21 books on subjects as varied as family (The Power of the Positive Woman) and feminism (Feminist Fantasies), nuclear strategy (Strike From Space and Kissinger on the Couch), education (Child Abuse in the Classroom), and child care (Who Will Rock the Cradle?). Her recent book, Turbo Reader, is a system to enable every parent to teach his child to read.Mrs. Schlafly is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Washington University, received her J.D. from Washington University Law School, and received her Master's in Political Science from Harvard University. She is a lawyer who served on the Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution appointed by President Reagan, has testified before more than 50 Congressional and State Legislative committees on constitutional, national defense, and family issues.The mother of six children and an Illinois Mother of the Year, Mrs. Schlafly is America's best-known advocate of the dignity and honor that we as a society owe to the role of fulltime homemaker.Phyllis Schlafly was honored in 2002 by Focus on the Family as the Mother of the Profamily Movement, and in 2003) she was the honoree at dinners hosted by the Council for National Policy and the Conservative Political Action Committee. She has since 1972 traveled at least annually to Alabama to debate and speak eloquently on issues that affect the family.The Alabama Policy Institute, Christian Coalition of Alabama, and the Southeast Law Institute have joined the Eagle Forum of Alabama to honor Mrs. Schlafly and express their admiration, appreciation, and affirmation of her exemplary service to God, family and country. As President Ronald Reagan said: ``Our nation needs the kind of volunteer service you and Eagle Forum have demonstrated . . .'' And as American Conservative Union Chairman David Keene said in a statement this year about Mrs. Schlafly: ``If there are giants among us, you are certainly one. The movement of which we are all part would never have achieved the successes it has without you . . . you had the courage to be `conservative before it was cool'. . . the fact that so many young people are attracted to our banner today is a tribute to your work.''I stand with these groups and individuals to honor Phyllis Schlafly for her service to our country and culture, and her commitment to conservative family values.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today we are considering, as has already been said, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. I have joined with 161 Members in cosponsoring this legislation, and I commend the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) for bringing forward this legislation. This is the fifth Congress during which this debate has taken place, four of which I have been a part of, and I believe an overwhelming majority of Americans hope this will be the last and that we will pass this bill and have it sent to the President and signed into law.I know that it has been repeated time and time again here on the floor of the House, but this afternoon I think it is important to remind my colleagues of the details of this deplorable procedure. Partial-birth abortion is a procedure in which the mother's cervix is forcibly dilated over a 3-day period. On the third day the child is pulled feet first through the birth canal until his or her entire body, except for the head, is outside the womb. While the fetus is stuck in this position, dangling partly out of the mother's body and just a few inches from taking its first breath, the physician inserts and opens scissors into the base of the baby's skull, creating a hole in the baby's head.The physician then either crushes the baby's skull with instruments or suctions out the baby's brain. With the head now small enough to slip through the mother's cervix, the physician pulls the now-lifeless body the rest of the way out of its mother, and discards the baby's body as medical waste. Today you will hear some supporters of partial-birth abortion claim this procedure is a critical alternative that must remain legal to protect women's health. However, the medical profession offers no support for such claims.I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill to protect the most vulnerable in our Nation.",

    "title": "TRIBUTE TO STATE REPRESENTATIVE ALLEN LAYSON",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor State Representative Allen Layson on the occasion of his retirement from the Alabama House of Representatives. Allen is a man who embodies the American principles of hard work, dedication to one's family and service to one's country. I am honored to stand before this body of Congress and this Nation to recognize his many accomplishments.Allen was born on December 16, 1931 in Eatonton, Georgia. He graduated from Eatonton High School in 1947. He entered the United States Army Reserves in 1948 and volunteered for active duty service in 1951 and was discharged in 1953. Immediately after leaving the Army, Allen attended the University of Georgia and earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in Forestry in just three years, graduating in 1956.Allen and his family moved to Pickens County in 1969, and he soon demonstrated his outstanding leadership to the Reform community. He served as president of the Reform Rotary Club, is the founder of the Reform Area Public Library, is a member of the American Legion, a member of the Pickens County Mental Health Association, a Master Mason, and a member of the Boy Scout Troop Committee. First elected to the Alabama House of Representatives in 1986, Allen has served the Sixty-First district with distinction for the past twenty years. During his tenure he was a strong proponent of our Second Amendment rights and worked hard to protect the family and our religious liberties. A social and fiscal conservative, he voted consistently to ensure that Alabama provided an economic atmosphere in which business and industry could grow and prosper.Allen is a true friend of the volunteer fire fighter. Through his efforts, a three mil revenue tax was enacted in 1999, and amended in 2004, to provide badly needed funding to the volunteer fire departments in Pickens County. This funding allows the volunteer fire departments to purchase equipment, provide training and cover operating costs. This has greatly enhanced their firefighting capabilities, thus reducing insurance rates and thereby saving money for Alabama families.He served as a Commissioner on the Alabama Forestry Commission from 1979 to 1983, served as president of the Alabama Division for the Society of American Foresters, is a Trustee of the Alabama Forest Products Workman's Compensation Fund, served as president and is a lifetime member of the Alabama Wildlife Federation, is a member of the Alabama Cattlemen's Association, a member of the Sierra Club and a member of sixteen volunteer fire departments. Also, Allen has served on the board of directors for the Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway Development Authority since his appointment by Governor Guy Hunt in 1991.He has been distinguished as the recipient of the Governor's Conservationist of the Year Award in Forestry in 1982, the Kelly Mosley Environmental Award in 1985 and the APA Southwestern United States Technical Writing Award in 1981.Of all of Allen's accomplishments, perhaps his greatest achievement was convincing the former JoAnn Kimberly to marry him. They were married on September 15, 1949 and are the proud parents of five children; Butch, Allen, Jr., Kim, James and Michael. Allen and JoAnn are faithful members of Reform First United Methodist Church where Allen has served as a Lay Leader and Lay Speaker.Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege to honor State Representative Allen Layson for his many achievements and his enduring impact on his country, state, community, friends and family. He is a man of great dignity and character who takes pride in the accomplishments of those he has helped over the years. Allen is an inspiring role model for all of us and I join his family, friends and colleagues in wishing him God's richest blessings in his retirement.",

    "title": "TRIAL OF WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
    "text": "Mr. Chief Justice and esteemed colleagues, I rise to offer my thoughts on the momentous decision we will render shortly. At the start, I deeply regret that the American people have been denied the opportunity to hear the Senate's final deliberations on the impeachment charges against President Clinton. I say this because I have been thoroughly impressed with the thought, tenor, and passion brought to this deliberation by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I wish the American people could have the opportunity to observe what I have had the privilege of witnessing for the past two days. Whether seated in the gallery, watching on television, listening on radio, or following on-line, the public would have benefitted tremendously from the opportunity to hear, in real time and full context each of our remarks. The opportunity to read a transcript later this week in the Record will not come close to viewing these proceedings. It lacks the power of the moment.when I took the oath to do impartial justice on January 7, 1999, I knew, as one of 100 Senators, that I was assuming the unique role of judge and juror in the Senate impeachment trial of William Jefferson Clinton. Over these weeks, I have listened to the presentations by the House Managers, the White House counsel, and the President's defense team without prejudice. I have analyzed the video testimony of Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan, and Sidney Blumenthal, and read numerous grand jury transcripts, the referral from the Independent Counsel, and the House report and related documents.The House of Representatives approved two articles of impeachment by straight party line votes after bitter and divisive partisan debate, forwarding to the Senate the impeachment articles to remove the President of the United States as authorized by the Constitution. At the same time, the partisan nature of the House action invites challenge to its legitimacy. And, although we have more often than not voted along party lines during the impeachment trial, I am proud of this body and its genuine effort to pursue a bipartisan course during our trial of the President. We have disagreed without being disagreeable.The body has not strayed too far from the comity and tone that marked our first bipartisan caucus to set the framework for this proceeding.We have taken the admonition of the senior Senator from West Virginia to heart and avoided descending into the pit of caustic partisanship and recrimination.After reviewing volumes of evidence and weighing weeks of presentations before the Senate, I have concluded that a case has not been made on either of the articles of impeachment against President Clinton. Conviction and removal from office, as charged by the House Managers, is simply not warranted. The record does not sustain the level of proof necessary to convict and remove the President. Certain facts are indisputable: the President lied to the American people and to his wife and daughter about an extramarital affair; he lied to his staff; and he was misleading in his deposition in the Jones v. Clinton civil suit and his grand jury testimony.However, impeachment is not a Constitutional means to punish a President ``when he gets out of bounds,'' as proposed by the House Managers. The constitutional standard is whether high crimes and misdemeanors were committed, and that test has not been met.In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee rejected an article of impeachment against President Nixon based on the filing of a false tax return. I was reasoned that the President's misleading tax return was unrelated to his duties as president, although a minority believed the count was unsupported by the evidence. Thus we see that all crimes that may be punishable by the courts are not punishable by impeachment.Rather, impeachment is narrowly limited by the Constitution to offenses of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. After listening to many presentations on this issue, I am convinced that impeachment and removal from office should only be used for crimes against the country or threats to our national security.Our founding fathers carefully defined the terms of impeachment in a manner that establishes a high threshold and requires the charges to be of an egregious nature. That is why the Senate has only once before held an impeachment trial for a President.The House Managers recommend impeachment because it is the only way in which the President's misconduct can be punished. Yet, I remind my colleagues that the President remains subject to criminal and civil penalties after he leaves office in two years.As I will point out, the facts and other evidence accumulated and presented to the Senate do not meet the constitutional standard for impeachment and removal that our founding fathers established.Article One charges the President with perjury before the grand jury in August 1998, for willfully giving false testimony under oath in a judicial proceeding. Yet to prove this charge the House Managers introduced material from the Jones suit during their Senate presentation even though the House rejected an article of impeachment dealing with Paula Jones suit. Nonetheless, despite this blurring of the lines between criminal and civil matters, a perjury conviction requires that the testimony be material to the case at hand. Judge Susan Webber Wright's rulings in the Jones case specifically excluded evidence concerning Monica Lewinsky because it was immaterial.Furthermore, Thomas Sullivan, former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, testified before the House Judiciary Committee that perjury ``can be particularly arcane, including the requirements that the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew his testimony to be false at the time he or she testified, that the alleged false testimony was material, and that any ambiguity or uncertainty about what the question or answer meant must be construed in favor of the defendant.'' Mr. Sullivan also noted that generally, ``federal prosecutors do not use the criminal process in connection with civil litigation involving private parties,'' because, ``there are well established remedies available to civil litigants who believe perjury or obstruction has occurred.''Article Two charges the President with seven different instances of obstruction of justice. The House Managers insist that the evidence shows that these separate acts constitute a deliberate attempt by the President to obstruct justice. The White House argues that the President did not seek to influence witnesses nor impede discovery. Legal scholars have argued that the lumping together of these seven charges would cause most courts to throw out the charges, and witness testimony undermines the House charges. After the smoke cleared from the charges and countercharges, it was evident to me that the connections between the actions of the President and the actions by the witnesses were circumstantial, at best.Moreover, I agree with White House counsel Charles F. Ruff, who in his closing arguments said of the House Managers, ``I believe their vision to be too dark, a vision too little attuned to the needs of the people, too little sensitive to the needs of our democracy.''In the obstruction of justice count, the Managers charge the President with asking Monica Lewinsky to lie, a charge that she denies in two dozen depositions, and testimony given under the protection of immunity. There is no evidence that the President ever asked her to provide a false affidavit in the Jones case or to testify falsely. Vernon Jordan, the President's close friend and advisor, testified that although he met with Ms. Lewinsky and was given a draft of the affidavit, he refused to review the document and referred the young woman to her attorney for advice and counsel.The House Managers say the President is guilty of obstructing justice when he ordered his secretary, Betty Currie, to retrieve gifts given by the President to Monica Lewinsky. However, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, on a number of occasions, indicates that it was she who asked Mrs. Currie to keep the gifts, not the President.The House states that the President asked Vernon Jordan to intensify an on-going job search in Ms. Lewinsky's behalf after Judge Webber Wright ruled that Paula Jones's attorney could investigate the President's sexual relations with state or federal employees.Lewinsky first met in November 1997, a month before Ms. Lewinsky was listed as a witness in the Jones case. Sinister motives do not appear to be involved in the inquiries by Mr. Jordan on her behalf that led to two job rejections and one job offer. Efforts by the House Managers to link the job search and the affidavit unravel when the dates on which Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky first met, when Ms. Lewinsky's name first appeared on the Paula Jones case witness list, and the drafting of the affidavit are analyzed.The President, Ms. Lewinsky, and Mr. Jordan have testified that no one was seeking Ms. Lewinsky's silence, and Ms. Lewinsky further testified that she realized in October 1997 that she would not be returning to the White House for employment and she renewed her job search in New York City.The additional testimonies of Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Jordan, and Mr. Blumenthal added no new information to the case against the President. I voted against deposing these witnesses since they already had been deposed many times.Moreover, we each received thousands of pages of testimony from the grand jury, various depositions, statements given under oath, and documents relating to the impeachment charges. We know that Ms. Lewinsky had been questioned on at least 23 separate occasions, including after the President's grand jury testimony and as recently as January 22, 1999, by the House prosecutors before testifying February 1, 1999, on video. During arguments in favor of deposing Ms. Lewinsky, House Manager Bryant urged the deposition because he believed the Senate should observe her demeanor, her tone, and her tenor in responding to questions.I respectfully disagreed with Mr. Bryant then, as I do now. My decision was bolstered when I viewed Ms. Lewinsky's videotaped testimony in which she reaffirmed her grand jury testimony. I saw no purpose in bringing her to the witness table again, nor Mr. Jordan, who had been questioned five times, nor Mr. Blumenthal, who has answered questions under oath four times. These witnesses did not change their testimonies, nor did they provide information that was omitted in previous testimony.The witnesses' statements are a matter of record, and they comprise thousands of pages encompassed in the volumes of testimony and sworn affidavits that are the basis of the House articles of impeachment. I concur with House majority counsel David Schippers who said during the House Judiciary impeachment proceedings, ``As it stands, all of the factual witnesses are uncontradicted and amply corroborated.''In conclusion, I cannot overstate my disappointment with the actions of the President. He deliberately misled the American people and greatly diminished the public's trust in the office of the presidency. However, I have concluded that the two articles of impeachment, as drafted and presented by the House, fail to meet the level of high crimes and misdemeanors, and I will vote to acquit the President.",

    "title": "STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS",
    "text": "Mr. President, today marks the 116th birthday of Dr. George Papanicolaou, who developed one of the most effective cancer screening tests in medical history--the Pap smear. Cervical cancer was one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in women in the United States 50 years ago and it is still a major killer of women worldwide. I rise today to introduce the Investment in Women's Health Care Act, a bipartisan bill to increase the reimbursement for Pap smear laboratory tests under the Medicare program. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues--Senators Snowe, Murray and Collins.The inadequacy of current lab test reimbursement was brought to my attention by pathologists who alerted me to the significant cost-payment differential for Pap smear testing in Hawaii. According to the American Pathology Foundation, Hawaii is one of the 23 States where the cost of performing the test greatly exceeds the Medicare payment. In Hawaii, the cost ranges between $13.04 and $15.80. Yet the Medicare reimbursement rate is only $7.15.The large disparity between the reimbursement level and the actual cost of performing the test may force labs in Hawaii and around the Nation to discontinue Pap smear testing. The below-cost reimbursement may compel some labs to process tests faster and in higher volume to improve cost efficiency. This situation increases the risk of inaccurate results and can severely handicap patient outcomes.This bill would increase the a reimbursement rate for Pap smear labwork from its current $7.15 to $14.60--the national average cost of the test. This rate is important because it establishes a benchmark for many private insurers.Last year, we were successful in having language included in the omnibus appropriations conference report recognizing the large disparity between the costs incurred to provide the screening tests and the amount paid by Medicare. The conferees noted that data from laboratories nationwide indicates that the cost of providing the test averages $13.00 to $17.00, with the costs in some areas being higher. Accordingly, conferees urged the Health Care Financing Administration to increase Medicare reimbursement for Pap smear screening. Although HCFA has indicated a willingness to increase this payment, I am concerned that the adjustment the agency is considering may be significantly less than the costs incurred by most laboratories in providing this service. Therefore, my colleagues and I are compelled to reintroduce legislation that would implement what we believe to be an appropriate increase.Mr. President, no other cancer screening procedure is as effective for early detection of cancer as the Pap smear. Over the last 50 years, the incidence of cervical cancer deaths has declined by 70 percent due in large part to the use of this cancer detection measure. Evidence shows that the likelihood of survival when cervical cancer is detected in its earliest stage is almost 100 percent, if treatment and follow-up is timely. If the Pap smear is to continue as an effective cancer screening tool, it must remain widely available and reasonably priced for all women. Adequate payment is necessary to ensure women's continued access to quality Pap smears.I urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan legislation. Mr. President, I also ask consent the text of my bill be included in the Record.",

    "title": "THE CHALLENGE OF BIOTERRORISM",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to address the threat of bioterrorism to our Nation's security.President Bush has asked Vice President Cheney to ``oversee the development of a coordinated national effort so that we may do the very best possible job of protecting our people from catastrophic harm.'' He also asked Joseph Allbaugh, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to create an Office of National Preparedness to implement a national effort.On May 9, 2001, Attorney General Ashcroft testified before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that the Department of Justice is the lead agency and in sole command of an incident while in the crisis management phase, even if consequence management activities, such as casualty care and evacuation, are occurring at the same time. Clearly, FEMA and the Department of Justice need to work together to shoulder the burden of responding to a large scale event. What is unclear, however, is how the Department of Justice will know that its crisis management skills are needed during a bioterrorism event.When will a growing cluster of disease be recognized as a terrorist attack? How do we differentiate between a few individuals with the flu and a flu-like epidemic perpetrated by terrorists? When will it be called a crisis? When will the FBI or Justice be called in to handle the newly declared ``crisis?'' In the case of a bioterrorist attack, the response will most likely be the same as if it was a naturally occurring epidemic. The key question is not ``how to respond to an attack'' but ``are we prepared to respond to any unusual biological event?''What would happen if a bioterrorist attack occurred today? It would not be preceded by a large explosion. Rather, over the course of a few days or a couple of weeks, people would start to get sick. They would go to hospitals, doctor's offices, and clinics. Hopefully, a physician in one hospital would notice similarities between two or three cases and contact the local public health officials. Maybe another physician would do the same and maybe, finally, the Center for Disease Control would be notified. So, the first responders would not be a Federal agency.Across the country, local law enforcement, fire, HAZ MAT and emergency medical personnel are doing a tremendous job preparing and training for terrorist attacks, and I commend their efforts. But, in the scenario I described, they would not be our first line of defense. Instead, the first responders for a biological event would be the physicians and nurses in our local hospitals and emergency rooms. We need to ensure that hospitals and medical professionals are prepared to deal with this threat. This is not the case today.This past November, emergency medical specialists, health care providers, hospital administrators, and bioweapon experts met at the Second National Symposium on Medical and Public Health Response to BioTerrorism. A representative of the American Hospital Association, Dr. James Bentley, spoke about the challenges hospitals are confronting and stated that ``we have driven over the past twenty years to reduce flexibility and safeguards.'' Flexibility and safeguards are exactly what is needed by a hospital to go from ``normal'' to ``surge'' operations. Surge operations do not require the extreme scenario of thousands of casualties from a bioweapon. Dr. Thom Mayer, chief of the emergency department at Inova Fairfax Hospital, was quoted in the Washington Post, on April 22, 2001, stating that 20 or 30 extra patients can throw an emergency department into full crisis mode.Dr. J.B. Orenstein, an emergency room physician, in a recent Washington Post op-ed, wrote about the ``State of Emergency'' the dedicated men and women working in our hospitals and clinics are already facing without the added worry of bioterrorism. Until a year ago, hospitals dealt with surges for only a few days or a week a year during the winter flu, cold and icy sidewalk season. Now, mini-surges occur in the spring, summer and fall due to decreasing numbers of emergency rooms, beds available in any hospital, and qualified nurses. On May 9, 2001, the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine convened a special meeting in Atlanta to discuss ``The Unraveling Safety Net.'' Are we, with all the planning and funding the Federal Government has done over the past few years to address terrorism, providing sufficient help for hospitals to prepare for bioevents?As Chairman of the Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services, I am concerned that we are not addressing a fundamental problem. Would a biological event be a national security/law enforcement incident with public health concerns, or would it be a public health crisis with a law enforcement component? I hope that the effort led by Vice President Cheney will address specifically this question and that the unique problems biological weapons present are not overlooked by any national plan to counter terrorism. I ask unanimous consent that the text of Dr. Orenstein's article be printed in the Record.",

    "text": "Mr. President, as the government moves to protect its citizens, harden its borders, and defends American interests abroad, I want to make sure that the Nation's Federal employees are given the resources and support needed to carry out these missions.Numerous studies point to the government's inability to compete with the private sector as one reason why we are unable to attract and retain qualified Federal employees. With a few exceptions, since 1981, military and Federal personnel have received equal pay increases. Yet, the administration's FY03 budget calls for an across-the-board adjustment of only 2.6 percent, while the military would receive a 4.1 percent increase. The proposed 2.6 percent increase is less than the formula used by the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act and fails to close the pay gap between Federal and private sector workers.In my capacity as Chairman of both the Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services and the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, I am actively involved in issues relating to Federal employees. Our civilian workforce plays a significant role in the support of our service members on active duty, in the reserves, and serving with the National Guard. I support a cohesive and coordinated effort in safeguarding America and believe a strong civilian workforce is crucial to our success in protecting our country.By 2005, over half the Federal workforce will be eligible to retire, and as long as fewer young people are choosing Federal service to fill these gaps, there should be a commitment from the highest levels of government to ensure that agencies are adequately staffed with the right people and the right skills to run the government in an effective and efficient manner.The American people know that the war on terrorism will be a long struggle; a different kind of war with fronts both at home and abroad. Our civilian Federal workforce is on the front line of this war and must be prepared to respond to the possibility of attack. We should not distinguish between our civilian and military workforces, both of whom serve their country with equal dedication.",

    "title": "HONORING CONGRESSWOMAN PATSY T. MINK",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to offer a few words in tribute to a distinguished colleague and dear friend, Congresswoman Patsy Takemoto Mink, who passed away Saturday afternoon in Honolulu, HI. I am deeply saddened by the passing of my friend and colleague, Patsy Mink, and I join our Congressional delegation, and the people of Hawaii and the Nation in extending heartfelt sympathy to John and Wendy Mink, her husband and daughter, Eugene Takemoto, her brother, and all of Patsy's extended family and her loyal staff in Washington and Hawaii.I feel a tremendous sense of loss at the untimely death of Congresswoman Patsy Takemoto Mink. Her passing leaves a void in the House of Representatives, the Hawaii congressional delegation, and the political life of our Nation. It is difficult to put her spirit into words, but those that come immediately to mind as fitting characterizations of the woman we honor today include courageous, forthright, tenacious, gutsy, outspoken, bold, meticulous, and determined. She was my friend, a dedicated public servant for Hawaii, a strong pillar in our state's delegation, and an advocate for those in America who feel scared, small, alone, mistreated, neglected or forgotten.Patsy was a petite woman with a powerful voice and a peerless reputation as a champion for equal opportunity, civil rights, and education. She was a courageous and tenacious leader whose lifetime of public service made Hawaii a better place. Her leadership in health, education, child welfare, and social services will endure and continue to benefit Hawaii's people and all Americans.In the course of her life, Patsy was a pioneer, a trailblazer for women, workers, minorities, the poor, and the powerless. In the history of Hawaii and our Nation in the 20th century, Patsy Mink is one of the giants whose vision of hope and passion for justice led Hawaii to statehood and whose efforts broke down barriers and opened doors to opportunity for everyone, regardless of race, gender, or religion. Her passing silences a dynamic voice, but her many accomplishments, her unimpeachable integrity, and passion for justice stand as an incredible legacy to a magnificent woman.I commend to my colleagues and all those interested in Patsy's remarkable life, a biography by Esther Arinaga and Rene Ojiri included in a book titled Called from Within: Early Women Lawyers of Hawaii, edited by Mari Matsuda. I wish to recap some of her brilliant life and career for the Record.Born on December 6, 1927, in Paia, Maui, Patsy was independent and ambitious from the start. As an illustration, one family story recalls that she insisted at age four on beginning school a year early. She was driven throughout her young life, and was elected student body president at Maui High School. She graduated as valedictorian in 1944, a year marked by global strife and war.Patsy's childhood curiosity about medicine led her to study zoology and chemistry at the University of Hawaii. After graduating in 1948, she applied to medical school, only to be rejected along with other bright young women aspiring to be doctors, in a time when women made up only 2 to 3 percent of an entering class. Another factor daunting her efforts was the return of our war veterans and a resulting boom in applications for graduate and postgraduate programs. Although discouraged, Patsy took wise counsel from a mentor and applied to law schools. She gained admission to the University of Chicago. It was during her years of law studies that she would meet and marry John Mink, a respected hydrologist and geologist, her loyal campaign advisor, and her lifelong companion. It was in Chicago that they would have their daughter, Wendy, a professor at Smith College.Returning to Hawaii, Patsy gained admission to the Hawaii bar in 1953, but only after a successful challenge of a statute that required a woman to take the residency status of her husband, who was a native Pennsylvanian. Such an action represented only one of several challenges to sexism that she would undertake during her professional career. In being admitted to the bar, she also logged one of many firsts by becoming the first Japanese American woman to do so in Hawaii.In the 1950s, Patsy began to take a serious interest in politics and make her mark on the Democratic Party by helping to build the party and draw many young people into its ranks. Patsy's first step into public elected office in the territorial legislature in 1956 awoke for Hawaii and the world a powerful voice that would only gain strength in its impact and not be silenced until the new millennium. From that moment forward, Patsy's professional and political record would run as if by perpetual motion.The momentous year of 1959 brought Statehood for Hawaii, and by then, Patsy had easily won election to the territorial Senate. Leading up to Statehood, while the legislature worked on landmark issues that would lend shape to Hawaii's new society, Patsy authored an ``equal pay for equal work'' law and scrutinized the Department of Education toward improving education for Hawaii's children--a cause close to my heart, as one who previously served as a teacher and principal in Hawaii's schools.In 1965, Patsy brought her views to the national stage when she became the first woman of color elected to the United States House of Representatives to represent Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District--a seat I was proud to hold for almost 14 years, before I entered the Senate. Patsy was articulate about the causes she tenaciously shepherded. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's fireside chats, heard years ago on Maui by a young Patsy, had provided her with a foundation of ideals and rhetoric from which she would draw upon for many years in her political career.During her first tenure in Congress, Patsy served her various constituencies, both in Hawaii and around this Nation, with a strong commitment to wide-ranging domestic issues, including education, the environment, child care, open Government, workers' rights, and equal opportunity. She introduced the first Early Childhood Education Act, authored the Women's Education Equity Act, supported strip mining regulation, and became an early critic of the Vietnam War. In 1971, she entered the Oregon Democratic Presidential primary. Her candidacy reflected her determined independence and frustration with Government cutbacks in social services spending and the ongoing war.In 1971, in connection with planned underground nuclear tests at Amchitka Island in the Aleutian chain, she filed suit with 32 other Members of Congress to compel disclosure of reports under the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA. She took issue with alleged Presidential authority to exempt certain information from FOIA and withhold it from judicial or legislative review. In the final outcome, in what had been described by Patsy as a sort of Waterloo of the Freedom of Information Act, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that Congress could legislate new disclosure guidelines to permit judicial review of the President's actions. In the end, the case gained tremendous historical significance when the U.S. Supreme Court cited it as precedent for the release of the Watergate tapes.In perhaps her farthest-reaching accomplishment, Patsy co-authored title IX of the Higher Education Act Amendments, which prohibits gender discrimination by educational institutions receiving Federal funds. The landmark provision was enacted in 1972 and has since, in its 30 years of existence, introduced equality in college sports and contributed greatly to the rise in women's athletics.An unsuccessful Senate bid ended her first set of years in Federal office in 1977, but it did not quiet her political involvement or public service. Indeed, in 1990 she returned to the House. In the interim, she assumed the position of Assistant Secretary of State for Ocean and International, Environmental, and Scientific Affairs, where she helped to strengthen environmental policies, particularly with regard to protection of whales, toxic chemical disposal and ocean mining. In 1980, she took the helm as the first woman president of the Americans for Democratic Action. Two years later, she returned to elected office in Hawaii by taking the gavel as chairperson of the Honolulu City Council. She twice ran unsuccessfully for other office, this time for Governor and mayor of Honolulu, then triumphed in 1990 in a special election for the remainder of my term in the other body, at the passing of our beloved colleague, Spark Matsunaga.Since 1990, she continued in characteristic style, advocating and articulating the ideals that she had espoused during her first terms in the other body. I remember Patsy marching up the Capitol steps with vigor, alongside her other female colleagues, to show her support for Anita Hill in 1991. I was pleased to work with Patsy, the distinguished senior Senator from Hawaii, Senator Dan Inouye, the honorable Secretary of Transportation, Norm Mineta, and my other colleagues in the establishment of a Congressional caucus to address the needs of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in 1994.I recall her leadership in 1996 on a successful boycott of a joint session speech by French President Jacques Chirac, in protest of French nuclear testing in the Pacific, much in line with our shared commitment to championing the disenfranchised peoples of the Pacific in our respective bodies. As we hope to complete action on a welfare reauthorization bill in this session, I remember Patsy's steadfast efforts before the passage of the 1996 welfare reform law in keeping us mindful about the possible effects of social policy changes on children. She had continued the battle cry with the current welfare reauthorization and ensured that the voices of the smallest and most vulnerable were heard.Patsy was one of the last Members of the 107th Congress who served in the historic 89th Congress that passed much of the landmark Great Society legislation. Patsy's lifelong efforts to open educational access to countless Americans and ensure them the best educational opportunities were the achievements that brought her the greatest satisfaction. ``Anything for the children,'' was Patsy's guiding conviction. I believe we shared the same view about education that this crucial area is where we can do the most good for the most people.A great spirit has come and gone before us. Patsy's vigor and courage to tackle difficult issues in the wide realm of social policy will be sorely missed. There are fewer trails for women and minorities to blaze, thanks to Patsy's determination and spirit. Indeed, her trailblazing efforts will not end with her death, for the things she put into place will continue to benefit the lives of countless individuals, in our lifetime and for generations to come, in ways that may not ever be truly appreciated.We are enjoined to carry forth the mission that my dear colleague pursued during her remarkable career. With great sadness, we bid a final farewell and aloha pumehana to a fearless and remarkable lady, the most honorable Patsy Takemoto Mink.I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today to voice my disagreement with the priorities set forth in the budget resolution we have been debating, and support for the amendments offered by my colleagues from South Carolina and New York, Senators Hollings and Schumer. With our Nation at war, we must do all we can to support our troops, ensure that our homeland is secure, and continue our emphasis on significant domestic priorities, such as education and health care. This is why I believe it would be unwise to enact further tax cuts that would pit these priorities against each other for limited Federal dollars and lead us further down the path to fiscal irresponsibility.We have commenced military operations against an enemy who has defied efforts at international diplomacy. Without a doubt, these efforts will come at substantial cost which is not reflected in this budget. Proponents must rely on budget tactics to show that we can allow additional tax cuts to be passed. I would like to associate my comments with those of my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, who rightfully attempted to enforce patriotic pause on this very point.This budget repudiates our commitment to fight the evil of terrorism within our own borders. It fails to adequately fund homeland security, which is why I am a cosponsor of the amendment offered by my friend from New York, Senator Schumer, who has requested that $88 billion be provided over 11 years for urgent homeland security needs, including immediate funding for those on the home front--first responders, firefighters, port, border and transportation security. I also applaud the provisions for bioterrorism preparedness and threat and critical infrastructure assessment. At a time when threats to U.S. civilians within our borders are very real, we must not abandon, for the sake of tax cuts, our resolve to ensure the peace of mind of families at home and individuals in their workplaces--many who are praying for loved ones fighting in our armed services abroad.This resolution calls for tax cuts that will do nothing to stimulate the economy, but would worsen the progressivity of the Tax Code. It would also rob our most important investment of required resources, and that is the investment in the education of America's children. We should be sending the message to our children that we will do all we can to give them the knowledge and tools to be able to meet future challenges that will face this country, when we in this body are long gone. Instead, if we pass additional tax cuts, we are saying that we will place political gain over a solid start in life for young Americans. This is why I voted for the amendment proposed by my colleague from Washington State, Senator Murray, along with others, that would have provided an $8.9 billion increase in education funding, as well as $8.9 billion for deficit reduction out of funding designated for tax cuts. This funding increase sought to fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act. We only began to fulfill some of the promises we made in passing this sweeping education reform law through the fiscal year 2003 appropriations process. We cannot let this investment waver in fiscal year 2004.Finally, I oppose efforts to decrease Federal revenues sorely needed to ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries have access to the comprehensive prescription drug program that they deserve. Far too many seniors are currently unable to afford the costs of the prescription drugs that their doctors prescribe. Seniors must be able to obtain meaningful prescription drug coverage through the traditional Medicare Program. I supported the amendment sponsored by my colleagues, Senators Bob Graham, Dorgan, and Stabenow, which would have made sure that a Medicare prescription drug benefit is adequately funded, by increasing the Medicare reserve fund by approximately $220 billion. The amendment would also have guaranteed that participants in traditional Medicare receive the same prescription drug benefit as beneficiaries that enroll in private Medicare health plans. The funding should be included in the budget resolution to adequately protect our Nation's seniors against the increasing costs of prescription drugs instead of to accommodate additional tax cuts. The Graham-Dorgan-Stabenow amendment would have reduced the size of the tax cuts in the budget resolution by approximately $400 billion and provided a clear choice between additional tax cuts or a meaningful prescription drug benefit.The time has come to face our fiscal responsibilities honestly. Tax cuts are not the answer at this point in our Nation's history. I join with Senator Hollings and other colleagues in opposition to the passage of additional tax cuts that would steal much needed revenues at a time of great need. I owe it to the people of Hawaii and we owe it to the people of America.",

    "title": "NOMINATION OF JUDGE SAMUEL ALITO TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the confirmation of Judge Samuel Alito as an Associate Justice of the United States. In the months since President George W. Bush nominated Judge Samuel Alito as an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, I have carefully considered his record. I evaluated his long history of government service and his work on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and I have closely followed his confirmation hearings.When I review all the evidence before me, I do not believe Judge Alito will be able to fairly apply the principles embodied in the U.S. Constitution. Our Constitution sets forth important civil rights and privacy protections that are fundamental to our way of life today. In recent years, these freedoms have been precariously protected by a delicate balance on the Supreme Court, with Justice O'Connor frequently tipping the scales in favor of the civil rights and privacy protections that so many Americans depend upon. I am disheartened by the reality that so many of these freedoms will likely be eroded when Judge Alito joins the Court.Judge Alito's approach to the law is not merely conservative, it is extreme. Judge Alito's opinions in race and gender employment discrimination cases have crafted a restrictive interpretation of civil rights laws that would make it much more difficult for women and minorities to prevail or even receive a jury trial. I am also troubled by Judge Alito's statement in his infamous 1985 job application that he was ``particularly proud'' of his work in the Reagan administration, where he counseled the administration to restrict affirmative action and limit remedies for racial discrimination. I cherish our system of checks and balances in Government, where each branch of the Government is coequal with the other. I believe that it is critical that this balance, which our forefathers so wisely and carefully created, is protected and maintained. However, Judge Alito supports the ``unitary executive'' theory, an expansive view of Presidential powers that he and his colleagues set forth while working in the Office of Legal Counsel of the Reagan Justice Department. Since joining the Third Circuit, Judge Alito made it clear that he still holds the premise of the ``unitary executive'' theory to be true, and this approach concerns me, especially in this political climate. This approach also undermines Congress's authority to protect the public. Judge Alito has ruled that Congress did not have the authority to pass the Family Medical Leave Act or to enact a Federal ban on the possession or transfer of machine guns. In both cases, the Supreme Court disagreed with Judge Alito's conclusions and upheld these protections, demonstrating that Judge Alito's opinions are not in the mainstream.I take my responsibility to provide advice and consent seriously. I cannot support Judge Alito's nomination. Unfortunately, Judge Alito is expected to be confirmed as Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's replacement. This means he will be in the position to affect a number of critical issues in the coming years. Important questions on privacy, the environment, Presidential power, and women's reproductive rights will all come before the Court to be resolved. With Judge Alito sitting on the Supreme Court, I am very concerned about the direction the Court will take our great Nation. Although during his hearings Judge Alito promised that he would not legislate from the bench, his record indicates otherwise. For the sake of our country, I am hopeful that Judge Alito will take seriously his commitments to uphold the principles of our Constitution.",

    "text": "I join my colleagues in tribute to my dear friend and tremendous public servant, Congressman, Senator, and Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, on his recent passing. His tenure in Federal service is notable and well documented three terms in the House of Representatives and four terms in the Senate representing the people of Texas and 2 years as Secretary of the Treasury under former President Bill Clinton.I remember Lloyd as a giant in the Senate leadership when I first came to this body in 1990. He wielded the gavel at the Finance Committee and had already ascended to national recognition as a formidable Vice Presidential nominee in 1988. He was a Senator who worked hard every day to benefit the people of Texas and of this country.As a distinguished World War II veteran, Lloyd was always supportive of our veterans and fulfilling their urgent needs. He fought to preserve and protect women's rights, including the Equal Rights Amendment. He understood the needs of America's entrepreneurs and business owners and carried his acumen in economic policy from the Senate into the Clinton administration.Millie and I remember Lloyd and his wife B.A., from our years in the Senate together, with fondness. We join others in extending to his family our warmest wishes in this difficult time. We say farewell to a true statesman. This Nation is richer for his life and poorer for his loss.",

    "title": "REMEMBERING U.S. SENATOR HIRAM FONG",
    "text": "Mr. President, on August 18, 2006, I will have the honor and privilege to commemorate the 47th anniversary of the admission of Hawaii to the United States by dedicating the building housing the Kapalama Post Office in honor of the late U.S. Senator Hiram L. Fong. It is fitting that on Admissions Day, the State of Hawaii commemorates the life of one of its strongest advocates for statehood--Senator Fong--by dedicating the postal facility at 1271 North King Street in Honolulu, which stands near Senator Fong's boyhood home in Kalihi.Like so many of us with immigrant parents, Senator Fong will be remembered not only for his many accomplishments but also for his humble beginnings. As one of 11 children born to parents from China, he graduated with honors from the University of Hawaii in 1930, and continued his education at Harvard University where he received a law degree 5 years later. In 1959, when Hawaii achieved statehood, he was elected to fill one of two seats in the U.S. Senate where he served from 1959 until January 2, 1977.Senator Fong was this Nation's first U.S. Senator of Asian ancestry. He served as the ranking Republican on what was then the Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee, which is why I am so glad we are marking his life's work by dedicating this post office in his memory. I knew Hiram Fong, and I found him to be a man of great integrity. He was a compassionate advocate for civil rights and workers' rights, and throughout his 20 years of service in Congress, Senator Fong personified the spirit of bipartisan cooperation. He was instrumental in enacting landmark civil rights legislation; reforming U.S. immigration laws to end discrimination against Asian immigrants; improving job training programs for workers; and fighting for equal pay for women. The people of Hawaii were truly fortunate to have been represented by Hiram Fong.This son of Hawaii passed away on August 18, 2004, at the age of 97, followed by his wife Ellyn on March 25 of this year. Hiram and Ellyn are survived by 4 children, Hiram, Jr., Rodney, Marvin, and Mari-Ellen; 10 grandchildren; and 2 great-grandchildren. As we remember our good friend, Hiram Fong, on this Admissions Day, I ask my Senate colleagues and the people of Hawaii to pause for a moment to remember all he did on behalf of the Nation and his beloved Aloha State.Mr. President, as the former chairman of the Senate Postal Subcommittee, I was proud to introduce the legislation designating the Kapalama Post Office in memory of my friend, Senator Hiram Fong. The Senate passed my bill, S. 2089, by unanimous consent on March 3 of this year; the House of Representatives took action on March 7; and on March 20, the President signed the bill, which is now Public Law 109-203.",

    "title": "MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007",
    "text": "Mr. President, I thank my colleague very much for the opportunity to speak at this time. I rise today in support of Senator Kent Conrad's amendment. I thank Senator Conrad for his leadership and agreeing to include a provision on behalf of the senior Senator from Hawaii, Dan Inouye, and myself to H.R. 5385, the Fiscal Year 2007 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.Mr. President, I was in Hawaii on October 15, 2006, when we felt a violent tremor, an earthquake measuring 6.7 in magnitude that rocked the Hawaiian Islands, and it set off a series of aftershocks for days afterward.The earthquake loosened rocks, dirt, and building foundations, and subsequent heavy rains have continued to undermine the structural integrity of public utilities, buildings, roads, and related infrastructure. In recognition of these damages, President Bush on October 17, 2006, declared the State as a major disaster area. While this declaration enabled some relief from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, a significant amount of damage remains unaddressed.The farming community was hit particularly hard by the earthquake. The water intakes for the Lower and Upper Hamakua Ditches and the Kohala Ditch on the Big Island were buried by landslides. The earthquake and the many aftershocks also caused the collapse of earthen tunnels and wooden flumes and cracks in dams. These irrigation systems provide the sole source of water for most farmers and other members of rural communities in the region. The Big Island also suffered a collapsed lane on the Hawaii Belt Road on the Hamakua Coast, north of Hilo town.The provision would add $21 million to address the agriculture damages caused by the October 15th earthquake:$12 million to the Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS, Emergency Watershed Protection Program for the repair of the Lower Hamakua Ditch and the Waimea Irrigation System/ Upper Hamakua Ditch--which were heavily damaged by the earthquake, and are negatively impacting the farming community on the Big Island; $3 million to the Big Island Resource Conservation and Development Council to repair of the Kohala Ditch system that was also severely damaged by the earthquake; $6 million to the Farm Service Agency, FSA, for its Emergency Conservation Program to repair broken irrigation pipelines and damaged and collapsed water tanks. Of this amount, $2 million will go towards repairing the damages to stone fences on cattle ranches in the Kona and Kohala areas, and another $2 million is needed under the Emergency Loan Program to cover losses of agricultural income.Mr. President, last week I met with Big Island farmers and ranchers whose livelihoods have been dramatically impacted by the October earthquake. They need water for their farms or they risk losing cattle and crops. The damage done to Hawaii's irrigation systems is too severe to be repaired by the State alone. I promised that I would not abandon these hard-working individuals.I ask my colleagues to support Senator Conrad's amendment, which would also help Hawaii's farmers and ranchers recover from last month's earthquake.Senator Inouye and I urge our colleagues and ask them for their support. Thank you very much. I yield back the remainder of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment offered by the senior Senator from North Dakota, Kent Conrad, to H.R. 5384, the Fiscal Year 2007 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. I am proud to have joined Senator Conrad, as well as the senior Senator from Hawaii, Dan Inouye, to provide much needed relief to agricultural communities across our nation in need of assistance.This legislation is important to the agricultural industry in the State of Hawaii, in particular the County of Hawaii which was significantly impacted by the October 15, 2006, earthquake. I was in my home State during this earthquake measuring 6.7 in magnitude and present during aftershocks that were felt days after the initial tremor. A few hours after the earthquake occurred, I spoke with Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, Director David Paulison to ensure that FEMA was ready to support State and local response and recovery efforts in Hawaii. In addition, the day after the earthquake I toured the Big Island with Senator Inouye, the National Guard, and State Civil Defense to assess the resulting damage.While I am pleased that Federal, State, and local agencies have been able to work cooperatively to provide public and individual assistance, the needs of our agricultural community must not be ignored. Irrigation systems damaged by the earthquake are the sole source of water for a majority of farmers and members of rural communities in this region. In addition to the economic impact, it is imperative that we recognize that the livelihoods of these hard working individuals have drastically been impacted by the earthquake. It is for this reason I join my colleagues in supporting this amendment which would provide $3 million to the Farm Service Agency, FSA, for its Emergency Conservation Program to repair broken irrigation pipelines and damaged and collapsed water tanks. Of this amount, $2 million will go toward repairing the damages to stone fences on cattle ranches in the Kona and Kohala areas, and another $1 million is needed under the Emergency Loan Program to cover losses of agricultural income.

This amendment is necessary to ensure that they may continue to provide U.S. agricultural products, and I ask my colleagues to support this important amendment.",

    "title": "HONORING SENATORIAL SERVICE",
    "text": "Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation for all of the public service efforts of the senior Senator from Maryland, Paul Sarbanes. My friend has served in the Senate since 1977, which makes him the longest serving United States Senator from Maryland.It has been a pleasure working with Senator Sarbanes over the years on a number of issues. In 2001, I was fortunate to be added to the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. At that time, the Senator from Maryland was serving as the chairman of the committee and it was a memorable session to be a part of the committee. In the wake of the accounting failures of Enron and other public companies, Chairman Sarbanes conducted a very thorough series of hearings which led to the legislation which is now known as Sarbanes-Oxley. This is landmark legislation that has increased corporate responsibility and resulted in more effective oversight of public companies. Without the vision, courage, and ability of my friend from Maryland, that legislation would not have been possible. Despite numerous obstacles, he brought about comprehensive accounting reform.In addition, I have enjoyed working closely with the Senator from Maryland in trying to improve the financial literacy of our country. Rising health care costs and insurance premiums and the lack of affordable housing have contributed to making the lives of working families more difficult as they strain to meet their day-to-day needs. The ability of families to meet their increasing financial obligations is hampered by their significant debt burdens, particularly credit card debt, and by predatory lending practices such as refund anticipation loans. A lack of financial literacy makes it harder for families to deal with the difficult decisions they are confronted with daily. Senator Sarbanes organized the first set of hearings on the issue of financial literacy and led the creation of the Financial Literacy and Education Commission, the purpose of which is to promote financial literacy and education among all American consumers.Senator Sarbanes has been a champion for Federal employees. Throughout his Senate career, he has fought to ensure that Federal employees and members of the military receive equal pay increases. He understands that the Federal civilian workforce plays a significant role in the support of our Armed Services, and I am honored to join him annually in offering a resolution calling for pay parity between the military and Federal workers.He has been a leading advocate for consumer protection, increasing access to affordable housing, and improving public transportation in our country. I will miss having my good friend from Maryland in the Senate. He has served Maryland and the country very well. Millie and I wish him and his family the very best.",

    "title": "STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today along with my distinguished colleagues, Senator Wyden, Senator Bunning, Senator Inouye, and Senator Durbin, to introduce the Paleontological Resources Preservation Act in order to protect and preserve the Nation's important fossil record for the benefit of our citizens. Vertebrate fossils are rare and important natural resources that have become increasingly endangered due to an increase in the illegal collection of fossil specimens for commercial sale. However, at this time there is no unified policy regarding the treatment of fossils by Federal land management agencies which would help protect and conserve fossil specimens. Consequently, we risk the deterioration or loss of these valuable scientific resources. This Act will correct that omission by providing uniformity to the patchwork of statutes and regulations that currently exist. By creating a comprehensive national policy for preserving and managing paleontological resources found on Federal land, this Act will also be instrumental in curtailing and preventing future illegal trade thereby ensuring that many generations to come will have access to these invaluable records of our past. I would like to emphasize that this bill covers only paleontological remains on Federal lands and in no way affects archaeological or cultural resources under the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 or the Native American Graves Protection and Rehabilitation Act.I would also mention that this bill is exactly the same bill that I introduced in the 109th Congress. This bill was heard and marked up by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and was passed by the Senate.As a senior member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and Chair of the Subcommittee on National Parks, I am very concerned about the preservation of fossils as records of earth's past upheavals and struggles. While I recognize the value of amateur collecting--and casual collecting--of fossils is protected in this bill--fossil theft has become an increasing problem. New fossil fields and insights into the earth's past are discovered nearly every month. Paleontological resources can be sold on the market for a hefty price. For example, the complete skeleton of a T-Rex was sold for $8.6 million at auction to the Field Museum of Chicago. Consequently, they are being stolen from public lands without regard to science and education. The protections I offer in this Act are not new. Federal and management agencies have individual regulations prohibiting theft of government property. However, Congress has not provided a clear statute stating the value of paleontological resources to our Nation, as we have for archeological resources. We need to work together to make sure that we fulfill our responsibility as stewards of public lands, and as protectors of our Nation's natural resources.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,This Act may be cited as the ``Paleontological Resources Preservation Act''.As used in this Act: (1) Casual collecting.--The term ``casual collecting'' means the collecting of a reasonable amount of common invertebrate and plant paleontological resources for non- commercial personal use, either by surface collection or the use of non-powered hand tools resulting in only negligible disturbance to the Earth's surface and other resources. As used in this paragraph, the terms ``reasonable amount'', ``common invertebrate and plant paleontological resources'' and ``negligible disturbance'' shall be determined by the Secretary.

(4) Limitation.--The amount of any penalty assessed under this subsection for any one violation shall not exceed an amount equal to double the cost of response, restoration, and repair of resources and paleontological site damage plus double the scientific or fair market value of resources destroyed or not recovered. (b) Petition for Judicial Review; Collection of Unpaid Assessments.-- (1) Judicial review.--Any person against whom an order is issued assessing a penalty under subsection (a) may file a petition for judicial review of the order in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred within the 30-day period beginning on the date the order making the assessment was issued. Upon notice of such filing, the Secretary shall promptly file such a certified copy of the record on which the order was issued. The court shall hear the action on the record made before the Secretary and shall sustain the action if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. (2) Failure to pay.--If any person fails to pay a penalty under this section within 30 days-- (A) after the order making assessment has become final and the person has not filed a petition for judicial review of the order in accordance with paragraph (1); or (B) after a court in an action brought in paragraph (1) has entered a final judgment upholding the assessment of the penalty, the Secretary may request the Attorney General to institute a civil action in a district court of the United States for any district in which the person if found, resides, or transacts business, to collect the penalty (plus interest at currently prevailing rates from the date of the final order or the date of the final judgment, as the case may be). The district court shall have jurisdiction to hear and decide any such action. In such action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of such penalty shall not be subject to review.

    "text": "Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to join with my good friend, the senior Senator from Ohio, in reintroducing legislation today to establish a Deputy Secretary for Management who would be the chief management officer at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). I am especially pleased that we are joined by two of our colleagues on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Levin, who is also the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Senator McCaskill.The Department of Homeland Security continues to face serious challenges, some of which stem from integrating 22 separate entities with existing management problems into one agency. Such a broad, large-scale merger is why the Government Accountability Office (GAO) continues to place DHS on the GAO High-Risk List. Our bill would assign overall management responsibilities to one individual who would be accountable for leading and instituting change. A Deputy Secretary for Management would provide the leadership necessary to move forward and sustain these needed changes. This presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed individual, who will have a term of office of five years, would serve as a bridge between political appointees and career employees. Changing agency culture is difficult and takes time. As Comptroller General David Walker notes, successful transformation initiatives in large private and public sector organizations can take at least five to seven years.In addition to serving as chairman of Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee, I am also the chairman of the Armed Services Readiness and Management Support Subcommittee, and I have witnessed firsthand how the Department of Defense (DoD) continues to struggle with business modernization despite clear congressional directives to do so. We cannot afford to allow the Department of Homeland Security, which has an extremely complex and critical mission, to be affected by the same management problems facing DoD. Our bill is born out of our concern and frustration that DHS is not doing better. We believe elevating the Under Secretary for Management to the Deputy Secretary level will provide DHS the necessary tools needed to avoid making the same mistakes as DoD. Having a single focus for key management functions, such as human capital, financial management, information technology, acquisition management, and performance management are essential if DHS is to avoid the stovepipe style of management at DoD.A Deputy Secretary for Management would bring needed attention to management issues and transformational change; would integrate various key operational and transformation efforts; and would institutionalize accountability for addressing management issues and leading change. Our bill enhances, not diminishes, the ability of the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of DHS to focus on policy decisions while leaving the management efforts to the Deputy Secretary for Management. It is good business practice to have one individual responsible for integrating strategic plans and overseeing change.I would like to note that the Homeland Security Advisory Council, established to advise and make recommendations to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, created a Culture Task Force (CTF) at the request of Secretary Chertoff in June 2006. The CTF issued its recommendations to the Secretary last month. The January 2007 Report of the Homeland Security Culture Task Force recommends establishing an operational leadership position, ``who would report to the Secretary and be responsible for the high level Department-wide measures aimed at generating and sustaining operational integration and alignment of the component organizations.''Congress has a responsibility to ensure that agencies are instituting sound management practices that will empower agencies to spend taxpayer dollars more wisely while carrying out critical missions. A fully accountable chief management officer at DHS will make the difference by ensuring strong leadership over essential government programs.

    "title": "CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008",
    "text": "Mr. President, before I address the proposed funding for VA in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2008, I applaud Chairman Conrad and his colleagues on the Budget Committee for their hard work on this resolution. The measure before us today clearly reflects the right priorities and directions for our Nation.For a number of years, I have made the case for the President to include funds for VA health care as part of the war supplemental packages he has submitted to Congress, and every year, my colleagues and I fought to get those funds included in the budget resolution to no avail.The pending budget resolution finally recognizes that caring for returning service members and veterans is part of the cost of war and in turn proposes to fund VA health care appropriately for this effort.Right now, a great deal of attention is being paid to the needs of our men and women in uniform--attention that Chairman Conrad, myself, and other Members of this Chamber have been talking about for quite some time. I am proud to stand with Chairman Conrad in support of our service members and veterans.One of the harshest realities of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is the number of service members who have sustained complex and multiple injuries in combat.In stark contrast to past conflicts, significant improvements in battlefield medicine have enabled very seriously wounded service members to survive their injuries. Subsequently, these men and women are coming home with extraordinarily complex health care needs.We know that right now, there have been 1,882 identified and registered cases of service members who have suffered from traumatic brain injuries, or TBI, alone. This does not include those who have suffered from a milder form of this injury and may not even be aware of it. While TBI is becoming the signature wound of the current conflicts, many of these soldiers also have been rendered blind or lost a limb as a result of their injuries and the numbers of those who are coming back with serious and multiple wounds continues to grow.In recognition of the emerging medical and rehabilitative needs of veterans with traumatic brain and other injuries, Congress directed VA to establish specialized centers for rehabilitative care. VA's four lead Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers are essential to meeting the needs of the most severely injured veterans and their families.In the budget before us today, Chairman Conrad and his colleagues have provided over $300 million specifically for meeting the needs of these veterans and service members who are in need of the comprehensive health care and rehabilitative services VA delivers through their Polytrauma Centers.This level of funding will enable VA to conduct assessments and screenings of troops for traumatic brain injury, provide veterans with intensive comprehensive TBI/polytrauma rehabilitation, and most importantly, support intensive case management for veterans with TBI and other injuries when they return to their communities and continue the rehabilitation process.Recent reports by the VA inspector general and others have illustrated that case management is a key element in the process of assisting these veterans achieve the fullest possible recoveries. Funding VA so that it can provide the continuum of care needed by the most severely injured service members is imperative if we are to truly fulfill our obligation to take care of our troops and veterans.I am also very pleased that the budget resolution before us is making a long-overdue investment in mental health care.Studies published in some of the most prestigious journals have found that a third of those seeking VA care are coming for mental health concerns, including PTSD, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse. We do not know the full magnitude of this need, as many returning service members have yet to seek care from VA.As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, my goal is to make sure that VA is doing everything possible to guarantee that each and every veteran who needs mental health care--whether in North Dakota, Vermont, or Hawaii--can receive that care.I remind my colleagues that so much of the time, battle wounds manifest themselves as invisible wounds--wounds which cannot be seen but are every bit as devastating as physical wounds. PTSD affects not only a veteran's mental status, it affects his or her physical well-being as well. It impacts the veteran's relationships, his or her ability to work, and to interact in society. VA must catch readjustment issues early before they turn into full-blown PTSD, and this budget resolution would enable VA to take a serious approach towards making this happen.When we talk about the mental health needs of veterans, we cannot deny the reality that substance abuse is prevalent among many veterans. We know that many veterans with PTSD turn to drugs or alcohol in order to self-medicate. Yet the administration does not seem to want to be in the business of helping veterans with substance abuse problems. VA used to provide an intensive month-long program to treat substance abuse. Today, most VA substance abuse programs run for 2 weeks--not nearly enough time to put a veteran truly on the road to recovery. Again, this budget resolution provides funds for comprehensive inpatient substance abuse care. This is a very real investment in VA mental health care.On the benefits side, the current claims inventory and the time it takes to process a claim is unacceptable. Veterans deserve a timely and accurate response to their claims. It is obvious that Chairman Conrad agrees, as this budget resolution takes a major step toward responding to this very real problem by providing appropriate funding for VA to use to employ additional claims adjudicators.There are 30,000 more claims pending right now than last year this time. This constitutes an 8 percent increase. As the veterans population continues to age and new veterans come home from Iraq and Afghanistan, this trend of increased claims will continue. Given that it takes nearly 2 years for a new VA employee to start fully contributing to the bottom line, now is the time for new staff to be hired and trained to help reduce this caseload.Just 2 weeks ago, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs held a hearing on the VA claims adjudication process. During the hearing, VA witnesses testified to the nearly 400,000 ratings claims inventory and the 175 days it takes to process a claim for benefits. We must insist that VA have no more than 250,000 claims in the pipeline at once, and that it take not more than 125 days to adjudicate a claim. VA clearly needs additional resources to hire the employees needed to adjudicate claims in a timely manner, which this budget resolution certainly provides.Mr. President, I am very pleased with the investment in veterans programs that is made in this budget resolution. I again commend Chairman Conrad and the Budget Committee for sending the right message to our Nation's veterans--that we are honoring our commitment to them by making a real investment into their care. I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of the resolution before us today.",

I also take this opportunity to congratulate Chairman Conrad and the other conferees for their hard work on this resolution. This resolution reflects our commitment to fully fund veterans' health care and benefits.This budget resolution would provide $43.1 billion in fiscal year 2008 for the VA discretionary account--$3.6 billion more than the President requested. I am very pleased that the conference report follows the recommendations of the Democratic and Independent members of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs to provide $2.9 billion over the President's request for veterans' medical care alone. This includes an additional $303 million for treatment of traumatic brain injuries, and $693 million for VA mental health programs--two areas of vital importance to servicemembers returning from Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom.I also thank the Budget Committees for rejecting the President's proposals to impose an annual enrollment fee for VA health care and to increase the prescription drug copayment. These proposals would have unduly burdened thousands of veterans who cannot afford higher costs for the health care they have earned and deserve.I again commend Chairman Conrad and the other conferees for their work on the budget resolution, and for sending the right message to our Nation's veterans. We have made a commitment to their care, and this resolution honors that commitment. I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of the resolution before us today.",

    "title": "DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COLLEGE ACCESS ACT OF 1999",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 1124 and the opportunity it provides for DC's college-bound students. The reauthorization of the District of Columbia College Access Act of 1999 would continue a successful and effective scholarship program.The DC tuition assistance grant program, or DCTAG, provides scholarships to cover the difference between in-State and out-of-State tuition for eligible DC residents attending any public college or university in the country. DCTAG awards those recipients up to $10,000 annually and $50,000 total in tuition assistance.The original purpose of the bill was to address concern that college-bound students in the District were at a disadvantage because DC lacks a State university system. DCTAG expanded higher education opportunities by allowing students to attend public universities and colleges nationwide at in-State tuition rates.The original bill also allows students to attend a limited number of nonprofit private schools to receive scholarships of up to $2500 annually and $12,500 total. Students who attend any historically black college or university or any private school in the District, Maryland, or Virginia qualify for private school grants. The 2002 reauthorization clarified that the grants were only for U.S. citizens residing in DC.The success of the program is clear. Since the launch of DCTAG in 2000, participation among DC residents more than doubled from 1,900 recipients to 4,700 recipients. DCTAG has awarded 26,000 grants totaling over $141 million to 9,769 District students. I am pleased to say that a few of those grants went to students attending the University of Hawaii at Manoa in my home State.Not only are more students receiving grants; more are going to college. The college enrollment rate for DC public school students has doubled to 60 percent and 38 percent of students in the program are the first ones in their family to attend college. DCTAG affords many District residents a chance to go to college when they otherwise would not be able to afford it.In July, my Subcommittee on the District of Columbia held a hearing with the Mayor and his education leadership team on their reform proposal for the public school system. They offered a realistic picture of DC public schools and a realistic vision for accountability and reform.The Chancellor of Education, Michelle Rhee, and the Mayor are working very hard to improve the unacceptably low performance of DC students by recruiting talented teachers, reforming the administrative offices, and repairing crumbling schools. They deserve all the support that the Congress can provide in their efforts. As the cost of college tuition continues to rise at both public and private institutions, this scholarship program offers the District's students hope that if they perform well in high school they can have the same opportunity to access affordable, public, higher education as students in Virginia, in Maryland, and across the country.Students who know they have the opportunity to go to college are more likely to perform well in high school. The DCTAG program supports the Mayor's efforts to improve DC public schools by offering students the chance to go to college at a minimal cost to the Federal Government.The DCTAG bill was reported out of committee in February, and now is the time to finally get it passed. I understand my colleague and fellow committee member, Senator Coburn, has asked that two amendments to the legislation be considered.The first amendment would modify the eligibility standard for the scholarship recipients to exclude any student whose family earns an income of $1 million or more. Despite the high income threshold, I am concerned about starting down the road of making this a needs-based scholarship program. The program is designed to provide all DC residents access to a range of higher education institutions. I have agreed to accept this amendment despite my misgivings for the sake of the entire program's reauthorization.The second amendment, however, I am not prepared to accept. It would threaten the integrity and success of the program by increasing the grant amounts for private schools. Nearly 10 times the number of students in the program attend public schools versus private schools, and an increase in the grant amounts for private schools would reduce the overall available funding. Fewer students would be able to participate in the program, and lower income students trying to attend more affordable public schools, in particular, would be significantly burdened, in some cases, potentially, being forced to forego college altogether.For many students, the importance of this program in defraying out-of-State tuition costs means the difference between attending college or not. I cannot support this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment as well.DCTAG has helped thousands of DC students who receive postsecondary education. Its credibility and its effectiveness is evident.I urge my colleagues to support the bill and oppose Senator Coburn's second amendment.I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to commend Budget Committee chairman Kent Conrad for his fine work on this budget resolution. It will lower our taxes and create hundreds of thousands of new jobs for Americans. In addition, I am very pleased this budget resolution honors our Nation's veterans by providing the necessary funds for our wounded warriors. Funding for our veterans is very important, and I wish to speak about this again at a later time.The resolution passed by the Budget Committee last Thursday will balance our Federal budget by 2012 and fund programs that are critical to the health and safety of Americans. It provides tax relief to middle-income Americans, honors our fighting men and women in the Armed Forces, shows respect for our wounded and disabled veterans, and ensures the continued safety and security of our Nation.By focusing on the real needs of Americans and reviving our slowing economy, the budget resolution seeks to restore balance--balance to our finances and balance to our priorities for America. The budget resolution increases funding for veterans health care and children's health care. It provides a substantial increase above the President's budget for education and Head Start. It promotes greater efficiency and renewable energy programs. It extends middle-class tax cuts, such as marriage penalty relief and the child tax credit, and it brings more middle-class Americans into a 10-percent tax bracket. The budget resolution also invests in building and repairing roads, bridges, harbors, airports, and schools because we recognize our economic success depends on public infrastructure investment.As Chairman Conrad has noted, this budget is only a first step, but it is an important step to reach our goal of long-term fiscal security. I am prepared to join Chairman Conrad in this important mission to balance our budget, restore our military readiness, honor our commitment to troops and veterans, and enhance our national security.I urge my colleagues to do the same. It is time that we provide a real future for our children and our country.I yield the floor.",

    "text": "Madam President, I am pleased to discuss funding for VA in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2009. Chairman Conrad and his colleagues on the Budget Committee have done impressive work on this resolution.They have demonstrated sound judgment in their funding recommendation to address the needs of our country.Service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, like those who returned from Vietnam, Korea, World War II and all previous wars, bear the effects of their service.They show us that the costs of war do not end on the battlefield. In crafting this budget, we are in a position to ensure that care for returning service members, of every war, is a top priority.The Department of Veterans Affairs provides superior health care to millions of veterans every year.It is widely regarded as one of the top health care systems in America. Today, VA faces a growing wave of new demands--veterans of past wars are aging and making greater use of the system, and younger veterans of the current conflicts require a new range of services from Congress must provide the resources for VA to meet all of these demands.This budget resolution acknowledges the challenges facing VA. It meets our responsibility of caring for our Nation's service members and veterans. In recent years, VA and Congress have made a tremendous investment in mental health services. I am pleased that this budget reflects an ongoing commitment to better serve the needs of veterans with mental health concerns.Madam President, I remind my colleagues that battle wounds frequently manifest themselves as invisible wounds. These wounds can be just as devastating as physical wounds. Indeed, many mental health disorders, including substance use disorder and PTSD, have both physical and mental manifestations.They impact the veteran's relationships and his or her ability to work and to interact in society. The effects of many mental health disorders can be limited or even avoided if they are caught and treated promptly, before long-term disabilities develop.This budget resolution provides the funds to continue the essential task of providing timely access to mental health care for all veterans.Families play a critical role in the well-being of veterans. As chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I held a hearing yesterday on the role of families in veterans' lives, and on the support VA and DoD provides them.Families are often the primary caregivers for injured veterans, and provide essential assistance in recovery and rehabilitation through reintegration into civilian life. The degree of support provided by family members is directly related to a veteran's ability to deal effectively with readjustment and mental health concerns.Providing support to veterans' families is in VA's vital interest.One of the harshest realities of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is the number of soldiers who have sustained complex and multiple injuries in combat.Significant improvements in battlefield medicine have enabled many seriously wounded servicemembers to survive their injuries. These men and women are coming home with extraordinarily complex health care needs.VA and Congress have focused on addressing the needs of these veterans. There have been improvements in screening and care for service members with traumatic brain injury, but much remains to be done.In addition, Congress directed VA to establish specialized centers for rehabilitative care in response to the challenging medical and rehabilitative needs of veterans with multiple and complex injuries.VA's four lead polytrauma rehabilitation centers are essential to meeting the needs of the most severely injured veterans and their families.As we work to meet the needs of all returning servicemembers, we must pay close attention to the full range of war wounds--from eye trauma and damage to servicemembers' hearing, to PTSD and depression, to burn injuries.Another important tool which VA is still developing is comprehensive health screening for returning servicemembers. This is absolutely essential. Without effective screening for mental health disorders, traumatic brain injury, hearing and vision loss and other injuries or disorders, VA will miss opportunities to help veterans in need of services.Further, I believe comprehensive health screening before deployment is essential to help with the evaluation and understanding of the effects of combat on servicemembers. As chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have worked to ensure that all veterans receive appropriate health screenings. I will continue to advocate for these screenings.On the benefits side of the ledger, in the last year, Congress has provided a significant amount of funding to VA for much-needed staffing to adjudicate claims. Our Nation's veterans deserve nothing less than having their claims rated accurately and in a reasonable period of time. Now, the American people, especially veterans, will expect to see a decreasing backlog and increased timeliness and quality.I pledge my continuing support to get veterans the benefits they need in an appropriate amount of time. Congress must now assure that VA has sufficient funding for technology and training initiatives to aid in its endeavor to reduce the backlog of claims. This budget resolution is certainly a step in the right direction.The entitlement funding provided to veterans in this budget resolution reflects the Nation's continuing responsibility to care for he who has borne the battle, long after the last shots of war have been fired. Indeed, I view funding for veterans' entitlements as a continuing cost of war.The administration's VA budget request proposed severe cuts to many essential programs and accounts. Research, the inspector general, the National Cemetery Administration, and grants for State home construction would all be unnecessarily cut.I am particularly troubled by the proposed cuts of nearly 50 percent to the VA construction accounts. Over the past year, internal reviews identified widespread maintenance concerns, in addition to already planned construction projects. I find it unconscionable that in the face of the pressing demands across the country, the President would suggest such cuts. The budget proposal advanced by Chairman Conrad and his colleagues rectifies these mistakes in the President's request, and I appreciate their foresight on these issues.I am pleased with the investment in veterans programs that is made in this budget resolution. I again commend Chairman Conrad and the Budget Committee for their thoughtful and responsible work. Care for our Nation's veterans is truly a cost of war, and it is our responsibility to meet their needs.I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of the resolution before us.I thank you, Madam President.",

    "title": "LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT OF 2007--MOTION TO PROCEED--Resumed",
    "text": "Mr. President, yesterday was Equal Pay Day in America. It is befitting that it was on a Tuesday because Tuesday is the day on which women's wages catch up to men's wages from the previous week. It is most unfortunate that women continue to be discriminated against by employers, in particular those who routinely pay lower wages for jobs that are dominated by women.However, today my colleagues in the Senate will have an opportunity to begin the process to restore the intent of Congress as it relates to the fundamental fairness to millions of workers. We will have a chance to override a decision by the Supreme Court last June, in the case of Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. In this case, the Court, in a 5-to-4 ruling, reversed a longstanding interpretation, used by nine Federal circuits and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, EEOC, under which the statute of limitations for pay discrimination begins to run each time an employee receives a paycheck or other form of compensation. Instead, the Court ruled that the 180-day statute of limitations on filing a discrimination claim with the EEOC begins to run when the original discriminatory decision is made and conveyed to the employee, regardless of whether the pay discrimination continues beyond the 180-day period. This is an unfair and unjust ruling. For employees who are prohibited from having access to data reflecting the wages of other employees, it is impossible for them to ascertain whether they have been a victim of wage discrimination--let alone, to know from the original time of the discriminatory act. In many cases, employees may not know until years later that they have been discriminated against on the basis of pay.I urge my colleagues to support cloture on the motion to proceed to this important legislation, and to support enactment of this bill. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007 will restore the interpretation that the statute of limitations begins to run each time an employee receives a paycheck or other form of compensation reflecting the discrimination, otherwise known as the ``paycheck accrual'' rule. It would ensure that employees who can prove pay discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability will not be forever barred from seeking redress because they did not learn that they were victims of pay discrimination within 6 months after the discrimination first occurred.Although women still only earn 77 cents for every $1 earned by men, we should not be moving backwards. It is simple, this legislation will restore an employee's right to seek restitution against wage discrimination at the time the employee discovers it. In addition, it is important to note that this legislation is not just about gender pay discrimination. In 2007, EEOC received more than 7,000 pay discrimination charges. While some are on the basis of gender, others are on the basis of race, disability, national origin, and age.Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to do what is right and support cloture and passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.

Title I entails adjustments to education benefits currently offered by VA. Title II addresses disability claims adjudication, memorials affairs, insurance and specially adapted housing. Title III addresses health care matters, including nursing home care, contract-care payment, personnel pay and disclosure of private information and medical records. Title IV addresses VA police officers and VA medical facility leases.Title I of the bill would make several administrative and housekeeping changes to VA's education programs, allowing for faster and more efficient claims adjudication. Among other changes, this title would eliminate the requirement that a student file an application with VA upon changing his or her program of study while remaining enrolled at the same school and eliminate the requirement that wages must be earned in order to participate in VA's full-time on-job training, OJT, program.Title II would make changes to disability claims adjudication, memorial affairs, insurance and specially adapted housing. Specifically, it would explicitly authorize VA to stay temporarily its adjudication of a pending claim before a VA regional office or the Board of Veterans' Appeals, when a Federal Circuit appeal on the relevant issue is pending. It would also authorize the Board to decide cases out of docket-number order when a case has been stayed or when there is sufficient evidence to decide a claim, but a claim with an earlier docket number is not ready for decision. This title of the bill would also extend full-time and family SGLI coverage to Individual Ready Reservists.Title III pertains to health care matters, including nursing home care, contract-care payment, personnel pay and disclosure of private information and medical records. It would make permanent VA's authority to provide non-institutional extended care services either directly, by contract, or by another provider or payor. It would also extend VA's obligation to provide nursing home care to veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 70 percent or greater until December 31, 2013, and VA's authority to establish non-profit research corporations through the same date. This title would also repeal requirements that VA produce certain reports and make permanent VA's authority to assign enrollment priority category 6 to those veterans who participated in chemical and biological warfare testing at DOD's Deseret Test Center from 1962 to 1973.The fourth and final title of this bill would permit VA police officers to carry firearms and conduct investigations of crimes that occurred on VA property, while off VA property in an official capacity. It also would increase the uniform allowance of VA police officers, to ensure they do not have to pay out-of-pocket for uniform maintenance. Finally, it would raise the threshold for congressional authorization for major medical facility leases from $600,000 to $1,000,000.I am introducing this bill for the review and consideration of my colleagues at the request of the Administration. As Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have not taken a position on this legislation.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a letter of support be printed in the Record.",

    "title": "DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2009",
    "text": "Mr. President, as chairman of the District of Columbia subcommittee, I rise today in support of S. 160, the District of Columbia Voting Rights Act of 2009. I vote to enfranchise thousands of District residents and to affirm my commitment to the fundamental right of all Americans to participate in our great democracy.Despite our Nation's founding principle of ``no taxation without representation,'' District of Columbia residents lack full representation in Congress. They have sent sons and daughters to war in defense of our country, and they have paid Federal taxes in support of our Government. Despite this, the distinguished Delegate from the District of Columbia lacks a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives.Fair voting representation is fundamental to our democracy. I understand the challenges facing the District's residents, and I sympathize with its trouble to attain voting representation in Congress. I also understand that this will be an ongoing discussion. I am sensitive to the concerns raised by my colleagues on the constitutionality of our actions.Legal scholars have testified before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee that Congress does have the constitutional authority to extend a vote to a District Representative in the House. I believe this legislation is constitutional, but ultimately it is the role of the courts to decide.Our representative democracy is based on the principle that citizens of this country should have a say in the laws that govern this country. If citizens disagree with the laws, they have the power to vote for different representatives. By extending this core principle to the District of Columbia, I believe this bill would be a decisive step forward for the rights of DC residents.Now I wish to address the pending Ensign amendment.Today, we are addressing voting rights. Now is not an appropriate time to cloud the debate with amendments on gun control. Last year, when this gun issue was brought up on the Senate floor before being considered by the committee, I joined 10 of my colleagues in a letter to the majority leader asking that the bill follow Senate procedures and be referred to committee before consideration on the floor.As the chairman of the subcommittee charged with the oversight of the District of Columbia, I am familiar with the debate on DC's gun policies. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court in the Heller decision struck down the District of Columbia's gun ban. Since then, the DC City Council has taken necessary steps to comply with the Supreme Court's decision, including the passage of legislation to address issues raised by the ruling. I do not believe any congressional action is needed to help DC comply with the Heller decision, but, more importantly, this is not the appropriate time to consider and vote on this issue.I am not against gun ownership. I am for self-determination. I strongly encourage my colleagues to give the District of Columbia and its citizens the opportunity to vote on and establish their own rules regarding gun control. It would be ironic if we were to with one hand finally give the people of the District voting representation but on the other hand take away their right to self-determination by forcing them to adopt a gun control policy on which they were unable to vote. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to vote no on the Ensign amendment and all related amendments.I am proud to lend my support for the underlying bill. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of voting rights for the residents of the District of Columbia and to reject any amendment that would abridge those rights or is not germane to the issue at hand.Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "title": "REMEMBERING SENATOR EDWARD M. KENNEDY",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend from Massachusetts, Senator Edward Moore Kennedy, who improved the lives of so many people during his 46 years of service in the Senate. My warm aloha and prayers continue to be with Vicki Kennedy, staff members, the Kennedy family, and his many friends.Senator Kennedy's extraordinary life-long commitment to public service produced a proud legacy that has included expanding access to quality of health care and education, protecting and empowering our Nation's workforce, ensuring civil and voting rights, and protecting our Nation's natural and cultural resources.Before outlining several of Senator Kennedy's important achievements, I want to share a story that demonstrates our shared commitment to helping working families and his optimistic outlook about the future despite temporary disappointments. A beaming Senator Kennedy flagged me down on the morning of March 2, 2005. He asked me if I had seen the Washington Post. In an editorial criticizing the bankruptcy overhaul under consideration in the Senate, the Post indicated the bill could be made more fair by the inclusion of several amendments by Senator Kennedy intended to protect consumers and my amendment to better inform consumers about the true costs associated with credit card use. After my amendment was defeated, Senator Kennedy was the first member to approach me. He complimented me for my work and told me that we would win on the amendment one day. Senator Kennedy was right. It took me another four years, but my credit card minimum payment warning and credit counseling referral legislation was enacted this May as part of the credit card reform law.As an eternal optimist, Senator Kennedy never stopped advocating for the causes so important to working families such as increasing access to quality health care. Senator Kennedy helped establish community health centers, the Children's Health Insurance program, and programs that assist individuals suffering from HIV/AIDS. These are just a few of the many health accomplishments that Senator Kennedy helped bring about that improve the quality of life for millions of people in our country. Despite continuing to battle cancer, Senator Kennedy's passion to expand access to quality health care never ceased.Senator Kennedy had an enormous impact on education policy. He championed early childhood education through his support of Head Start and creation of Early Head Start. His work in reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act included improvements such as the Star Schools Program Assistance Act, which improves instruction in critical areas such as mathematics, science, and foreign languages, as well as the No Child Left Behind Act, which requires standards-based assessments for elementary and middle school students among other reforms. With regard to higher education, Senator Kennedy supported the creation of the Pell Grant program, Direct Lending program, and Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act to aid Americans in paying for college. Throughout his efforts in education policy, he recognized the needs of underserved populations, and endeavored to make education more affordable. I also appreciated his working with me on the Excellence in Economics Education authorization and subsequent funding requests so that more children could be better prepared for the financial decisions they will have to make as consumers, investors, and heads of households.I also greatly appreciate all of the work done by Senator Kennedy to improve the lives of members of our Nation's workforce. Senator Kennedy helped increase the Federal minimum wage 16 times. He fought for strong workplace health and safety standards, promoted equal pay for equal work, and secure retirement benefits. Senator Kennedy believed the right of workers to unionize and bargain collectively was fundamental and was always a tireless advocate for this cause. In addition, Senator Kennedy was a champion of our Federal workers and opposed efforts to outsource Federal jobs and erode workers' rights. I recall his staunch opposition to weaken the a rights of Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security employees and his strong statements in support of granting Transportation Security Administration Security officers real rights and protections.Senator Kennedy's career-long dedication to ensuring civil and voting rights helped bring about numerous changes that have made our country stronger, more equitable, and just. He condemned the poll tax, led efforts to lower the voting age to 18, and removed voting barriers. His fierce and noble opposition to discrimination by race, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, or religion guided much of his work.Senator Kennedy's advocacy for natural and cultural resources helped advance the protection of our environment for our benefit now and into the future. He was an important supporter of energy efficiency programs, including those that aid Americans most in need, and he helped improve fuel economy standards and energy research and development. His work led to the enhanced preservation of numerous treasured resources in Massachusetts including the Minute Man National Historic Park, the Taunton River, the New England Scenic Trail, the Freedom's Way National Heritage Corridor, the Boston Harbor Islands, the Quinebaug-Shetucket National Heritage Corridor, Essex National Heritage Area, and the Lowell National Historical Park.In addition to his accomplishments and advocacy on behalf of the people of our country, I will remember Ted Kennedy as a true friend, always generous with his assistance and time. For many years, my desk was next to Senator Kennedy's. He welcomed me to the Senate and always provided sound advice and guidance.In 1990, despite the long journey, Senator Kennedy came to Hawaii to help me during my first Senate campaign. I remember the rally that we held in Honolulu at McKinley High School as being one of the largest ever held in Hawaii. We also had a memorable visit to an early childhood development program. Footage of the event was recently replayed on the news in Hawaii, showing Senator Kennedy and me singing Itsy, Bitsy, Spider with the children.We toured Kapiolani Children's Hospital where we saw the devastating effect that crystal meth was having on families.Senator Kennedy visited the University of Hawaii's John F. Kennedy Theatre, where he received an award for his work on health care. He spoke eloquently about our Great Country, Congressional debates, civil rights, and economic empowerment programs.I, along with every Member of this body, will very much miss our friend from Massachusetts. Senator Kennedy's extraordinary work has improved the quality of life for so many people.We can honor his memory by continuing to work to address the issues Senator Kennedy was so passionate about such as meaningful health care and immigration reform.I say aloha to my good friend and colleague, Senator Kennedy.Mr. President, I yield the floor.",

    "title": "COPS HIRING PROGRAM FUNDING",
    "text": "Mr. President, I support the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2010. This bill's priorities will protect America from terrorism and violent crime; create jobs for Americans by investing in the Nation's scientific infrastructure and in new technologies; and ensure a timely and accurate 2010 decennial census.In Hawaii, as in the rest of the Nation, sexual and domestic violence unfortunately persists, bringing with it the need for programs and services that address such violence and meet the needs of victims. For nearly four decades, the Sexual Assault Response Services of the Hawaii County and Kauai County YWCAs, have offered a 24/7 sexual assault hotline, 24/7 on-call crisis intervention, and support for victims of sexual assault and violence through the medical examination and legal services process, individual/group therapeutic counseling, and case management. I am therefore thankful that this bill includes $400,000 to enable the Hawaii and Kauai County YWCAs to continue their critically needed services.Like other political jurisdictions across the Nation, Hawaii has pursued collaborative, community based delinquency prevention programs targeted to at-risk youth. To address this need the bill includes $300,000 for Ka Wili Pu (Native Hawaiian for ``the blend'') a project that would provide 400 at-risk youth on Maui with adult guidance and adult role models and one-on-one instruction to bolster their self-esteem, self-confidence, school attendance, and academic performance and dissuade them from becoming truants and dropouts. By encouraging at-risk youth to remain in school, fulfill their promise, and avoid a problematic future with few meaningful options, Ka Wili Pu promotes a healthier and more stable society.Recognizing that children and elderly adults can become lost and disoriented in the urban and suburban areas of Hawaii, $500,000 is provided for A Child Is Missing--ACIM--Hawaii. ACIM currently operates in 49 States but not in Hawaii, where its advanced telephone-based computer system only recently became available. That system can place 1,000 phone calls every 60 seconds to residences and businesses in the area where a missing child or adult was last seen. This initiative will provide that critical rapid response to assist law enforcement agencies in Hawaii to locate missing children and adults.I am also pleased that $500,000 was included in this legislation for the State Courts Improvement Initiative of the National Center or to Courts, NCSC. The NCSC was founded in 1971 by the Conference of Chief Justices, CCJ, the Conference of State Court Administrators, COSCA, and former U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. Today, the NCSC serves as a think tank, forum, and voice for 30,000 judges, and 20,000 courthouses, in the State court system in the 50 States, DC, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, where annually 98 percent of court filings are submitted. This request funds the implementation of the NCSC's State Courts Improvement Initiative, which will increase support services to judges, administrators and other personnel in the state court system. Improving the operations of the state courts will help shape Americans' understanding of and confidence in the Nation's judicial system.Because there may be Hawaii prisoners with credible claims to actual innocence who have exhausted their appellate rights and their rights to counsel, the bill includes $300,000 for the Hawaii Innocence Project. Founded in 2005 by Hawaii attorneys in partnership with the William S. Richardson School of Law, this project, in which law students work alongside practicing criminal defense attorneys, provides pro bono assistance to Hawaii prisoners who no longer have access to legal resources but who may be innocent of the crimes for which they were convicted, and whose innocence may now be proven through technology unavailable at the time of their trials. The possible exoneration of any wrongfully convicted individual will help to serve the cause of justice.The Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, acknowledges that immigrant women, particularly indigent women, are a specific and often overlooked at-risk group. In Hawaii, the Hawaii Immigrant Justice Center, HIJC, is the only agency providing pro bono civil legal services to indigent immigrants, particularly immigrant women who are victims of sexual assault and domestic violence. For many years, the HIJC has coordinated and delivered comprehensive assistance to indigent immigrant women through a cost-effective delivery of legal, medical, psychological, and social services that would otherwise have required the intervention of a range of other public agencies and at far greater cost. I am pleased that this bill includes $200,000 for the HIJC to enable the agency to continue to perform its good work, which not only assists immigrant victims of sexual violence but places them on a path to self-sufficiency that will, in time and over the long term, mitigate the effects of crime and promote family and social stability.All in all, the fiscal year 2010 Department of Justice-related appropriations will help Hawaii to discourage delinquency and crime, bring criminals to justice, address and meet the needs of victims, and promote a fairer and more just society.Funding included in this bill also bolsters advancements in science and technology, as well as enhances U.S. competitiveness. I am proud to have worked with Senator Inouye to secure resources that support ecosystem based management, preserve the endangered Hawaiian Monk Seal, strengthen our understanding of climate change, improve warning systems for public safety, and further science education at the 'Imiloa Astronomy Center. These programs will inform our decisions on how we manage our resources, as well as understand and interact with our natural environment.Maintaining healthy ecosystems that extend into our oceans is important. Coral reef ecosystems provide benefits by protecting coastal communities, sustaining fisheries, and preserving biodiversity. Hawaii's coral reefs generate more than $360 million a year on reef related tourism and fisheries activities. To ensure this natural resource is preserved, $2.250 million is provided in this bill to conduct studies that will enable scientists to develop predictive management tools for the conservation and management of healthy coral reef ecosystems in Hawaii and develop best practices to restore reefs where human related activities result in reef ecosystem decline. This initiative will help ensure that these reefs are protected and managed well, while also empowering coastal communities across the country to minimize human impact on our reefs.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will receive $4 million in this bill to continue the implementation of the Hawaiian monk seal recovery plan. The Hawaiian monk seal, endemic to Hawaii, is the most endangered seal in the country and one of the most endangered marine mammals in the world. In the last 50 years the Hawaiian monk seal population has fallen by 60 percent, with a current population of less than 1,200 individual seals. Funding will address female and juvenile monk seal survival and enhancement, as well as efforts to minimize monk seal mortality. Further, these funds will strengthen coordinated regional office efforts for field response teams and enhance implementation of the 2007 recovery plan.We know that there are significant effects of climate change, especially in Hawaii and the Pacific region. As island communities, sea level rise, coral bleaching, and severe weather associated with climate change have unique impacts on the public safety, economic development, and health of our ecosystems and wildlife. Fortunately, $1.5 million is provided in the bill for the International Pacific Research Center at the University of Hawaii to conduct systematic and reliable climatographic research for the Pacific. Improving our understanding of climate variability empowers us to use data and models to mitigate adverse impacts.Given Hawaii's geographic isolation, having warning systems in place to address public safety needs is critical. In order to focus on response and preparedness needs, I worked to ensure that $2 million was provided to foster the development of infrasound as a warning tool for natural hazards. As a joint initiative by the University of Hawaii and University of Mississippi, infrasound technology has the potential to minimize the catastrophic human and economic loss resulting from a natural disaster. The objective is to develop technologies for infrasound warning systems for emergency organizations and traffic control agencies. Potential applications of infrasound monitoring may include volcanic eruptions, gulf coast hurricane tracking, tsunami infrasound warning, acoustic monitoring of ocean swells, infrasonic tornado detection, and other natural disasters such as avalanches and wild fires. Development of this technology and lessons learned can help enhance existing warning systems nationwide.Developing interest in science by our Nation's youth at an early age ensures that they are better prepared to pursue and excel in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math. In an effort to cultivate a life-long interest in science and learning, $2.5 million is provided to expand astronomy and culture exhibits, as well as to develop community and educational programming at the Imiloa Astronomy Center. This endeavor is a joint initiative supported by partners including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. This program will serve as a model that integrates university/research institution resources with community learning needs using the center as a catalyst to engage and educate students and the general community. Further, this initiative increases public understanding and enjoyment of science research, while supporting the national priority of attracting more students into science and technology related fields.In conclusion, I would like to thank the senior Senator from Hawaii and the senior Senator from Mississippi, the chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the Appropriations Committee, as well as the senior Senator from Maryland and the senior Senator from Alabama, the Chairwoman and ranking member, respectively, for the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, for their support in funding these important priorities for Hawaii and for their efforts in developing and managing this bill through the legislative process.",

    "title": "OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS",
    "text": "Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for the Omnibus appropriations act for fiscal year 2010, H.R. 3288. This bill combines six appropriations bills that provide funding for essential programs related to improving education, housing, and transportation; increasing research opportunities; providing justice; strengthening our foreign operations; constructing needed military facilities; and caring for our Nation's veterans. I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senators Inouye and Cochran, as well as the various subcommittee chairmen and ranking members, for their efforts to bring this important bill to the floor.I am pleased that included in this bill is funding for a number of K-12 and postsecondary educational initiatives, as well as cultural and financial literacy efforts. These programs will benefit Hawaii and the Nation and are especially critical now when States are facing increased financial pressure. These investments in education will aid individuals and society as a whole by helping to better prepare our keiki, our children, for tomorrow's challenges.For elementary and secondary education, resources in the act support such areas as history, science, literacy, and college prep. I supported additional resources for National History Day, a program that encourages more than half a million students each year to research, synthesize, and interpret primary and secondary sources in order to create an original work for the programs' annual contest. As science, technology, engineering, and math, STEM, are four subjects whose study is critical to national goals, the Maui Economic Development Board and Kauai Economic Development Board will work to advance STEM education and careers for students from underrepresented groups on Maui and Kauai using appropriations in this act. I also joined a number of my colleagues in working to fund Reach Out and Read, a nonprofit organization that makes use of pediatric doctor's visits as a teachable moment on the importance of parents reading to their children. Additionally, the Consolidated Appropriations Act will assist programs that prepare high school students for college at Hawaii Community College, Leeward Community College, and the Pacific Islands Center for Educational Development.Included among the postsecondary initiatives in the bill are two programs at the Richardson School of Law at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, one of which comprehensively works to address issues relating to Native Hawaiians and the law and a second that will create a center on health policy. The bill will also allow the University of Hawaii at Hilo to expand programs at the Imiloa Astronomy Education Center and to establish a clinical training and applied science programs at the state's only pharmacy school.I believe that historic preservation is necessary to ensure that future generations benefit from an understanding of their heritage and that cultural programs are integral to a broad-based education in a multicultural nation and interconnected world. Therefore, I am pleased that the Henry Giugni Kupuna Memorial Archives at the University of Hawaii, Bishop Museum, and Polynesian Voyaging Society will receive funding.In addition, this bill includes vital financial education resources. My Excellence in Economic Education, EEE, Act program will receive $1.447 million for fiscal year 2010. The Triple-E funds a range of activities such as teacher training, research and evaluation, and school-based activities to further economic principles and ensure that our students are more financially literate. Financial literacy in schools is essential to ensure that students are able to be prepared to effectively participate in the modern complex economy. Moreover, I was pleased to continue my efforts in championing financial literacy efforts by backing provisions for the Council for Economic Education and Center for Civic Education.Additionally, the Department of Treasury's Office of Financial Education will have an increase of $1 million to further their efforts, revise the national strategy on financial literacy, and develop measurable goals and objectives for the Financial Literacy and Education Commission.One of the fundamental causes of the financial crisis was that people were steered into mortgages with risks and costs they could not afford or even understand. The Financial Education and Pre-Home Counseling Pilot Program was authorized pursuant to section 1132 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, Public Law 110-289. I am proud that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and I were able to secure $3.15 million for a demonstration program in Hawaii. This program will strengthen the CDFI Fund's support for a range of financial education and counseling services to prospective homebuyers and address critical financial literacy needs of families.This is a competitive grant that will be awarded by the Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. Grants awarded through the Pilot Program will have the ultimate goal of identifying successful methods of financial education and counseling services that result in positive behavioral change for financial empowerment and establishing program models for organizations to deliver effective financial education and counseling services to prospective homebuyers.The National Low Income Housing Coalition's Out of Reach report ranked Hawaii as the most expensive State for housing. As credit has become harder to obtain and downpayment requirements for home purchases have significantly increased, working families in Hawaii need assistance to better prepare for purchasing a home. These services can include credit counseling, assisting with savings planning, and educating potential home buyers about mortgage products and available programs intended to support home ownership. Pre-home ownership counseling helps prepare prospective homeowners to be better able to purchase a home and select an appropriate mortgage product and increases the likelihood that families will be able to remain in their homes. This project will focus on providing assistance to low-and moderate-income prospective home buyers in under served communities. The Government Accountability Office is required to study the impact and effectiveness of the demonstration grants authorized by section Additionally, the legislation provides necessary resources for housing and transportation. Thirteen million dollars is provided for the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant, which is administered in the State of Hawaii by the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, DHHL. These resources are extremely important to support additional home ownership opportunities for residents throughout Hawaii. DHHL is the largest housing developer in the State of Hawaii.In addition to having high housing costs, Honolulu has among the Nation's worst driving travel times. That is why I am pleased that this bill contains Federal dollars to supplement the substantial local investment in the Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project. Furthermore, I am glad that the Neighbor Islands will receive needed resources for their rural bus service. These projects will help to reduce our reliance on imported fuels that pollute our islands, promote economic development and provide additional transportation options for our State's families.A number of programs through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Consolidated Appropriations Act will also assist my State. Funding for Hawaiian monk seal recovery plan implementation furthers work to protect the less than 1,200 monk seals living today, while funds for coral reef maintenance are important to coastal communities in terms of supporting tourism, fisheries, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and shoreline protection. The bill's funding of $2 million facilitates a University of Hawaii, University of Mississippi, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and University of California San Diego consortium dedicated to employing infrasound, or low-frequency sound, as a warning tool for natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions and tsunamis, having the potential for catastrophic human and economic impacts to taxpayers. Efforts at the International Pacific Research Center, IPRC, within the University of Hawaii School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology are also supported by $1.5 million in funding. The IPRC makes data resources readily accessible and usable to researchers and the general public and conducts data-intensive climate research activities.The bill also includes provisions that will help to improve the effectiveness of State and local justice systems to enforce the laws, bring criminals to justice, address the needs of crime victims, and prevent crime and delinquency. In particular, this bill includes $500,000 for the National Center for State Courts, NCSC, which serves as a think tank, forum, and voice for 30,000 judges, and 20,000 courthouses, in the State court system in the 50 States, DC, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, where annually 98 percent of court filings are submitted. Funding in this bill will implement the NCSC's State Courts Improvement Initiative to provide increased support services to judges, administrators, and other personnel in the State court system as well as help to shape and bolster Americans' understanding of and confidence in the Nation's judicial system. I am also pleased that this bill provides $300,000 to the Hawaii Innocence Project, which provides pro bono assistance to Hawaii prisoners with credible claims of actual innocence who no longer have access to legal resources and whose innocence may now be proven by technology unavailable at the time of their trials.To address the needs of victims and prevent crime and delinquency, I am pleased that the bill provides $400,000 to enable both the Hawaii and Kauai YWCAs to continue their programs to address sexual and domestic violence and provide services for victims of such violence. It also provides $500,000 for A Child Is Missing, ACIM, Hawaii, which will provide the critical rapid response that will assist Hawaii law enforcement agencies to locate missing children and adults. In addition, $350,000 is provided for Ka Wili Pu--Native Hawaiian for ``the blend''--which will provide 400 at-risk youth on Maui with adult guidance and adult role models and one-on-one instruction to encourage them to remain in school, fulfill their promise, avoid a problematic future with few meaningful options while promoting a healthy and stable society. To help provide cost-effective legal, medical, psychological, and social services to indigent immigrant women, the bill also provides $200,000 for the Hawaii Immigrant Justice Center to help prevent violence against women.In addition to providing for our domestic needs, the bill provides critical funding to improve our foreign relations. I am particularly pleased by two programs funded by this bill: the East West Center, which will receive $23 million, and the U.S. Institute of Peace, which will receive $19.2 million. The Hawaii-based East West Center is a premier U.S. public diplomacy program focusing on Asia and the Pacific and is a vital tool to promote U.S. values and interests in the region. The funding provided by this bill will allow existing programs to continue and provide additional funds for program enhancements and some facility upgrades.The U.S. Institute of Peace, a national center of research, education, and training on conflict management, works to resolve international conflicts by peaceful means without violence and war. The USIP was championed by former Senator Spark Matsunaga, and I am pleased to see the vital work of this institution continue, especially in this current international climate.Significant funding for military construction projects is also included in this bill, which will support the construction of troop barracks, mission critical operational facilities, support the construction needs of the Guard and Reserves, and the construction of military family housing, child care centers, and chapels. We must continue to provide for our troops and their families as they sacrifice so much for this Nation.I am particularly pleased that my request for a shipyard modernization project at the Pearl Harbor Naval Station was authorized and appropriated at $25 million. Shipyard modernization is essential to give our workers the opportunity to most efficiently maintain and repair our fleet. The Production Services Support Facility is a much needed step in the right direction. In addition, my request for an additional runway at Kona was approved as funding was included for the planning and design of a C-17 short auxiliary airfield. Once completed, this will allow Hickam AFB C-17 aircrews to complete their required training in the local area instead of travelling the 16-hour round trip to the mainland.In addition to ensuring that our military members have the facilities necessary to assist in the performance of their duties, this bill ensures that our military members are taken care of when they return home. As chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am pleased that the Omnibus appropriations bill includes strong funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, in recognition of the fact that caring for veterans is a cost of war and must be funded as such.Funding for VA would be substantially increased, billions of dollars above the previous budget. This funding will allow VA to improve care for veterans of all service-eras and further the administration's goal of opening enrollment for more than 500,000 veterans of modest incomes by providing VA with the resources to prepare for them in the coming years. The bill also fully funds VA's research programs, which are vital to improving the Department's ability to treat the signature wounds of the current conflicts and develop other improvements that will help veterans and nonveterans alike.I am delighted that for the first time VA will receive advance appropriations for fiscal year 2011 for three VA medical care accounts. This coincides with the landmark legislation, Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009, which was signed into law as Public Law 111-81 by the President on October 22, 2009. Funding VA health care in advance will go a long way toward resolving the problematic underfunding of VA health care, which left so many of the Nation's veterans with unmet health care needs.Importantly, this bill contains an amendment I offered that will extend VA's authority to operate the Manila VA Regional Office. I extend my deepest thanks to the staff of the Manila Regional Office who have continued to demonstrate unwavering dedication to their duty to assist Filipino World War II veterans and indeed all veterans who apply for benefits from VA. Earlier this year, more than 60 years after the end of the World War II, surviving Filipino World War II veterans who served under U.S. military command received a measure of compensation for their service in the form of a one-time lump sum payment. Dispersing these payments has been a significant challenge as a series of steps are required to authenticate their World War II service. In addition, the Manila Regional Office administers Social Security in the Philippines while at the same time administering compensation, pension, vocational rehabilitation, employment, and education benefits to over 18,000 individuals. Without this extension, VA's authority to operate the Manila VA Regional Office would have expired on December 31, 2009.These are just some of the projects and programs this important bill will fund for the 2010 fiscal year. Once again, I want to thank the hard work of the Appropriations Committee for bringing this bill before us today, and I urge my colleagues to support it.",

    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a technical amendment to the Act of June 18, 1934, the Indian Reorganization Act.Trust land is essential to a tribe's ability to exercise their inherent sovereignty. It allows Tribal Nations to protect their historic, cultural and religious ties to the lands where their ancestors lived. Trust lands are also vital to tribal economic development and self-government as tribes provide a wide range of governmental services to their members including, running schools, community centers, health clinics, law enforcement and numerous other social and governmental services.Federal Indian policy regarding tribal lands has not always been favorable to the Tribal governments and individuals. The General Allotment Act of 1887 led to land losses of more than 100 million acres of tribal homelands. Those land losses had a devastating effect on the tribal communities, institutions and economies that relied on their homelands. Seeking to address the consequences of that ill-advised policy, Congress enacted the Indian Reorganization Act in 1934.This act was intended to reverse the prior federal policy of allotment. By passing the Indian Reorganization Act, Congress recognized that a land base was essential for the economic advancement and self-support of Indian communities. The IRA allowed tribes to restore their homelands and to rehabilitate their economies and communities. Restoration of land to tribal ownership was central to the overall purposes of the Indian Reorganization Act.Unfortunately, a recent Supreme Court decision has brought uncertainty to 75 years interpretation regarding trust land acquisition under the Indian Reorganization Act. On February 24, 2009, the Supreme Court issued its decision in the Carcieri v. Salazar case. In that decision the Supreme Court held that the Secretary of the Interior exceeded his authority in taking land into trust for a tribe that was not under Federal jurisdiction at the time the Indian Reorganization Act was enacted in 1934. The Supreme Court decided that the act only applied to tribes who were ``under federal jurisdiction'' when it was passed in 1934.The legislation I am introducing today is necessary to clarify the continuing authority of the Secretary of the Interior, under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, to take land into trust for all Indian tribes that are federally recognized on the date the land is placed into trust. The legislation also ratifies the prior trust acquisitions of the Secretary, who for the past 75 years has been exercising his authority to take lands into trust, as intended by the Indian Reorganization Act.Inaction by Congress on the Carcieri decision will create two classes of tribes--those who are considered ``under federal jurisdiction'' and can have lands taken into trust and those who cannot. Creating two classes of tribes is unacceptable and runs counter to federal Indian policy, the Indian Reorganization Act, and subsequent Congressional Acts intended to ensure that all tribes are treated equally and have the same sovereign rights. The decision will also significantly impact planned development projects on Indian trust lands, such as housing, schools, community, and health centers, and result in a loss of jobs in an already challenging economic environment.I want to thank Senators Conrad, Franken, Inouye, Johnson, Kerry, Tester and Udall for their support on this critical legislation. My cosponsors are well aware of the negative impact this decision has already had, and would continue to have on our Native American communities. Affected tribes deserve our timely consideration of this bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of this legislation.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.",

    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to oppose the Blunt amendment, which could lead to devastating health outcomes for over 20 million women across our country. Just 2 weeks ago, I applauded the Obama administration's decision to require health insurance plans to provide coverage of FDA-approved contraception needed for women's health care without copays beginning this August. The final rule issued by the Department of Health and Human Services was a tremendous step toward improving the health of our Nation's women and their families--a step that was long overdue and one made with due respect for all Americans' religious freedom.Tomorrow, we will be voting on an amendment that would not only undo that progress, it would move us backward. What is especially frightening is that this amendment goes much further than just reversing the rule because it is not limited to religiously affiliated entities. The proposal would allow any employer or health plan issuer to refuse coverage of any service for any reason, not just religious objections. If an employee had any moral objection, it would be permitted to refuse coverage for critical care such as alcohol and other substance abuse counseling, prenatal care for single women, and mental health care too. The way this measure is worded, employees could deny screening and treatment for cervical cancer because it is related to HPV or refuse HIV-AIDS testing and treatment due to an objection to ways the viruses can be transmitted. They could even refuse to cover certain FDA-approved drugs and treatments because they object to the research that led to the drug's development.Major national pediatric organizations recently voiced their concern that if this amendment becomes law, employers who say they object to childhood vaccines on the basis of personal beliefs could refuse to cover these lifesaving and otherwise costly medical services. In short, this amendment allows corporations nationwide to overrule the religious and ethical decisions made by the people they employ and to trump the health care advice of their doctors.If this amendment passes, it will discriminate against most of those who need financial support, and that is not right. All Americans deserve access to health care. We cannot allow partisan ideology to hurt the health of our women and children. If we do, our sisters, daughters, and granddaughters will pay the price. If we defeat this amendment, the final rule will save most American women who use contraceptives hundreds of dollars each year in health care costs. Health experts agree that birth control helps to save lives, prevent unintended pregnancies, improve outcomes for children, and reduce the incidence of abortion.Another point raised by my colleagues, Senators Gillibrand and Boxer--and I thank them for promoting awareness on this issue--is that 14 percent of women who use birth control pills, and that is 1.5 million American women, use them to treat serious medical conditions. Some of these conditions include endometriosis, ovarian cysts, debilitating monthly pain, and irregular cycles.Religious principles are deeply important to me as a Christian, so I am glad the current rule accommodates conscience objections and exempts religiously affiliated organizations from both offering and paying for birth control coverage for their employees. At the same time, the core principle of ensuring all women's access to fundamental preventive health care remains protected because the care will be offered directly by the insurance companies. To deny any women access to affordable health care--as this amendment would do--is unconscionable. It could have devastating effects not only on her health but her family's as well.In speaking with women's health advocates and providers in Hawaii and across the country, one of the most common recommendations I hear for improving women's health outcomes is to ensure access to effective contraception. Across the State of Hawaii about 150,000 women seek access to birth control every year, and almost half of them depend on financial assistance to obtain it. Right now, women in States that do not have plans that cover birth control face costs of around $600 per year. Women and families who cannot afford it can end up facing tens of thousands of dollars in costs arising from complications from unintended pregnancies and other health care problems, costs that taxpayers often end up supporting.With these facts in mind, I am not surprised that a survey has shown that 71 percent of American voters--including 77 percent of Catholic women voters--support the administration's requirement to make birth control available to all women. I firmly believe religious liberty is protected under the new rule, while access to preventive care does not discriminate against anyone, no matter whom they work for or what their occupation is.I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this dangerous amendment, which would set back improvements in preventive services and women's health care in this country.I yield back the remainder of my time and suggest a quorum is not present.",

    "title": "TRIBUTES TO SENATOR BARBARA MIKULSKI",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to honor and extend my warmest aloha to my longtime colleague, a fellow member of the House freshman class of 1977, and very dear friend, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, for setting a new benchmark in her career and a significant milestone in this institution: becoming the longest serving woman in the history of the U.S. Congress. With each of her many accomplishments, she inspires the next generation of young American women, and she makes their dreams that much more attainable.My colleague from Maryland has been a true trailblazer for women in Congress. In 1987, she earned the distinction of becoming the first-ever woman U.S. Senator from Maryland, as well as the first woman Democrat to serve in both the House and the Senate. Last year, she also became the longest serving female in Senate history.Barbara has not only witnessed the number of females climb from just 21 when she first came to Congress in 1977 to the 92 female members serving today, her actions and spirit helped to make that feat possible. She continues to be a distinguished leader, mentor, and friend to all of her colleagues in Congress, not just the women. Although we have more work to do to eliminate gender bias and discrimination, I am glad to see that Congress has become more representative of the United States.Throughout her over 35 years in Congress, Barbara has remained a fearless advocate for women, working-class Americans, and Federal workers across the country, a steadfast protector of the environment, and a relentless champion of civil rights in this country.Raised by Polish-American small business owners, she has been a longtime defender of labor rights and a fierce proponent of establishing fair and equal working conditions for all Americans regardless of race, sex, or disability. This cause led her to author the landmark women's and worker's rights legislation, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which I cosponsored, to guarantee women equal pay for equal work.Being from a State that, like Maryland, has a large population of Federal workers, I have worked very closely with Barbara on many issues to support our government employees. From the time that we entered the House together, she has always been a strong partner and stalwart champion for the rights of our Nation's Federal workforce, including fair pay and benefits for the dedicated men and women who make our government more secure, effective, and efficient.Barbara is an embodiment of the democratic spirit and continues to be a leader. She uses her great wit, humor, and boundless energy to urge Congress to take up important issues and then works with Members on both sides of the aisle to resolve differences and come together to achieve real solutions that help real working Americans every day. This is a testament to the fact that as she became the longest serving woman in the history of Congress, she has never forgotten her purpose--to make America better.I again want to extend my aloha and my congratulations to Senator Barbara Mikulski for this amazing achievement. It is a pleasure to serve with you. Thank you for your many years of outstanding service and genuine friendship, and I wish you the best as you continue your important work here in Congress.",

    "title": "CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET",
    "text": "Mr. President, I think it is important that we move toward our goal, that we continue to eliminate the deficit by 2002. The amendment that I am offering considers that if the revenues do not come in as projected, then there will be an automatic adjustment that would occur through the procedure set forth to hold down spending and keep the deficit from increasing.We all recognize that the economy goes through cycles. As a member of the House Budget Committee several years ago, I felt the figures coming out of the Congressional Budget Office, built on the first 2 or 3 years prior to that, were good numbers. But I have a feeling that we are reaching the top of our economic cycle and that at some point in time we will be forced to address the problem of not meeting our projected revenues.This amendment tries to address that problem. Today, the economy is strong. People have jobs and the stock market is surging. History tells us, however, that this is not always the case. Unfortunately, the budget resolution assumes economic growth over the next 5 years that is unmatched in this country's history.The Congressional Budget Office has provided Congress with a series of revised revenue forecasts, all pointing to future economic growth. In fact, balancing the budget is $629 billion easier now than last year at this time. If these revenues do not materialize, then all of our hard work will be lost to increasing deficits. I do not want this hard work to be lost. That is why I have introduced my amendment today.The concept behind my amendment is simple: Provide a means to reduce spending within this budget agreement if real revenues fall short of those projected. This amendment will decrease discretionary spending in proportion to the revenue shortfall. This would help ensure that the budget remains on the glidepath to balance by the year 2002.I am well aware of the historic nature of this agreement and would like to back the resolution with my undivided support, but I cannot mortgage the future of my children and grandchildren on Congressional Budget Office revenue forecasts. We should make sure that the document before us today has a mechanism to secure deficit forecasts. I do not believe that this change alters the intent of the agreement, but rather enhances its ability to react to changes in the economy, changes we may never see. But we cannot be shortsighted in this matter. If we are going to craft legislation to blueprint the next 5 years, let us be smart enough to realize that we cannot see into the future. Let us be smart enough to include language that allows this agreement to react to future changes.I believe we can and should do more. We should do more in the form of tax relief for the American family, more in the form of tax relief for the family farmer, more in the form of reducing waste and duplication within the Federal Government. But I also believe that we can do more in future budget debates.My amendment is not to serve as a protest, but rather a constructive improvement to a realistic budget compromise. I served on the Budget Committee in the other body and realize how difficult it was even to get to the point where we are today. But this cannot preclude us from holding true to our commitments. This amendment locks in nothing but our commitment to balance the budget.My greatest fear is that reduced future revenues will unravel this agreement, just as we have seen with similar resolutions in the past. This amendment allows for future economic changes and would only strengthen the budget resolution.The people of Colorado sent me to Washington to balance the budget and, in the process, make sure that any budget agreement keeps the Federal budget on a glidepath to balance. I ask that my colleagues hold true to balancing the budget and support this amendment.I yield my time.",

    "text": "Mr. President, today I rise to address one of the most longstanding and racially sensitive disputes in the criminal justice system. I am introducing legislation to equalize the criminal penalties for offenses involving crack and powder cocaine.Under current law, a seller of 5 grams of crack cocaine receives the same mandatory 5-year prison term as a seller of 500 grams of powder cocaine.That disparity between penalties has been scrutinized by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, Congress, and the Clinton administration for the last several years. Although many solutions have called for narrowing the gap in penalties, these recommendations don't go far enough. Instead of equalizing the penalties, they only narrow the disparity in sentencing for powder versus crack cocaine by altering the ratio from 5 to 1 instead of the current 100 to 1.Additional recommendations have called for lessening the penalty for crack dealers, bringing it closer to the lax penalties applied to powder offenders.My legislation rejects the hollow solution of lowering the penalty for crack to make it equal to powder cocaine penalties. The fact is that 90 percent of those convicted of dealing crack are African-Americans, while the majority of powder cocaine offenders are white.Raising the powder cocaine penalties to that of crack will help alleviate the perception of unfairness and racial bias in sentencing. But reducing the penalties for crack cocaine would only increase violent crime and harm those which the law is seeking to help.Statistics remind us that cocaine addiction continues to plague our society. According to the Partnership for a Drug Free America, 1 out of every 10 babies born in the United States is born addicted to drugs, and most are addicted to crack cocaine. Crime exploded between 1985 and 1990, the years crack was introduced. In fact, violent crime went up 37 percent in 1990 and aggravated assaults increased 43 percent. Partly because of crack cocaine, more teens in this country now die of gunshot wounds than all natural causes combined. Lowering sentences on crack cocaine would be devastating to the progress we have made in fighting the drug war.During the 1980's, Congress legislated steep consequences for crack cocaine.The crack epidemic spread across our Nation--and it warranted several drastic legal reforms. We saw the destruction wrought on entire communities by this cheap and highly addictive form of cocaine and realized that tough penalties were needed to restrict its availability.These tougher sentences were needed, but the problem we are seeing today is that powder cocaine sentences were set before the crack epidemic began and do not reflect the influence powder has had on crime and drug trafficking.This bill provides a twofold solution: It corrects the inequality in penalties which has contributed to the perceived race bias in sentencing; while at the same time stiffening the penalty for powder cocaine offenses, which are currently far too lenient. By Mr. BRYAN:S. 1163. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to prohibit the distribution of any negotiable check or other instrument with any solicitation to a consumer by a creditor to open an account under any consumer credit plan or to engage in any other credit transaction which is subject to that Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will protect consumers from a new, egregious banking practice that gives new meaning to the old expression, ``The check's in the mail.''This practice involves financial institutions sending unsolicited checks to consumers, some of whom have no prior relationship with the financial institution at all. These checks in fact obligate the recipient to a loan with interest rates as high as 25 percent.I invite my colleagues' attention to a format that is frequently used. This check is sent in a window envelope in which the recipient sees his or her name, opens it up and believes that indeed a check has been sent to him or to her.What may at first appear to be pennies from Heaven is in reality a loan backed by exorbitant interest rates and punitive loan terms, but these details are only found in the fine print often on the back of the check.While only a few banks are engaged in this practice, it is nevertheless a growing practice and needs to be stopped before it gets completely out of hand. For example, one bank has booked $1 billion of these unsolicited loans in a period of 18 months.At a time when personal bankruptcies are at an all-time high --many attribute that to easy credit-card debt--the practice in which consumers are enticed into taking a loan that they really have not sought should concern all Americans.I fear for the long-term consequence of these loans should the economy take a sudden downturn and these loans are left in default.The bottom line, Mr. President, is loans should only be issued when an application has been made and approved, with the consumer fully understanding the terms of the loan. In the case of these loans, all the pertinent information consumers need to know about fees, charges, interest rates is in microscopic print and most frequently on the back of the check itself.Mr. President, banks are trying the patience of the American consumer with their ever increasing use of fees and questionable market practices.My State of Nevada has gone through a series of bank mergers that have left customers frustrated and confused. Service has been downgraded, accounts lost and fees increased. According to one report, the number of types of fees charged by banks increased from 96 to 250 while the banking industry itself continues to earn record profits--surpassing $50 billion.These unsolicited checks are setting rates right up against the usury ceilings with some carrying rates as high as 25 percent. Adding insult to injury, these checks are targeted to people who can least afford to pay these exorbitant rates but are easily tempted by the lure of easy money. By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Mack, and Mr. Helms):S. 1164. A bill to state a policy of the United States that engages the People's Republic of China in areas of mutual interest, promotes human rights, religious freedom, and democracy in China, and enhances the national security interests of the United States with respect to China, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the China Policy Act of 1997. Cosponsors of this legislation include Senators Feingold, Hutchinson, Coverdell, DeWine, Ashcroft, Brownback, Mack, and Helms.Now is the time, Mr. President, to take a closer look at our relations with the People's Republic of China. Preparations are underway for the October 28 state visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin. The President will be feted, toasted, and praised. Meanwhile, Wei Jingsheng rots in a Beijing prison, serving out a 14-year sentence for the crime of peacefully advocating democracy and other political reforms.This contrast, in my view, points up the current crisis in United States-China relations. For too long now, this administration has put process over substance, holding repeated meetings and discussions with Chinese leaders, but failing to set and hold to a concrete agenda addressing critical issues of human rights and religious freedom, as well as nuclear and other weapons proliferation.There is much of substance to work out with Chinese leaders, Mr. President. To begin with, China's record of human rights abuses and repression of religious faith is long and disturbing. Women pregnant with their second or third child have been coerced into abortions. Peaceful advocates of democracy and political reforms have been sentenced to long terms in prisons where they have been beaten, tortured, and denied needed medical care. Religious meeting places have been forcibly closed. Tibetan monks refusing to condemn their religious leader, the Dalai Lama, have been forced from their monasteries; some of their leaders have disappeared.President Clinton knows full well about these abuses. His own State Department just released a report on human rights in China which states that in 1996 ``The Government continued to commit widespread and well-documented human rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws protecting basic freedoms.'' America cannot allow these abuses of fundamental human rights to continue unopposed.Our own national security also demands that we take a firmer, more substantive stance in our dealings with China. Although China signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and agreed to abide by the terms of the missile technology control regime in 1992, violations of both agreements continue. Especially worrisome are Chinese sales of weapons technology to Pakistan, Iran, and other countries in the Middle East.Chinese weapons exports also have more directly threatened Americans here on United States soil. Companies associated with the People's Liberation Army [PLA] have been caught attempting to sell smuggled assault weapons to street gangs in Los Angeles.Mr. President, I am not advocating any rash response to these provocations. China is an important nation with the potential to take part in mutually beneficial commerce and diplomatic cooperation, or destabilize a number of important strategic areas. In my view our disagreements with China call for development of incentives and disincentives designed to steer that country toward internal liberalization and constructive participation in the international community.Up until now, debates over American policy toward China have focused almost exclusively on the annual extension of that country's most-favored-nation trading status [MFN]. Both sides in this debate have highlighted legitimate issues calling for reasoned argument. But, now that Congress has renewed MFN, it is imperative that we address broader United States-China relations, lest China policy be relegated to the back pages for another year.I firmly believe, Mr. President, that Congress and the President can put United States-Chinese relations on a course toward substantive progress by taking concrete action now. That is why I am introducing the China Policy Act of 1997. This legislation is designed to discourage the Chinese regime from oppressive internal policies and destabilizing actions contrary to United States national security, while advancing American values of freedom and human rights among the Chinese people. It represents a consensus view reached among proponents on both sides of the MFN question. It combines provisions of China-related bills and amendments authored by myself and Senators Feingold, Ashcroft, DeWine, Coverdell, and Brownback. I would like to extend special thanks to Senator Feingold for strengthening the human rights focus of the bill.This legislation includes a number of sanctions aimed at Chinese leaders intended to express our dismay at recent human rights abuses. First, the bill would deny American visas to high ranking Chinese Government officials involved in political and religious persecution. The bill also would require United States representatives at multilateral development banks to vote ``no'' on all loans to China, except those related to famine, national disaster relief, and environmental protection. This last provision also puts into practice the important principle that United States taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize the Chinese Government.In addition, Mr. President, the bill would institute targeted sanctions against PLA companies found to have engaged in weapons proliferation, illegal importation of weapons to the United States or military or political espionage in the United States. The U.S. Government also would publish a list of other PLA-controlled companies. This would allow American companies and consumers to decide whether they wish to purchase products manufactured in whole or in part by the Communist Chinese army. The bill also takes direct aim at China's use of slave labor by instituting stricter enforcement of the ban against sale of Chinese products produced in prison labor camps.These sanctions, specifically aimed at government officials and the Chinese Governmental apparatus, will show our determination to stand up and defend human rights and religious freedom.This legislation also would tighten United States export licensing requirements for supercomputers sold to China. This will impede Chinese weapons development and proliferation.In addition to its sanctions, the bill includes provisions to encourage internal reforms and cultural exchanges between our two countries. It would increase funding for international broadcasting to China, including Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America. I also would increase funding for National Endowment for Democracy and U.S. Information Agency student, cultural, and legislative exchange programs.These concrete actions would make clear to the Chinese leadership that there is a price to be paid for human rights abuses and for irresponsible weapons proliferation. They also would encourage greater openness in that country, without penalizing the Chinese people for the actions of their Government. They would provide the basis for substantive negotiations and a productive relationship with China.It is my hope that my colleagues will adopt these measures, and that the President will seize the opportunity to set our policy on a new, more productive course.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary and the full text of the China Policy Act of 1997 be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill and summary were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,(a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``China Policy Act of 1997''.

(6) A determination by the President that the Government of the People's Republic of China has taken meaningful actions toward improving overall human rights conditions in China and Tibet, including the release of political prisoners, improving prison conditions, providing prisoners with adequate medical care, and full compliance with any international human rights accords to which that government is a signatory. TITLE II--HUMAN RIGHTS, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND DEMOCRACY IN CHINACongress makes the following findings regarding human rights abuses in the People's Republic of China: (1) Congress concurs in the following conclusions of the Department of State regarding human rights in the People's Republic of China in 1996: (A) The People's Republic of China is ``an authoritarian state'' in which ``citizens lack the freedom to peacefully express opposition to the party-led political system and the right to change their national leaders or form of government''. (B) The Government of the People's Republic of China has ``continued to commit widespread and well documented human rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws protecting basic freedoms''. (C) ``Abuses include torture and mistreatment of prisoners, forced confessions, and arbitrary and incommunicado detention''. (D) ``Prison conditions remained harsh [and] [t]he Government continued severe restrictions on freedom of speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, privacy, and worker rights''. (E) ``Although the Government denies that it holds political prisoners, the number of persons detained or serving sentences for `counterrevolutionary crimes' or `crimes against the state' and for peaceful political or religious activities are believed to number in the thousands''. (F) ``Non-approved religious groups, including Protestant and Catholic groups . . . experienced intensified repression''. (G) ``Serious human rights abuses persist in minority areas, including Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia [, and] [c]ontrols on religion and other fundamental freedoms in these areas have also intensified''. (H) ``Overall in 1996, the authorities stepped up efforts to cut off expressions of protest or criticism. All public dissent against the party and government was effectively silenced by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison terms, administrative detention, or house arrest. No dissidents were known to be active at year's end.''. (2) People's Republic of China authorities continue to hold Wei Jingsheng in prison for his prodemocracy beliefs, and he is suffering in prison from a lack of medical attention and beatings by fellow prisoners. (3) On October 30, 1996, a People's Republic of China court sentenced Wang Dan to 11 years in prison primarily for articles published outside the People's Republic of China, and People's Republic of China authorities are not providing him with adequate medical care. (4) In addition to Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, hundreds, if not thousands, of other political, religious, and labor dissidents are imprisoned in China for peacefully expressing their beliefs and exercising their internationally recognized rights of free association and expression. (5) Labor activist Liu Nianchun, severely ill in a labor camp, has not only been denied medical treatment but has been tortured with electric batons and has had his 3 year reeducation-through-labor sentence in prison arbitrarily extended by 216 days. (6) Li Hai was charged with prying into and gathering state secrets and subsequently sentenced to a 9-year term in prison on December 18, 1996, for going door-to-door to collect the names, ages, family situations, alleged crimes, lengths of prison sentences, locations of imprisonment, and treatment while imprisoned of people sentenced to prison for their activities during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. (7) Gao Yu, serving a 6-year term in prison on charges of ``leaking state secrets'' despite the fact that the information in question was already common knowledge, has been denied medical parole and adequate medical care despite life threatening illness and was vilified by People's Republic of China authorities after she was awarded the UNESCO Guillemo Cano World Press Freedom Prize. (8) People's Republic of China companies still export prison labor products to the United States. Since 1991, the United States Customs Service has issued 27 detention orders banning the importation of goods suspected to be products of prison labor in China, including hand tools, artificial flowers, Christmas tree lights, and diesel engines. (9) The People's Republic of China has not fully complied with the 1992 Memorandum of Understanding on Prison Labor, and People's Republic of China authorities often wait several years before granting requests by United States Customs Service officials to inspect prison facilities in China. In 1996, such authorities granted just one of eight outstanding requests by such officials to inspect prison facilities in China. (10) Under current law, People's Republic of China authorities may administratively sentence China citizens to 3 years of labor reform without trial. (11) The People's Republic of China restricts the access of its citizens to the Internet and blocks web sites operated by foreign news organizations and human rights organizations. (12) The Government of the People's Republic of China prohibits independent labor unions, and workers who attempt to form unions without state approval are given severe prison sentences as shown in the treatment of Zhang Jingsheng, a labor leader in Hunan province who was arrested following the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre and sentenced to 13 years in prison for organizing workers.Congress makes the following findings regarding religious freedom in the People's Republic of China: (1) The Government of the People's Republic of China restricts the ability of religious adherents, including Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, and others, to practice outside of state-approved religious organizations, and detains worshipers and clergy who participate in religious services conducted outside state-approved religious organizations, as well as those who refuse to register with the authorities as required. (2) Bishop Zeng Jingmu, 76 years old, detained for the third time in 7 months and in poor health from pneumonia, is serving a reeducation through labor term for organizing religious assemblies and masses not sanctioned by the official Chinese Catholic Church. (3) On January 31, 1994, Premier Li Peng signed decrees number 144 and 145 which restrict worship, religious education, distribution of Bibles and others religious literature, and contact with foreign coreligionists. (4) The Government of the People's Republic of China has created official religious organizations that control all religious worship, activity, and association in China and Tibet and supplant the independent authority of the Roman Catholic Church, independent Protestant churches, and independent Buddhist, Taoist, and Islamic associations. (5) In July 1995, Ye Xiaowen, a rigid communist hostile to religion, was appointed to head the Bureau of Religious Affairs, a government agency of the People's Republic of China that is controlled by the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party. The Bureau of Religious Affairs has administrative control over all religious worship and activity in China and Tibet through a system of granting or denying rights through an official registration system. Those who fail to or are not allowed to register are subject to punitive measures. (6) Unofficial Christian and Catholic communities were targeted by the Government of the People's Republic of China during 1996. A renewed campaign aimed at forcing all churches to register or face dissolution resulted in beating and harassment of congregants, closure of churches, and numerous arrests, fines, and sentences. In Shanghai, for example, more than 300 house churches or meeting points were closed down by the security authorities in April alone.Congress makes the following findings regarding Tibet: (1) The Department of State China Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1996 states: ``Chinese government authorities continued to commit widespread human rights abuses in Tibet, including instances of death in detention, torture, arbitrary arrest, detention without public trial, long detention of Tibetan nationalists for peacefully expressing their religious and political views, and intensified controls on religion and on freedom of speech and the press, particularly for ethnic Tibetans.''. (2) The report also cites three instances in which Tibetan Buddhist monks died in prison in the People's Republic of China in 1996. (3) Many victims of the brutality committed by the People's Armed Police and the Public Security Bureau of the People's Republic of China have been young Tibetan Buddhist nuns and monks. (4) Between June 1994 and May 1995, three Tibetan nuns--15- year-old Sherab Ngawang, 24-year-old Gyaltsen Kelsang, and 20-year-old Phuntsok Yangkyi--died as a result of torture in prison in Tibet. (5) On March 11, 1997, the Senate adopted a resolution calling for the release by the Government of the People's Republic of China of Tibetan ethnomusicologist and Fulbright Scholar Ngawang Choephel, who was sentenced to 18 years in prison in the People's Republic of China in December 1996, and of other Tibetans who are prisoners in the People's Republic of China for reasons of conscience. (6) In May 1995, authorities of the Government of the People's Republic of China detained Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, then 6 years old, and his parents, just days after the boy was recognized by the Dalai Lama as the 11th Panchen Lama, and authorities of that government continue to hold him and his family. (7) In May 1997, the Government of the People's Republic of China announced the sentencing of Chadrel Rinpoche, the head of the search committee for the 11th Panchen Lama, to 6 years in prison. (8) In April 1996, authorities of the Government of the People's Republic of China banned the display of photographs of the Dalai Lama, even in private homes, and the decision led to demonstrations in Ganden monastery during which 90 monks were arrested and 1 monk was shot to death by security forces of that government.Congress makes the following findings regarding family planning practices in the People's Republic of China: (1) For more than 15 years there have been frequent and credible reports of forced abortion and forced sterilization in connection with the coercive population control practices of the People's Republic of China. (2) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal. (3) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion and forced sterilization have no role in the population control program of the Government of the People's Republic of China, the policy of that government seems to encourage both forced abortion and forced sterilization through a combination of strictly enforced birth quotas and impunity for local population control officials who engage in coercion. Officials acknowledge that there have been instances of forced abortions and sterilization, yet there is no evidence that the perpetrators of such acts have been punished. (4) The People's Republic of China population control officials, in cooperation with employers and works unit officials, monitor women's menstrual cycles and subject women who conceive without government authorization to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic sanctions (including unpayable fines and loss of employment), and to physical force. (5) Official sanctions for giving birth to unauthorized children include fines in amounts several times larger than the per capita annual incomes of residents of the People's Republic of China. In Fujian, for example, the average fine is estimated to be twice a family's gross annual income. Families who cannot pay the fine have had their homes and personal property confiscated and destroyed. (6) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on those whose resistance to such policies is motivated by religion. For example, according to a 1995 Amnesty International report, the Catholic inhabitants of two villages in Hebei Province were subjected to population control under the slogan ``better to have more graves than one more child''. Enforcement measures included torture, sexual abuse, and the detention of resisters' relatives as hostages. (7) Forced abortions in the People's Republic of China often take place in the very late stages of pregnancy, or even during the process of birth itself.(a) Authorizations for Appropriations for Additional Monitoring of Exportation of Slave Labor Products.--There are authorized to be appropriated $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1998 and $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 for monitoring by the United States Customs Service and the Department of State of the export by the People's Republic of China to the United States of products which may be made with slave labor in violation of section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307) or section 1761 of title 18, United States Code. (b) Reports on Exportation of Products Made With Slave Labor.-- (1) Reports.-- (A) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the Commissioner of Customs and the Secretary of State shall each submit to the Members of Congress referred to in subparagraph (B) a report on the manufacturing and exportation of products made with slave labor in the People's Republic of China during the one-year period ending on the date of the report. Each report shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified annex. (B) Members of congress.--Reports under subparagraph (A) shall be submitted to the following Members of Congress: (i) The Majority leader and Minority leader of the Senate. (ii) The chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate. (iii) The Speaker and Minority leader of the House of Representatives. (iv) The chairman and ranking member of the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives. (2) Contents of reports.--Each report under paragraph (1) shall include information concerning the following: (A) The extent of the use of slave labor in manufacturing products for exportation by the People's Republic of China, as well as the volume of exports of such slave labor products by that country. (B) The progress of the United States Government-- (i) in identifying products made with slave labor in the People's Republic of China that are destined for the United States market in violation of section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 or section 1761 of title 18, United States Code; and (ii) in stemming the importation of such products. (c) Renegotiation of Memorandum of Understanding on Prison Labor With the People's Republic of China.--It is the sense of Congress that, since the People's Republic of China has substantially frustrated the purposes of the 1992 Memorandum of Understanding with the United States on Prison Labor, the President should immediately commence negotiations to replace the memorandum of understanding with one providing for effective monitoring of forced labor in the People's Republic of China, without restrictions on which prison labor camps international monitors may visit.(a) Authorization of Appropriations.--In addition to such sums as are otherwise authorized to be appropriated for ``International Broadcasting Activities'' for fiscal year 1998, there is authorized to be appropriated for ``International Broadcasting Activities'' for that fiscal year $5,000,000, which shall be available only for broadcasting by Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America to the People's Republic of China. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that United States international broadcasting through Radio Free Asia and Voice of America should be increased to provide continuous 24-hour broadcasting in Chinese and Tibetan dialects which include Mandarin Chinese, Tibetan, and at In addition to such sums as are otherwise authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 1998 for grants to the National Endowment for Democracy, there is authorized to be appropriated for that fiscal year $2,000,000 for grants to the Endowment which shall be available only for purposes of programs relating to the People's Republic of China.In addition to such sums as are otherwise authorized to be appropriated to the United States Information Agency for fiscal year 1998, there is authorized to be appropriated for the Agency for that fiscal year $2,000,000, which shall be available only for the purposes of student, cultural, and legislative exchange activities in or with the People's Republic of China.(a) Annual Reports.-- (1) Requirement.--Not later than January 15 each year, the Secretary of State shall submit to Congress a report that describes the family planning activities in the People's Republic of China during the preceding year of each covered family planning organization that carried out such activities in the People's Republic of China during that year. (2) Additional information.--Each report under paragraph (1) shall include the filing submitted to the Secretary for purposes of such report by each covered family planning organization whose activities are covered by such report. (b) Covered Family Planning Organization Defined.--In this section, the term ``covered family planning organization'' means any for-profit or non-profit entity that receives United States funds to conduct family planning activities abroad.(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) On April 15, 1997, members of the United Nations Human Rights Commission voted 27-17 to block a resolution, sponsored by Denmark, critical of the human rights record of the Government of the People's Republic of China. (2) The United States Government failed to vigorously lobby other nations to support the resolution in a timely and effective manner, and France, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia, and Japan did not cosponsor the resolution. (3) In response to support for the resolution by Denmark and the Netherlands, the Government of the People's Republic of China has adopted punitive measures against Denmark and Netherlands businesses--including the denial of contracts to Netherlands companies and undue delays in authorizing expansion plans by the Denmark shipping line Maersk--thereby linking human rights and trade. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) the United States Government should greatly increase efforts in the United Nations Human Rights Commission and other international fora to draw attention to and condemn the gross violations of international standards on human rights by the Government of the People's Republic of China; (2) the President should vigorously lobby other countries for passage of future Commission resolutions on the human rights record of the Government of the People's Republic of China; and (3) such lobbying should begin not later than 6 months before the commencement of the next annual meeting of the Commission.(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) The People's Republic of China resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997. (2) In the Joint Declaration, a legally binding document in all its parts and the highest form of commitment between sovereign states, the People's Republic of China pledged that after its resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong ``[t]he current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain unchanged, and so will the life-style. Rights and freedoms, including those of the person, of speech, of the press, of association, of travel, of movement, of correspondence, of strike, of choice of occupation, of academic research and religious belief will be ensured by law in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region''. (3) The People's Republic of China further pledged in the Joint Declaration that the policies of the ``. . . Joint Declaration will be stipulated in a Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, by the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, and they will remain unchanged for 50 years''. (4) The Basic Law prescribes the systems to be practiced in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after the resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong by the People's Republic of China. (5) According to Article 2 of the Basic Law: ``The National People's Congress authorizes the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication''. (6) According to Article 5 of the Basic Law: ``The socialist system and policies (of the People's Republic of China) shall not be practiced in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years''. (7) According to Article 27 of the Basic Law: ``Hong Kong residents shall have freedom of speech, of the press and publication; freedom of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration; and the right and freedom to form and join trade unions, and to strike''. (8) According to Article 32 of the Basic Law: ``Hong Kong residents shall have freedom of religious belief and freedom to preach and to conduct and participate in religious activities in public''. (9) According to Article 34 of the Basic Law: ``Hong Kong residents shall have freedom to engage in academic research, literary and artistic creation, and other cultural activities''. (10) According to Article 39 of the Basic Law: ``The provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and international labour conventions as applied to Hong Kong shall remain in force and shall be implemented through the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region''. (11) President Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of China, in his statement of July 1, 1997, at the ceremony in Hong Kong marking the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said that ``. . . Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy as provided for by the Basic Law, which includes the executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication''. (12) President Jiang further said that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has the ``ultimate aim of electing the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council by universal suffrage''. (13) President Jiang further said that ``[n]o central department or locality (of the People's Republic of China) may or will be allowed to interfere in the affairs which, under the Basic Law, should be administered by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on its own''. (14) President Jiang further said that ``the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and international covenants as applied to Hong Kong shall remain in force to be implemented through the laws of Hong Kong's regional legislation''. (15) President Jiang further said that adherence to these principles ``serves Hong Kong, serves the (People's Republic of China) and serves the entire nation as well. Therefore there is no reason whatsoever to change them. Here I want to reaffirm that `one country, two systems, Hong Kong administering Hong Kong' and `a high degree of autonomy' will remain unchanged for 50 years''. (16) President Jiang, in another statement of July 1, 1997, at a rally in Beijing marking the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said that the People's Republic of China ``will unswervingly carry out the principles of `one country, two systems', `Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong' and `high degree of autonomy', and make sure that the previous socio-economic system and way of life of Hong Kong remain unchanged and that laws previously in force will remain basically unchanged. We will firmly support the Hong Kong SAR in its exercise of the functions and powers bestowed on it by the Basic Law and the Hong Kong SAR Government in its administration in accordance with law.''. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) the statements of President Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of China constitute a welcome reaffirmation of the obligations of the People's Republic of China under the Joint Declaration to ensure that Hong Kong remains autonomous, the human rights of the people of Hong Kong remain protected, and the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is elected democratically; and (2) the fulfillment by the People's Republic of China of the obligations under the terms of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law constitutes a crucial test of Beijing's ability to play a responsible global role. (c) Definitions.--In this section: (1) Basic Law.--The term ``Basic Law'' means the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, as adopted on April 4, 1990, by the Seventh National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China. (2) Joint declaration.--The term ``Joint Declaration'' means the Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong, done at Beijing on December 19, 1984.Congress makes the following findings regarding the proliferation of ballistic missiles by the People's Republic of China: (1) In December 1992, the Government of the People's Republic of China violated the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act of 1979 with the transfer by the Ministry of Aerospace Industry of approximately 24 M-11 missiles to Sargodha Air Force Base in Pakistan. (2) From September 1994 to June 1996, the Government of the People's Republic of China again violated the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act of 1979 with the transfer by the Ministry of Aerospace Industry of as many as 30 M-11 ballistic missiles to Sargodha Air Force Base. (3) In June 1995, the Government of the People's Republic of China violated the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act of 1979 with the transfer by the Chinese Aerospace Corporation to Iran of possibly hundreds of missile guidance systems and computerized machine tools for the production of ballistic missiles. (4) In August 1996, the Government of the People's Republic of China violated the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act of 1979 with the transfer to Pakistan of factory plans and equipment capable of constructing a ballistic missile factory. (5) In August 1996, the Government of the People's Republic of China violated the Arms Export Control Act, the Export Administration Act of 1979, and the Iran-Iraq Arms Non- Proliferation Act of 1992 with the transfer by the China Precision Engineering Institute to Iran's Defense Industries of gyroscopes, accelerometers, and test equipment for the construction and test of ballistic missile guidance systems. (6) It has been reported that the Central Intelligence Agency discovered a shipment by the People's Republic of China to the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center, a Syria Government agency that oversees missile development, of guidance equipment for M-11 ballistic missiles. This alleged shipment would be a violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime. This alleged shipment would have taken place after the limited sanctions imposed by the United States on the People's Republic of China for shipments of M-11 missiles and components to Pakistan had been lifted following the assurances of the Government of the People's Republic of China that it would comply with the Missile Technology Control Regime. (7) After each of these violations, the President either failed to take appropriate actions to deter future violations of such Acts and the Regime, took the least onerous action against the Government of the People's Republic of China that was possible under such Acts and the Regime, or rescinded previous actions thereby diluting or eliminating the deterrent effect of sanctions under such Acts and the Regime with respect to the Government of the People's Republic of China. (8) This inaction forces Congress to take affirmative action in the bilateral relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China in order to respond sufficiently to these violations of United States law.Congress makes the following findings regarding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by the People's Republic of China: (1) In January 1996, the Government of the People's Republic of China violated the Arms Export Control Act, the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994, and the Export- Import Bank Act of 1945 with the transfer by the China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation to the Abdul Qadeer Khan Research Laboratory in Kahuta, Pakistan, of as many as 5,000 ring-magnets for the extraction of enriched uranium for the potential use in nuclear weapons. (2) In September 1996, the Government of the People's Republic of China violated the Arms Export Control Act, the Export Administration Act of 1979, and the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 with the transfer by the China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation to a nuclear reactor facility in Khushab, Pakistan, of an industrial furnace and special diagnostic equipment capable of converting plutonium and uranium to weapons grade material. (3) In March 1996, the Government of the People's Republic of China violated the Arms Export Control Act, the Export Administration Act of 1979, the Iran-Iraq Arms Non- Proliferation Act of 1992, and Executive Order 12938 with the transfer by the Jiangsu Corporation to Iran organizations affiliated with the Iranian Defense Industries Organization and the Revolutionary Guards of virtually complete chemical weapons production facilities. (4) After each of these violations, the President either failed to take any action to deter future violations of such Acts or took such trifling action as to have no meaning or effect on the future proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by the People's Republic of China. (5) This inaction forces Congress to take affirmative action in the bilateral relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States in order to respond sufficiently to these violations of United States law.Congress makes the following findings regarding the proliferation of destabilizing advanced conventional weapons by the People's Republic of China: (1) In January 1996, the Government of the People's Republic of China violated the Iran-Iraq Arms Non- Proliferation Act of 1992 with the transfer by the Chinese Precision Machinery Import-Export Corporation to the Iran military of 60 C-802 advanced anti-ship missiles and 20 Houdong fast-attack patrol craft, 15 of which were equipped with C-802 missiles. (2) In test firings of this missile from land-based batteries and from naval vessels, and test firings of a similar missile from fighter aircraft, the Iran Government claimed direct hits on the intended targets. This operational ability restores an anti-surface warfare capability lost by the Iran military during the Iran-Iraq War. (3) The Commander of the United States Fifth Fleet commented that these missiles represented a new dimension to the threat faced by the United States Navy, stating ``[i]t used to be we just had to worry about land-based cruise missiles. Now [the Iranians] have the potential to have that throughout the [Persian] Gulf mounted on ships.''. (4) It was reported in numerous press sources that the Department of Defense found these transfers destabilizing, and pressed for the imposition of sanctions under the Iran- Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 but that the Department of State did not wish to impose such sanctions for fear of damaging bilateral relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States. (5) The Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 does not differentiate between transfers of destabilizing weapons that will and will not damage bilateral relations. Any determination of whether to impose sanctions on the People's Republic of China for this transfer should have been made strictly on the basis whether this transfer was or was not destabilizing. (6) In light of these reports, it is likely that sanctions would have been imposed if the Clinton Administration had been more concerned with the stability of the region and the security of United States troops than with the maintenance of cordial relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States. (7) This inaction forces Congress to take affirmative action in the bilateral relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States in order to respond sufficiently to this violation of United States law.Congress makes the following findings regarding the evasion of United States export control laws by the People's Republic of China: (1) On November 14, 1994, the President issued Executive Order 12938, relating to the emergency regarding weapons of mass destruction, declaring that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them constitute ``an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States'' and that he had therefore decided to ``declare a national emergency to deal with that threat''. (2) The President reaffirmed Executive Order 12938 on November 15, 1995, and again on November 11, 1996. (3) The Director of Central Intelligence stated in the report entitled ``The Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions'' that, from July to December 1996, ``China was the most significant supplier of W[eapons of] M[ass] D[estruction]-related goods and technology to foreign countries.''. (4) United States supercomputers are the computer of choice for the nuclear weapons agencies of the People's Republic of China as highlighted by the comments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, an agency known to work on nuclear weapons development, that its United States-built supercomputer provides the Academy with ``computational power previously unknown'' and is available to ``all the major scientific and technological institutes across China''. (5) The People's Republic of China has consistently provided technical and scientific assistance for the development of nuclear weapons to both Iran and Pakistan, and it is illogical to believe that such assistance would not also include computational assistance if needed. (6) According to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration, 47 United States high-performance supercomputers were exported to the People's Republic of China between January 1996 and March 1997. Press reports indicate United States intelligence sources consider the actual number of such supercomputers exported to the People's Republic of China during that period to have been in the hundreds. (7) Current United States export regulations require an export license for shipments of supercomputers to the People's Republic of China only if the end-use will be militarily related. However, the determination of that end- use is left to the exporter, thereby providing an incentive for inadequate investigations of the end-use of supercomputers exported to the People's Republic of China. (8) The Department of Commerce has initiated investigations of United States supercomputer manufacturers who, as last as June 1996, allegedly sold supercomputers to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which also administers research in nuclear weapons and missiles, in violation of existing United States export control regulations relating to supercomputers. (9) On 14 July 1997, the ``China Daily'', the newspaper of the Government of the People's Republic of China, stated that ``China will open up its defense sector to foreign investors'' by ``strengthening international military-related electronic technology exchanges'' and that ``China's defense- related electronics should no longer be hidden from foreign investors''. (10) It was exactly this concern of diversion to military end-use and to third nation proliferators that prompted the President, on June 16, 1997, to tighten export controls for supercomputers so as to address the concern of ``[t]he potential diversion to military use of technology acquired'' through experience developed in operating supercomputers and customizing software and the concern that ``the People's Republic of China may transfer advanced-weapons related technology to other countries, as in the case of ballistic missile transfers''. (11) Throughout this period, the President has consistently acted in a manner so as to loosen controls on the export of supercomputers from the United States and thereby make it easier for the Government of the People's Republic of China to divert United States supercomputers to military end-uses and to assist in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. (12) This inaction forces Congress to take affirmative action in the bilateral relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States in order to respond sufficiently to these violations of United States law.Congress makes the following findings regarding the inconsistent application of United States export control laws to the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong: (1) While Hong Kong was sovereign territory of the United Kingdom, United States control of United States exports to Hong Kong of items listed on the United States Munitions List and the Commerce Control List was considerably more lax than United States control of exports of such items to the People's Republic of China. (2) On June 19, 1997, at a time when Hong Kong was still territory of the United Kingdom, the Department of Commerce discovered that a supercomputer exported to a Hong Kong based company without the need of an export license because it was being exported to Hong Kong was reexported to a defense research institute in Changsha, People's Republic of China. (3) A Federal grand jury is currently investigating the 1995 diversion by the Government of the People's Republic of China to military aviation production of aircraft machining equipment that was originally exported from the United States for civilian end-use. (4) The People's Republic of China is the only country which does not allow United States officials to investigate the final end-use of exported technology and recently refused United States requests to examine the location of the supercomputer diverted from Hong Kong. (5) The continuation of this inconsistent export control regime without specific assurances and verification measures to prevent unauthorized reexport from Hong Kong, or diversion to military end-use, provides the Government of the People's Republic of China with the means to circumvent United States export controls and gain access to critical technology necessary both for defense modernization and the proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction. (6) This inaction forces Congress to take affirmative action in the bilateral relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States in order to respond sufficiently to these violations of United States law.(a) Prior Approval of Exports and Reexports.--The President shall require that no covered computer may be exported or reexported to the People's Republic of China without the prior written approval of each of the designated officials. (b) Export or Reexport Without Unanimous Approval.--If any one of the designated officials does not approve of the export or reexport of a covered computer to the People's Republic of China, the computer may be exported or reexported to the People's Republic of China only pursuant to a license issued by the Secretary of Commerce under the export administration regulations of the Department of Commerce, and without regard to the licensing exceptions otherwise authorized under section 740.7 of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on June 10, 1997. (c) Deadline for Response to Application.--Each designated official shall approve or disapprove in writing of the export or reexport of a covered computer to the People's Republic of China not later than 10 days after receipt by the United States of the application for the export or reexport of the computer. (d) Definitions.--In this section: (1) Covered computers.--The term ``covered computers'' means the digital computers listed as ``eligible computers'' in section 740.7(d)(2) of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on June 10, 1997. (2) Designated officials.--The term ``designated officials'' means the following: (1) The Secretary of Commerce. (2) The Secretary of Defense. (3) The Secretary of Energy. (4) The Secretary of State. (5) The Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the provisions of this section shall apply with respect to exports of covered items to Hong Kong. (b) Pre-License Verifications.--The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce shall not approve an export license application for the export of a covered item to Hong Kong if United States officials are denied an opportunity to conduct a pre-license verification with respect to the end-use of such covered item and the recipient of such item. (c) Post-Shipment Verification.--If United States officials are denied the ability to a conduct post-shipment verification of the location, recipient, and end use of a covered item that has been exported to Hong Kong from the United States pursuant to an export license granted by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce, thereafter any application to export a covered item to Hong Kong shall be treated in the same manner as a request to export such item to the People's Republic of China. (d) Diversion of Covered Items.--If the President, or any other official of the United States, obtains credible evidence that a covered item exported from the United States to Hong Kong on or after July 1, 1997, has been diverted-- (1) to the People's Republic of China; (2) to an end use not authorized under the export control laws or regulations of the United States, or (3) to a recipient, other than the recipient specified in the export license application,(a) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United States that-- (1) the delivery of 60 C-802 cruise missiles by the China National Precision Machinery Import Export Corporation to Iran poses a new, direct threat to deployed United States forces in the Middle East and materially contributed to the efforts of Iran to acquire destabilizing numbers and types of advanced conventional weapons; and (2) the delivery is a violation of the Iran-Iraq Arms Non- Proliferation Act of 1992 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note). (b) Implementation of Sanctions.-- (1) Requirement.--The President shall impose on the People's Republic of China the mandatory sanctions set forth in paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) of section 1605(b) of the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992. (2) Nonavailability of waiver.--For purposes of this section, the President shall not have the authority contained in section 1606 of the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 to waive the sanctions required under paragraph (1).(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Credible allegations exist that the People's Republic of China has transferred equipment and technology as follows: (A) Gyroscopes, accelerometers, and test equipment for missiles to Iran. (B) Chemical weapons equipment and technology to Iran. (C) Missile guidance systems and computerized machine tools to Iran. (D) Industrial furnace equipment and high technology diagnostic equipment to a nuclear facility in Pakistan. (E) Blueprints and equipment to manufacture M-11 missiles to Pakistan. (F) M-11 missiles and components to Pakistan. (2) The Department of State has failed to determine whether most such transfers violate provisions of relevant United States laws and Executive orders relating to the proliferation of sensitive equipment and technology, including the Arms Export Control Act, the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994, the Export Administration Act of 1979, and the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, and Executive Order 12938. (3) Where the Department of State has made such determinations, it has imposed the least onerous form of sanction, which significantly weakens the intended deterrent effect of the sanctions provided for in such laws. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) the transfers of equipment and technology by the People's Republic of China described in subsection (a)(1) pose a threat to the national security interests of the United States; (2) the failure of the Clinton Administration to initiate a formal process to determine whether to impose sanctions for such transfers under the provisions of law referred to in subsection (a)(2) contributes to the threat posed to the national security interests of the United States by the proliferation of such equipment and technology; and (3) the President should immediately initiate the procedures necessary to determine whether sanctions should be imposed under such provisions of law for such transfers. (c) Report.-- (1) Requirement.--Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to Congress a report setting forth-- (A) the date, if any, of the commencement and of the conclusion of each formal process conducted by the Department of State to determine whether to impose sanctions under the provisions of law referred to in subsection (a)(2) for each transfer described in subsection (a)(1); (B) the facts providing the basis for each determination not to impose sanctions under such provisions of law on the Government of the People's Republic of China, or entities within or having a relationship with that government, for each transfer, and the legal analysis supporting such determination; and (C) a schedule for initiating a formal process described in paragraph (1) for each transfer not yet addressed by such formal process and an explanation for the failure to commence such formal process with respect to such transfer before the date of the report. (2) Form.--The report shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.(a) Entities Owned by PLA.--Not later than January 31 each year, the Secretary of State shall publish in the Federal Register a list of each corporation or other business entity that was owned in whole or in part by the People's Liberation Army of the People's Republic of China as of December 31 of the preceding year.

    "text": "Mr. President, I spent the month of January attending town meetings throughout the State of Colorado. That is one of the things, when I go back to my State, that I spend a lot of time doing--visiting the counties and visiting with the people of Colorado. Over the years, we continue to have the issue of taxes brought up in the town meetings--probably more so now than at any time that I can recall since having town meetings.The American people simply want to have their tax system reformed, particularly those in Colorado. They want lower taxes, they want a simpler tax system, and they want less intrusive means of collecting those taxes.Last year, Congress enacted modest tax relief, but it was only a first step. It's time to move forward with more aggressive tax reform.Today, I am introducing legislation that will do four things:It will continue to reduce the capital gains tax to a top rate of 14 percent.It will restore the one-year holding period for capital gains treatment.It will index capital gains and, thereby, eliminate the taxation of gains that are due solely to inflation.And then, finally, it will eliminate the estate tax.These changes will provide important tax relief for families and businesses, and continue to ensure that our economy remains the most competitive in the world.Mr. President, the new year has certainly brought good news concerning the Federal budget. But let's be honest. The budget is balancing because of the hard work of the American people, not because of any bold action by the Federal Government. Economic performance in recent years has exceeded all expectations. The result is that the American people have been sending greater and greater amounts of their earnings to Washington. The budget is balancing because of an explosion in tax receipts, not because of any restraint in spending. In fact, the budget continues to grow at a healthy pace. Federal spending in 1998 is estimated to be 4.3 percent above the 1997 level--well in excess of inflation. Many would like this to continue.The President assured us in a previous State of the Union Address that, ``the era of big Government is over.'' But it is clear that he is now proposing a new era of big Government.I favor a different course. We should not squander the people's surplus on more Government. Instead, we should begin to pay down the debt and reform the tax system. We should put American families ahead of the insatiable appetite of Washington, DC, for more Government spending.Despite last year's budget bill, taxes remain higher than they have ever been. Tax freedom day--the day to which the average American works to pay the combined Federal, State, and local tax burden--is May 9, which is the latest it has ever been. A reduction in the Federal debt and a reasonable level of taxation should be the twin objectives of Congress as we enter the next century. Our job is to ensure that the bridge to the 21st century does not become a toll bridge.Mr. President, let me begin with a discussion of capital gains taxes. I call the capital gains tax the ``growth tax.'' Nearly all Americans own capital, and they experience a tax on that capital when they sell the stocks, or a small business, or a farm.Mr. President, let's look at how this capital gains, or growth tax, hits ordinary working Americans. Stock ownership has doubled in the last 7 years, to the point where 43 percent of all adult Americans own stock. Obviously, with those numbers, stock ownership is not just confined to the wealthy; it is spread throughout society. Today, half of the investors are women, and half are noncollege graduates. Stocks are typically held for retirement, education expenses, and other long-term goals. This is precisely the type of saving and investing that we need in our economy.Mr. President, I can't leave this topic without talking about small business owners and farmers. There is no clearer area where the ``growth tax'' makes no sense. Millions of American families put their lives into building small businesses and farms. Often, those businesses or farms are sold to finance a decent retirement. But this can only occur after Uncle Sam gets his cut of one-third or more of all the gains.Simply put, low taxation makes it less costly to take the risks that are critical in a capitalist economy. I am proposing that we enact a maximum capital gains tax of 14 percent, with those in the lowest tax bracket paying only 7 percent. Last year's reduction of the capital gains rate was a big plus, but it came with a price--the holding period required to qualify for the lower tax was extended from 12 months to 18 months.The holding period change is a poor attempt by the Government to micromanage the economy. This is the type of Government management that has so clearly failed in Asia. A market economy functions best when capital flows freely, unencumbered by Government distortions. The holding period for long-term capital gains treatment has been 12 months for years, and it should stay that way.Mr. President, an additional mistake that Congress made in last year's bill was a failure to include indexing. The real ``growth tax'' is often much higher than 20 percent. This is because our Tax Code does not protect Americans from taxation on capital gains that result from inflation. This is one of the most unfair aspects of the growth tax. Government policies contribute to inflation, and Government turns around and taxes its citizens on that inflation.For this reason, I fought hard to see that indexing was included last year. I offered an amendment to the tax bill that would have added indexing. The amendment was carefully structured to avoid any revenue loss. Obviously, I was disappointed with the defeat of this amendment. I presume that this was due largely to the President's opposition to indexing and his veto threat. Despite this, we got a strong vote, and I promised that I would be back.I have included indexing in this bill, and I fully intend to offer this at each opportunity. Some have dismissed indexing as ``too costly,'' but for me this is an issue of fundamental fairness. It is wrong for the Federal Government to tax citizens on inflation.Since I mentioned the issue of cost, let me make a few points on this. I have long maintained that a capital gains tax cut will increase revenue. In the short run, it encourages the sale of assets that would not otherwise occur. This obviously increases revenue.In the long run, a rate cut facilitates a higher level of economic growth. This also results in greater tax revenue.Unfortunately, during last year's tax debate, we continued to operate under revenue models that forecast a loss to the government from the capital gains rate cut.I hope we can soon put this notion to rest for good.It is already apparent that capital gains revenues will be coming into the Treasury at a considerably higher level than forecast last year when we were talking about capital gains. 1998 capital gains revenues could be as much as 50% higher than previously forecast.Even state governments will benefit from the rate cut. Earlier this month, analysts for the Colorado Legislature forecast that the capital gains tax changes would result in an additional $38 million this year for the Colorado state budget.Obviously, the impact at the federal level will be many times greater.The final provision in this tax bill is the elimination of the estate tax.Frankly, the estate tax makes no sense.While the tax raises only 1 percent of federal revenues, it destroys family businesses and farms.The estate tax is double taxation.At the time of a person's death, much of their farm, business, and life savings has already been subjected to federal, state, and local tax. These same assets are taxed again under the estate tax.The estate tax fails to distinguish between cash and non-liquid assets.Family businesses are often asset-rich, and cash poor. But the value of all assets must be included in the taxable estate.This can force liquidations, and family businesses can see their livelihood eliminated in order to pay a tax of up to 55 percent. Yes. That is right--up to 55 percent.This practice threatens the stability of our families and communities while inhibiting growth and economic development.The National Center for Policy Analysis reports that a 1995 survey by Travis Research Associates found that 51 percent of family businesses would have difficulty surviving the estate tax, 14 percent of business owners said it would be impossible to survive, 30 percent said they would have to sell part or all of their business.This is supported by a 1995 Family Business Survey conducted by Matthew Greenwald and Associates which found that 33% of family businesses anticipate having to liquidate or sell part of their business to pay the estate tax.Recently, the accounting firm Price Waterhouse calculated the taxable components of 1995 estates. While 21% of assets were corporate stock and bonds, and another 21% were mutual fund assets, fully 32% of gross estates consisted of ``business assets'' such as stock in closely held businesses, interests in non-corporate businesses and farms, and interests in limited partnerships. In larger estates this portion rose to 55%.Clearly, a substantial portion of taxable estates consists of family businesses.The recent tax bill increased the estate tax exemption from $600,000 to $1 million. However, this is done very gradually and does not reach the $1 million level until 2006. The bill also increased the exemption amount for a qualified family owned business to $1.3 million. While both actions are a good first step, they barely compensate for the effects of inflation. The $600,000 exemption level was last set in 1987, just to keep pace with inflation the exemption should have risen to $850,000 by 1997.Incremental improvements help, but we need more substantial reform. It is time to eliminate this tax entirely. This action has been taken in countries such as Australia and Canada. Unfortunately, the United States retains what are arguably the highest estate taxes in the world.Among industrial nations, only Japan has a higher rate than the U.S. But Japan's 70% top rate applies only to inheritance of $16 million or more. The U.S. top rate of 55% kicks in on estates of $3 million or more. France, the United Kingdom, and Ireland all have top rates of 40%, and the average top rate of OECD countries is only 29%.Repeal of the estate tax would benefit the economy. George Mason University Professor Richard Wagner estimates that within seven years of elimination of the estate tax the output of the country would be increased by $79 billion per year, resulting in up to 228,000 new jobs. Under the current system, the energy that could go into greater productivity is expended by selling off businesses, dividing resources and preparing for the absorption of an estate by the government. Those businesses that survive the estate tax often do so by purchasing expensive insurance. A 1995 Gallup survey of family firms found that 23% of the owners of companies valued at over $10 million pay $50,000 or more per year in insurance premiums on policies designed to help them pay the eventual tax bill.The same survey found that family firms estimated they had spent on average over $33,000 on lawyers, accountants and financial planners in order to prepare for the estate tax.Ironically, the estate tax is often justified on the grounds that it helps to equalize wealth. But this effect is greatly exaggerated. A 1995 study published by the Rand Corporation found that for the very wealthiest Americans, only 7.5% of their wealth is attributable to inheritance--the other 92.5% is from earnings.Mr. President, it is time to repeal this outdated tax. We must insist that no more American families lose their business because of the estate tax. We must ensure that when a family is coping with all the inevitable costs of passing a business from one generation to the next, the Federal Government is not there as an added burden. By Mr. WELLSTONE:S. 1636. A bill to provide benefits to domestic partners of Federal employees; to the Committee on Finance.Mr. President, last October, Congressman Barney Frank broke new ground when he introduced HR2761, the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act of 1997. I am here today to break ground in the Senate by introducing the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act of 1998. This bill does not introduce new benefits; it simply extends existing benefits to a previously uncovered group of employees for very little cost.Mr. President, let me take a moment to outline my bill. This bill provides benefits for same-sex domestic partners of civilian, federal employees. Partners must be living together, in a committed, intimate relationship, and responsible for each other's welfare and financial obligations. It provides access to five categories of benefits in the same way that married spouses have access: participation in retirement programs, life insurance, health insurance, compensation for work injuries, and upon the death of a government employee, the domestic partner would be deemed a spouse for the purpose of receiving benefits.This is a bill about justice, about fairness, about equity in the workplace. This bill is about saying to our gay and lesbian employees, ``We value your contribution to the workplace, and to show you we value you, we're going to protect your families, like we protect the families of married employees, by providing them with benefits.'' It is about providing the opportunity for same-sex domestic partners to provide their partners--who previously have been denied--access to such benefits as health insurance.For many people in this country, insurance benefits for their loved ones are automatic, they are expected, they are the norm. But benefits didn't start out that way. In fact, they are a relatively modern invention. Benefits in the form of compensation were created in the 1940's, essentially to increase compensation for some employees who were prohibited by law from getting pay increases. So instead of more pay, employers paid for certain products and services such as health insurance to take care of their employees and to make their businesses more attractive to potential employees. For gay men and lesbians, most of these benefits are completely inaccessible.But where is it written in stone that only married spouses and their children deserve benefits? Yes, many employers have chosen to limit benefits to married spouses and their children, but more and more, governments, universities, and private businesses have been making a different choice. Business and organizations like the San Francisco 49ers, Reader's Digest, Starbucks, Coors, Ben and Jerry's, Kodak, Disney, the Union Theological Seminary, the Episcopal Diocese of Newark, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers #18, Mattel, the Vermont Girl Scout Council, and more than 50 Fortune 500 companies have made the right choice to offer domestic partnership benefits. A more fair and equitable choice. A more humane choice.I am disappointed that domestic partnership benefits have already been offered in some cities and by some businesses since 1982 but here we are in 1998 and we're just now talking about them here in the Senate. Today there are at least 42 cities and municipalities, 12 counties, 1 state, and 342 private sector for-profit and not-for profit businesses and unions which offer domestic partner benefits. The good news, though, is that we have more than 15 years worth of employers' experiences with providing these benefits.By virtue of our vote on DOMA, we have said that same-sex couples cannot marry. But that doesn't mean that people in long-term, loving, and committed relationships don't deserve to have the opportunity to provide their loved ones with health insurance, survivor benefits, and other benefits. Domestic partnership legislation levels the playing field for same-sex partners who are not allowed to marry. This bill is aimed at correcting that inequity. Here is the story of how not having domestic partnership benefits effected one couple's lives:Anonymous: My partner and I have been together for almost six. About a year ago, he had to leave work due to a serious heart condition. Since my employer doesn't include domestic partnership benefits, we had to pay all of his expenses out of pocket. For quite some time I had to support him from my salary, or else he would have ended up on welfare. We are still scrimping and saving to try and pay off the health care expenses that should have been covered by my insurance (if we had dp benefits). Almost all of my heterosexual friends have been ``married'' less time than my partner and I and received benefits immediately after the marriage. Their relationships seem no more permanent than my own. When my partner and I have been together for fifty years, we will still not have insurance for him through my employer.Not only are domestic partnership benefits fair and just, they cost very little. Employers have found that upon implementing domestic partnership benefits, one percent of all employees--at most--actually sign up their same-sex partners for benefits. And more often, it is less than one percent. Even taking the most liberal figures, there is no legitimate reason to argue that more than 1% of our almost 300,000 federal civilian employees will enroll. And even though this is a relatively small number of employees--at most 30,000--let me tell you, these benefits are of critical importance to those who do.For example, Marieta Louise Luna is a graduate student studying in the Divinity School at Duke University. She says,I just returned home from the hospital on Thursday night from having a knee replacement made possible largely because of the fact that Kathryn is a Duke employee and I have domestic partner benefits. Guaranteed, I could not have had the surgery if I had not had domestic partner benefits. For me, it was the literal difference between walking and being handicapped for the next several years.And at a cost of less than 1% of the total benefits budget--or less--it is truly worth making this investment.Some might be afraid that domestic partnership policies could open the door to fraud with people signing up their friends in order to get health insurance.Most employers never ask for verification of a heterosexual marriage. I have never been asked to provide a marriage certificate to prove I'm married, and I doubt that many of you have either.But my bill has stringent requirements for qualifying as domestic partners. Among other requirements, partners must sign an affidavit certifying that they share responsibility for a significant measure of each other's common welfare and financial obligations. And they must show documentation to prove it--such as copies of a mortgage or lease with both names on it, copies of bank statements showing joint checking or savings accounts, copies of durable powers of attorney for property and health, or copies of wills specifying each other as the major recipients of each other's financial assets.In addition, my bill specifies serious consequences for fraud, including the possibility of disciplinary action, termination of employment, and repayment of any insurance benefits received.Finally, there are criminal statutes that provide that making false statements and defrauding the government are crimes which can result in a fine and/or imprisonment up to 5 years.The bottom line is that this bill creates serious consequences for fraud, establishes that every effort will be made to minimize fraud by those falsely claiming to be domestic and specifies that those caught will be seriously punished.Let me tell you one more story:Anonymous from Minnesota: I have had the same health care benefits package for nearly 16 years. I began family coverage when I married in 1978. Our two children were added when they were born. My ex-husband remained on my insurance policy after we divorced--at no additional cost--even though we were not legally married. I am now in a committed lesbian relationship. My partner had been teaching part-time in a private school for two years before she became eligible for health insurance through her employer. Two weeks before her insurance was to take effect she was stricken with severe abdominal pain. Though we considered ``toughing it out'' until her insurance kicked in, it became increasingly clear that she needed to be treated immediately. She had a large, twisted ovarian tumor removed. By the time of the surgery, her insurance was in place. We breathed a sigh of relief. Months later we learned that because her pain started (and was briefly treated) before her insurance began, the claim for coverage for the surgery and hospital stay were disallowed because there was a pre-existing condition exclusion in her insurance policy. We are now faced with over $5,500 (plus 12% interest per year) in medical bills. This may not seem like a lot of money to some people, but it certainly is to us. And it's money that wouldn't have had to be spent at all if she had been on my family coverage all along. So why is it that my ex-husband (no legal relation) was entitled to continue receiving benefits until he married, but my life partner has had to go without medical insurance? The answer is simple--discrimination.This is a bill about fairness. This is about equity in the workplace. This is about protecting employees' loved ones. It's the right thing to do.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Additional Stories Regarding Domestic Partnership BenefitsAdditional Stories Regarding Domestic Partnership Benefits Wendy I. Horowitz: My partner was ill for almost a year. I worked for a large conservative company that never considered implementing domestic partner benefits. After seeing one of my co-workers get married and have instant coverage for her husband (after they had been married for a day), I decided to apply for benefits for my partner. They were denied. Her illnesses were related to her tonsils, and the doctors suggested that she have them removed. I had to come up with the money to pay for this surgery (over $4,000 by the end of it all), which put a great financial burden on us and on our relationship. Jim and Hal: As an employee of the State of Maryland (through my graduate assistantship), I receive comprehensive health benefits. Although I could share my benefits with a married spouse, I am not able to do a thing for my partner Hal. Hal is another ``starving student''; he is in a doctoral program at American University. Unfortunately, American does not offer full health coverage to its graduate assistants, so Hal is having to make do with emergency health coverage. This has adversely affected us in two ways. First, we have to cover Hals' regular health maintenance (e.g., dental checkups) which is a strain on our already stretched budget. Second and more importantly, Hal has a heart problem for which regular appointments with a cardiologist are recommended. We are not in a position to pay specialist fees out-of-pocket; thus, we are unhappily have to settle for doctors at American University's health center. U Minnesota: R and S are their late 30's, and they have been in a committed relationship for 20 years. S is self- employed as a psychotherapist and is registered with the University as R's domestic partner. Four years ago, R gave birth to the couple's first child L. R was able to put L on her health insurance policy as a dependent. The couple incurred no additional cost or additional deductibles for L's birth or subsequent medical treatment. Three years later, S gave birth to the couple's second child M. Because the University only recognizes formal adoption (not guardianship) for direct dependent coverage, M is only listed as S's child and not R's child. Since the University's domestic partnership plan only provides medical premium reimbursement for partners and their dependents, R and S incurred significantly higher costs for M's birth than for L's birth. Specifically, the couple pays out $526 every 3 months for S and M's insurance policies which each have a $500 deductible (the University plan has no deductible and low copays for dependent care). Reimbursement from the University for this cost takes additional 3 months after the couple pays. Due to IRS regulations, which do not recognize the partners as a couple, the University's reimbursement to the employee is taxed. The end result of all the complications of this system for the couple is that they have $1,500 in outstanding debt for unreimbursed health premiums. In addition, they were charged $1,000 in deductibles plus higher copays for M's birth. They have had to take out a loan to cover these health care related expenses. Becky Liddle: I am a tenured associate professor. My domestic partner quit her job and moved here to Alabama in June of '97, as the ``trailing spouse'' in a dual career couple. We thought she would find work very quickly. But due in part to sexual orientation discrimination in hiring, she has been unable to find professional work and health benefits. She is working full-time for Kelly Services, which does not include health benefits. We brought her a 4-month hospitalization policy before she quit her job, assuming that would be more than enough time--it wasn't. She has no health insurance. We have looked at policies she could buy herself, but they are extremely expensive, and cover very little. My university will not allow me to put my domestic partner on our insurance (in fact, Blue Cross of Alabama explicitly states in its policy that ``spouse'' is limited to someone of the opposite sex). Consequently, every time she gets sick it is a crisis, and we make potentially life-threatening choices about whether she should go to the doctor. For example, she got pneumonia a few weeks ago. This is, she had all the symptoms of pneumonia, according to our Time/Life ``medical advisor--complete guide to alternative &amp; conventional treatments'' book, which has become her primary care ``physician''. The book said if it was viral she should just go to bed, but if it was bacterial it could be life threatening. It appeared from her symptoms to be viral, so we did not spend the money to go to a doctor. This time we were right. She recovered fine in about a week. Of course, if we'd been wrong, she could be dead. I think we make good decisions about how to spend our limited health-care dollars. But I ought to be able to put her on my insurance. Eva Young: I live with my partner of 10 years in Minneapolis. I have benefits through my work place. Even though the University of Minnesota offers ``domestic partnership'' benefits, these don't work for us. To be able to get pretax benefits (analogous to what a married couple get), we would have to declare my partner a dependant. This is degrading to my partner. Although I currently have a better job than she does (it pays better and is permanent), it doesn't mean we should have to declare her a dependant (with all the negative connotations that has) in order to get the benefits we are both entitled to. To add insult to injury, I am taxed at the single rate, even though I am primary breadwinner for a family of 4. I consider this an equal pay for equal work issue. Why should I get paid less than my married coworker, just because I am not legally married? Not having the same benefits that a heterosexual married couple keeps my family in poverty. My family would not be in poverty if we had the same rights as married couples do. It's that simple. This isn't something that is just for the gay couple--it also will affect a lot of children. Actually, domestic partnership will do little for the dual career gay couple, where both individual are in good jobs--it's going to make a difference for gay couples who have families, or have one partner who is uninsured. Allowing gay couples to insure their partner and partner's children through their workplace insurance could also help some individuals get off government assistance. Kirk A. Nass: My domestic partner and I have been together nearly 14 years. My partner, Michael E. Gillespie, was an attorney in Seattle when we met, now he is self-employed and runs a business in Oakland which provides physicians as expert witnesses to lawyers and insurance companies for plaintiff work. Michael's past employers never provided good medical coverage, if they provided it at all. In 1989 I finished graduate school and started a job with Chevron. Michael quit his job to move with me to the San Francisco Bay Area. Chevron provides excellent health coverage to its employees, but I was unable to cover him because domestic partners were not eligible for coverage at the time. The prospect of him having a major medical event and us not being able to pay for it bothered me for years. After starting his own business five years ago, he joined an HMO (Kaiser Permanente, No. Calif.) under an individual plan. In 1995 he was diagnosed with Type II diabetes; in 1996 he suffered a heart attack and underwent an angioplasty to open the blocked artery. Because of his HMO coverage, all of his diabetes care, his stay in intensive care, and the angioplasty were covered. He's now in excellent health. If his business failed--even if he still worked for some of his past employers--we would not have had the financial resources to pay for his cardiac care. On Jan. 1, 1998, Chevron began extending medical and dental coverage (and some other benefits) to the same and opposite sex domestic partners of employees and the partners' eligible children. The coverage Chevron provides for Michael through Kaiser is even better than what he was paying for himself at Kaiser. It's the first time since we've been together he's had full coverage and the first time I haven't had to worry. Having domestic partners benefits such as medical coverage is important to us because it makes me sure that the most important person in my life can be taken care of when he needs to be. The experiences we've gone through together, although they've led to successful conclusions, have shown too often that ``what-if'' scenarios can be all too real. Dan Ross: My partner of 5 years has cerebral palsy (a congenital condition; in his case, it creates overly-tight muscle tone). After orthopedic surgery to correct some aspects of his gait, he had to make significant changes to his walk, and work on daily stretches, most of which require assistance. He is (and was) able to walk on his own, although now does so with a cane. He travels quite a bit for his job and works long hours, so it is difficult for us to work on this on a regular schedule. He can't take a leave of absence form his job, or even temporarily resign, to work on physical therapy full-time, because he absolutely needs his health insurance and he is afraid of jeopardizing that. (Some insurance plans even make cerebral palsy a ``pre-existing condition''.) My health insurance won't cover him, of course, and until recently, I wouldn't have been able to take sick leave to stay with him in the hospital and at home. He was bedridden for a total of two weeks after the surgery. As it was, I hurried back and forth between work and home, because I had just begun a new job, and didn't want to make a bad impression there; but he had scheduled the surgery for around Christmas, so there were many people off on vacation time during that period. The issue of domestic partnership benefits--whether equity in providing health insurance, or even just uniform treatment in granting sick/caregiving and bereavement leave--is important to us as a result. Pam Herman-Milmoe: I am a federal employee and Sara has just finished her Masters Degree in Clinical Psychology. While she was in school she had access to limited benefits, but now that she is job hunting she is completely uninsured. She is working in a paid internship position that is providing great experience and a real service to the community, but no benefits. As she moves on in her career she would like to establish her own practice, but if she does she'll have to pay for her own benefits without any support. The practice of denying benefits to domestic partners puts us at a severe economic disadvantage compared with my coworkers. They can use the money their spouses save on benefits for investments and other purposes. Sara and I plan on having children, who will be covered by my benefits, but money that would support their education and upbringing will have to go to pay for benefits for Sara. Steve Crutchfield: A year ago, my partner of 22 years was fired from his job. When he lost his job, he lost his health insurance benefits. He was able to maintain benefit through a COBRA plan, but it cost us an additional $150 per month to maintain his health benefits. Now that his COBRA benefits are expiring, he has to buy individual medical insurance at a cost of over $300 month. If we had a domestic partner benefits law in place, I could have put him under my insurance benefits as the spouse of a Federal Government Worker. However, since our relationship is not recognized as a marriage, I am unable to enjoy the medical insurance benefits accorded to my colleagues who are in traditional marriages. David Perkins: My partner of fifteen years came with me to Champaign-Urbana, Illinois in order that I might take a job. We have been here over three years and he has not been able to find anything other than part-time work that offers no benefits. Because the state or the University does not extend benefits to same-sex partners, he is without any health benefits whatsoever--and as he will soon turn forty-five years old, health insurance is too expensive for us to pay out-of-pocket. If anything, should happen to him--it will either completely wipe me out financially, or he will be thrown on the mercy of the taxpayers as an indigent case. Not a dramatic story, true--but a fear we live with daily. Anonymous: My partner and I have 3 children ages 15, 13 and 3. I gave birth to the first 2 before getting together with her. The youngest one we had together. Shortly after the arrival of our youngest, the opportunity arrived that I could stay home and care for her instead of putting her in day care. But in quitting my job I also had to give up my health care benefits. My partner's company does not offer domestic benefits so I am not covered for my asthma medication that I need to breath. I also am a high risk for breast cancer due to family history (mother, grandmother and 3 sisters) but I agreed to stay home for the benefit of all our children. Anon: My (same-sex) partner moved in with me in Pennsylvania two years ago. She had been self-employed (a clinical psychologist with a private practice) in CO. We are/ have been in a long-term committed relationship for three years. She had been paying her own health insurance, but since she gave up her income to move here, she had no way of continuing to pay it. My employer (a college) has a subsidized health insurance benefit for married couples only; if we had been married, the additional coverage would have cost $60. Instead, I had to pay $175 monthly so that she would have less adequate health insurance than I have. Since she needed surgery within months of moving here, with a long recovery period, she also could not earn money to help with expenses. We had to spend money on a lawyer to get documents assuring the hospital that I (an ``unrelated'' person) could make decisions for her were she to be incapacitated, etc. Furthermore, she could not avail herself of the physical recreational facilities at the college since she was not a bona fide spouse. I had to pay a membership fee for her to join a ``Y'' so she could use the physical exercise equipment she needed to recover from her surgery. All in all, not having our partnership recognized has cost me a bundle. Mindy Kurzer: My partner Linda and I have been in a committed relationship for 7 years and have a 2 year old daughter named Della. I was very pleased when the University of Minnesota instituted a domestic partner policy about 3 years ago. This policy has helped our family, because Linda is self-employed and previously carried only catastrophic coverage with lots of exclusions for pre-existing conditions. Since the U of M started this policy, we have been able to purchase a very comprehensive medical policy for her. This has turned out to be extremely important, because she was in a car accident 2 years ago, and sustained serious injuries for which she underwent two surgeries and still requires medical treatment. With her current health insurance, we have been able to get her excellent care--without it, I doubt we would have been able to do so. Domestic partner benefits are important to our community, but I think they are also important to the broader society. I have had numerous opportunities to leave the University of Minnesota and have chosen to stay here in part because the University has shown a commitment to reducing discrimination. As more and more businesses and Universities institute domestic partner benefits, institutions that do not (including the government) may be disadvantaged when it comes to getting and retaining top-notch employees. Sibley Bacon: I work for Peoplesoft, Inc. who provides domestic partner benefits to same sex couples. My partner, and I have been together for 4 years * * * she is self- employed, so we opted to have her covered through Peoplesoft. This year she developed a 5.5 cm dermoid tumor on one of her ovaries which was causing her a great deal of pain on a daily basis. Our health insurance paid for the surgery and follow up visits. This would have cost us thousands of dollars had we not had the coverage through Peoplesoft. Additionally she's been able to see a physical therapist to address some old gymnastics injuries. Needless to say, I am eternally grateful that my company provides these benefits to its gay and lesbian employees. Domestic partner coverage will certainly be a deciding factor in the future if I ever end up looking for a job outside of Peoplesoft. Toni A.H. McNaron: My partner, and I have been in a committed relationship for almost 20 years (our anniversary is in June). We own a large home in south Mpls., pay lots of property taxes, earn well over $100,000 a year, and are the first people in our neighborhood to shovel our walks in winter. One of our very nice heterosexual neighbors just married his girlfriend and sometimes doesn't shovel until the next day. The moment he and she signed the marriage license, she had his full health coverage and retirement plan benefits from his quite successful legal coverage and retirement plan benefits from his quite successful legal practice. My partner has never had a PENNY of coverage during the 34 years I've worked as a professor at the University of Minnesota. And, even more unfair, if I were killed by a drunk on the freeway on the way home tonight, she would not even get a condolence letter from the University. Instead she would get a check for the ENTIRE amount of my retirement--considerable after 34 years. Furthermore, she would have to pay the federal government approximately $90,000 at tax time because of her ``windfall.'' (How amazing to consider it a windfall to have your beloved partner of 20 years killed.) My neighbor's wife would get a condolence letter from his firm explaining to her her options for collecting his retirement funds. She is smart and would choose to have them delayed until she is older and then to have them parceled out over time so that she would pay next to no taxes on them. Nancy: I am in Texas on internship. Rose, my partner, is back home in Minnesota. Rose has fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndrome and a number of other health problems. She is in the process of leaving her job and applying for disability. Partly because of her health problems, we would like to relocate permanently to Texas. However, it will take several months for her disability claim to be processed so she can get on Medicare. She can continue her insurance coverage under COBRA, but that would only be good in Minnesota, since her coverage is with a local HMO. I can't put her on my insurance due to lack of domestic partner benefits. So we're faced with a number of unattractive options: (1) I could look for a job in Minnesota, even though both of us would rather move south and that move would be good for Rose's health. (2) She could move here and be without insurance coverage for her multiple health problems until she is approved for disability. (3) We could prolong our geographic separation and have the expense of maintaining separate households until she gets on disability, which can be a very long process. I think this is typical of the difficult choices gay and lesbian couples are forced to make without domestic partner benefits. Julie Ford: My name is Julie Ford, I am the Director of News and Public Affairs for a television station in Sarasota, Florida. My partner is Vicky Oslance, who is a surgical technician by trade but who has chosen to work per diem instead of full time in order to maintain our household since my full time job is very demanding and time consuming. Working per diem, she of course has given up health benefits. This is an added expense for us, one that the other married department heads at my workplace do not have to deal with. I an my partner have been together nearly 9 years . . . longer than most of the married people I work with. We maintain a joint checking account, stock portfolio, and own property together. It is totally unfair for me to have to pay an outrageous amount to insure Vicky's health when other married people at my workplace can get inexpensive company health insurance for their spouses. Susan Hagstrom. When I was hired by UC Berkeley five year ago, I was struck by the lack of equal compensation for equal work. What I did not know then was how close to home this inequality would hit. I recall vividly the day Debra, my partner of seven years, suffered an excruciating ruptured disk. I cried as I watched her in so much pain that she could not stand, sit, or work and had to literally crawl to the bathroom. I cried when she refused to get an MRI because we couldn't afford the $1000 procedure or the expensive doctor visits. I cannot fully describe to you how difficult this lack of benefits has been for me and for Debra. Lori Stone: Until recently, my partner had a job that provided a much inferior benefit plan to my own. Because the deductible on her plan was so high, she would often elect not to get treated for illness, preferring just to ``ride it out.'' Of course this was a risky way to go, and it back- fired on us, when she came down with kidney stones, and was eventually hospitalized. The physical trauma plus the debts we have incurred, because I was unable to cover my partner's expenses, have been difficult to surmount. I currently work for an organization that has excellent medical benefits but no provision for me to be able to cover my partner's medical expenses. If I had been able to cover my partner under my plan, I believe we wouldn't be in the unfortunate financial situation that we are today. Thanks so much for taking this bold move. I pray for the day when I won't feel so disenfranchised in my own country.",

    "text": "Mr. President, first of all, I thank the majority leader for giving me an opportunity to participate more fully in this legislative process and for his profound concern for the people of Colorado. The majority leader has been especially sensitive to this tragedy as it affected the students, parents, teachers, administrators and the support staff at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. I appreciate his willingness, along with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to work with me on possible solutions in the youth violence bill. There will be proposals to try and prevent future tragedies of this nature in our Nation's schools. There will be those who will try and take advantage of this tragedy for their own personal gain. Sadly, in some cases, some people have already sought to gain from this horror.There will be those who will want to completely ignore the problem believing that it will go away on its own. There will be those who share the views of many editorial writers in Colorado that this is a very complicated issue and that no simple solutions are going to be forth coming. These writers echo my views that only a comprehensive examination of all the contributing factors will yield smart, effective policy.The natural reaction is to seek simple solutions by laying blame. Was it inadequate laws? Inadequate enforcement? Do we blame parents, teachers, students themselves, administrators, politicians, organizations, the entertainment industry, churches, or the whole of society? Do we blame the Constitution of the United States?We need to put all this finger pointing aside and realize that we didn't come to this point overnight, that no one-thing is culpable, and that finding sensible solutions will take some time. Now is the time to concentrate and focus on what can be done about the emerging violence we are seeing in our schools. This is the time for us to look for responsible solutions. Now is the time to try and come up with common sense solutions that will make schools more safe.The Constitution of the United States is one of civilization's greatest documents. It has served magnificently as the basic governor of this nation, the world's greatest nation, as it has developed and thrived for over 200 years. The Constitution continues to serve us well and will serve us well as we go through dramatic change in the future.It is the bedrock and the foundation that moves us through national crises while preserving individual freedom. It empowers and checks the government in thoughtful, humble, and timeless language. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly examine the Bill of Rights in the context of today's world and in light of the recent shootings in our schools.During the most recent violent school crisis in Colorado and previously in Oregon, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Mississippi, we are suffered the sense of loss, pain, anger, and frustration from each event. We collectively witnessed the anguish of students, teachers, parents, administrators, and law enforcement through an intense and at time intrusive news media invasion. The wide and dramatic coverage of these events often inspires copycat crimes. But we do not throw out the first amendment.We have seen what happens in societies where there is no freedom of the press. We have witnessed the danger of censorship and government control of the media most recently in Iraq and Yugoslavia; ruthless dictators shut off the free flow of information to strengthen their grip on people who don't enjoy the benefits of a free press! Yes, some who report the news can be insensitive, irritating and down-right rude, but the alternative is far worse. Most news reporting is responsible.It seems as though we re flooded in today's world with acts of violence from guns, knives, and bombs. Anger wells-up inside us as we read and witness such senseless acts of violence, especially in our schools which are supposed to be safe havens for learning. There are many responsible, law-abiding Americans who own and use firearms today.We have witnessed many cases where ruthless dictators have moved early in their reign to disarm their soon-to-be victims. Yes, of the 270 million people in this country there are a few who are a menace to society with the guns that they own, but we cannot forget the many responsible gun owners in the United States. Guns have sporting uses, but they also save lives. Let us not forget that guns have been used to protect people, and they will continue to do so in the future.The third amendment to the Constitution talks about the excesses of the military in terms of the home. It recognizes the right of the citizen to have his own home and to have it as his sanctuary free from any soldier claiming a greater right than the citizen. In times of civil crisis we occasionally see the military used to ensure safety.Most soldiers are dedicated and trustworthy servants of this country and it is only on the rare occasion that one is not. Throughout these crises in our schools we have seen a highly charged and emotional police force move to secure the area and conduct an investigation. People are calling for quick action, looking for people to blame, and being critical of every move. The fourth amendment protects students, teachers, administrators, and parents from unfounded accusations and unwarranted seizures. It protects them from the crafty criminal who may want to shift the focus and action to an innocent party. One does not have to look far to see that people in parts of Central America, Iraq, and Yugoslavia do not have this right. During these times of crisis in our schools, people in and around these institutions are protected by due process of law.They cannot be deprived of their life, liberty, and property without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation. Some Americans want to disregard these provisions in a time of crisis. There are those who demand immediate resolution regardless of cost, but here we see the grandeur of the fifth amendment as it protects people from whims and the heat of a crisis.In any time of urgent need or catastrophe, the innocent may fall victim to false accusations. This is particularly obvious when elected officials are trying to show the electorate that they can produce results. We have seen the innocent accused and then exonerated by the justice system in cases of violence in our schools, and for this we owe the sixth amendment to our Constitution.During these troubling times in our schools there are claims of injury placed against those who have had a public responsibility. The vast majority of our public servants are good decent Americans who work to serve other people. There are a few, for one reason or another, who fail to carry out their responsibilities. The method for redress in these sad circumstances is provided in the seventh amendment.In responding to the horrific events in our schools the justice system is required to balance bail and punishment with the crime committed. The eighth amendment provides for this process to be fair and judicious.And what of rights not clearly enumerated in the Constitution? The ninth amendment expressly states that as sweeping and dedicated to liberty as the document is, it cannot provide for all freedoms. The ninth amendment allows for the protection of rights not clearly defined by the Constitution indicating a wisdom that we embrace as we approach any crisis.The 10th amendment prevents the Federal Government in times of crisis from ignoring the role of the States. Our forefathers feared most of all not the military but a national police force. The individual states were given the basic responsibilities of law enforcement, and in times of school crisis we have witnessed the effectiveness of this provision. We have also witnessed through our history many nations terrorized by a national police force. In these cases isn't an armed citizenry capable of defending itself the preferred but not perfect solution?My purpose for reviewing these vital amendments to our Constitution, this grand Bill of Rights, is to illustrate that in times of crisis, these rights are the layers of a foundation of liberty on which we live. This bedrock is the sacred strength of our nation. It is the bedrock that supports our churches, our homes, our businesses, and our schools. A natural tendency in times of crisis is to drive wedges into this bedrock in search of a solution. It is my hope that we conduct this debate upon the bedrock, and not within it.I hope during this debate we keep in mind that we do not have the power to eliminate all violence in all schools. We must strive to restore a safe environment for learning within the bounds of individual freedom. A few must not be allowed to destroy that which the American people have prospered and come to appreciate over several centuries. Common sense and sensitivity must prevail.In that light I believe there are things we can do to address school violence. There are no simple solutions and it will not happen overnight but I believe we can begin to move down that road by improving the safety in our schools. Even though schools will be our focus, the problems we face go far beyond the walls of any school, any community, any state, or for that matter any country. The laws we pass will have far reaching effects on numerous aspects of our society. I look forward to proceeding through this legislative agenda in a thoughtful manner, mindful of our sacred responsibility to the bedrock of our nation--the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.I was recently given the honor and privilege of chairing a task force on Youth Violence. This task force, composed of twelve Senators, has thoughtfully deliberated over the problem of youth violence for the past two weeks. Our efforts are, in part, a response to the recent tragedies seen in our nation's schools. We support S. 254, the Juvenile Justice bill, and the efforts of Chairman Hatch and his committee who have labored for the past several years to draft careful reforms that will positively impact our juvenile justice system. In addition, we have come to a consensus on several themes which affect juvenile crime, education and our culture. This package of legislative proposals applies reasonable reforms which we hope will enhance the work of Senator Hatch and his committee.The consensus of themes our task force will be working toward this week are:Stengthening prevention and enforcement assistance to State and local government. This is the first step in a plan which infuses funds to State and local authorities to combat juvenile crime. The Federal government will assist states best by providing flexible block grants. Our plan includes juvenile crime grants; improving our management of juvenile crime records; targeted prevention funding; a plan for graduated sanctions which begin early--when the first signs of delinquent or antisocial behavior appear, and alternative education opportunities for at-risk or problem juveniles.Another point is pushing back the influence of cultural violence by empowering parents and encouraging the public to be socially responsible. Our second step is to help our culture do more to limit the exposure of America's children to harmful and violent entertainment. Following the recent tragedy in my state, it seems clear that our culture's fascination with violence played some role in the thoughts and motivations of the cruel perpetrators of the crimes in Littleton. This includes enacting an entertainment industry code of conduct that allows for further development and enforcement of rating systems to limit exposure to children of material that the industry itself has deemed inappropriate for children. We include a plan to investigate the marketing practices of the entertainment industry where children are concerned. This plan also includes empowering Internet service providers to offer screening and filtering software that is designed to empower parents to limit access to material unsuitable for children. Our package also includes a plan to prohibit the posting of bomb making instructions on the Internet.Last, I am offering two amendments which liberate students and faculty to hold memorial services or to construct a memorial on school property in the aftermath of a tragedy.I will conclude my statement today with remarks on these amendments. The final theme of our package reinforces the theme that it is time to get tough on violent juveniles and firearms used by criminals. The Republican plan makes it more difficult for a juvenile to gain access to a firearm and insures that violent juveniles--teenagers who commit violent crimes--will be held accountable for their actions. We do this by ensuring the prosecution of those who abuse existing firearms laws. This means directing the Department of Justice to make firearms prosecutions a priority--something they have not been so far. We address gun show safety and firearms background checks, juvenile firearms possession, and penalties for firearms offenses across the board. We increase the penalty for theft of a firearm and we increase the mandatory minimum sentences for those who corrupt youth by selling them or encouraging them to sell drugs.We also address safe and secure schools. Republicans want all children to receive a quality education. This experience should be a safe one. We propose numerous options for schools to use federal funds for better teacher training regarding violent students and school security. We provide for mandatory school discipline records disclosure for transferring students; we allow for all schools the opportunity to institute address code or school uniform policy; and we free up teachers and school administrators to adequately discipline students while at the same time giving them limited liability protection. Our bill establishes a national center to boost school security efforts and creates a national award for children with character.In proposing this package, we do not pretend to believe our legislative actions will erase the harm already inflicted on too many Americans. Nor do we believe these laws will guard against all future threats of youth violence. But I do believe that the Congress has an opportunity today to strengthen and enhance our existing laws to empower families and communities to take action against this cultural virus seen in our youth.Our responsibility is to apply reason and temperance to the decisions we make this week, holding close the dearly held principles of life and liberty which are expressed in our Bill of Rights. I am hopeful that the Senate will work together to accomplish this objective.I would like to say a few words regarding my proposed amendments that will be before the Senate the first part of this next week. In the aftermath of the Littleton tragedy, I propose these amendments which will allow Congress to go on record with respect to the constitutionality of a permanent memorial or a memorial service that contains religious speech. Of course, the Allard amendments do not put Congress on record with respect to the kind of memorial that would be appropriate--that decision is for local schools and communities. The Allard amendments do, however, declare that a fitting memorial may contain religious speech without violating the Constitution.As you approach Arlington National Cemetery, signs are posted which say:Welcome to Arlington National Cemetery, Our Nation's Most Sacred Shrine. Please Conduct Yourselves with Dignity and Respect at All Times. Please Remember these are Hallowed Grounds.Similarly, Congress appropriates the funds to pay for chaplains who conduct memorial services not only at Arlington Cemetery but wherever they are needed to serve our departed men and women of the Armed Forces and their families. We recognize that paying for chaplains to conduct memorial services is not an establishment of religion by the Government, but a dignified and proper Government function. The Supreme Court has noted that the chaplaincies of the various branches of the service are constitutional. Likewise, no one could seriously contend that the signs identifying Arlington Cemetery as a sacred shrine and hallowed ground are establishments of religion.So today I am offering an amendment which states that it is fitting and proper for a school to hold a memorial service when a student or teacher is killed on school grounds. And it is fitting and proper to include religious references, songs, and readings in such a service. Memorial services help the grieving process of students and faculty, bring a school together in the face of tragedy, and meet a need deeply felt by so many to see their friend given recognition in a dignified and solemn manner. My amendment allows students and faculty of a public school to hold a memorial service that includes prayer, reading of scripture, or the performance of religious music at a memorial service that is held on the campus of a public school in order to honor the memory of any person slain on that campus.As a part of my proposed amendment there is a section that allows for the construction of a memorial that includes religious symbols or reference to God on school property. In either case, if a lawsuit is brought forth, parties are required to pay their own fees and costs and the Attorney General is authorized to provide legal assistance to defenders.This is not the equivalent of a daily school prayer. A memorial service is a very specific response to an unusual circumstance, a circumstance I hope we will not have to revisit again. The amendments specifically mention that religious songs may be sung at such memorials without violating the Constitution. The two federal appeals courts that have taken up this issue both have ruled that school choirs may sing religious music. And the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that it was constitutional for a public high school choir to have ``The Lord Bless You and Keep You'' as its signature song.In the same way, erecting a memorial that contained religious references, such as a quote from scripture, or a religious symbol from the deceased's religious tradition, would not violate the establishment clause of the Constitution.In any community visited by such a tragedy, a person who views such a memorial with religious symbols or references that were important to the deceased would certainly not see some sort of covert attempt to establish an official religion. Rather, they would see a fitting and proper memorial to a departed friend.I urge my colleagues to support my modest proposal. This legislation does two things. It requires that if a school holds memorial services or puts up a memorial in response to a killing on school grounds, and the school is sued, then all parties will bear their own costs and attorneys fees. A school that has experienced a tragedy of this kind should not have to worry about someone bringing a suit and winning thousands and thousands of dollars in attorney fee awards just because the school decides to hold a memorial service or put up a memorial. Second, this legislation permits--but does not require--the Attorney General to aid a school in defending against these suits.This is one small thing we can do to help our schools respond in a humane, compassionate, and constitutional way to the violence that has become far too common in our schools. If the people of Colorado believe that religious speech is necessary to memorialize the heroism and tragedy at Columbine High School, then let them express themselves with the most profound and durable expressions of the human heart. Let us adopt this amendment today, hoping an occasion for its use may never happen again.I yield the floor.",

    "title": "PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 1999",
    "text": "Mr. President, in the 1970s, the State of Colorado adopted a well-child care law, legislation concerning the treatment of alcoholism and mental health, as well as legislation concerning insurance coverage of psychologists. In the 1980s home health care, hospice care, and mammography screening legislation was passed into law. In the 1990s, those who represent the people of Colorado in the State House saw fit to pass laws concerning the coverage of nurses, nurse midwives, nurse anesthetists, nurse practitioners, psychiatric nurses, the continuation of coverage for dependents and employees, and conversion to non-group health care.This decade the Colorado Legislature also passed consumer grievance procedures, children's dental anesthesia and general dental provisions, direct access to OB-GYN, direct access to midwives for OB-GYN, emergency room services legislation, a ban on gag clauses, prostate cancer screening, breast reconstruction, maternity stay, and mental health parity legislation. Last, but certainly not least, among State laws enacted in my home State is a law concerning independent external appeals for patients and a comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights, passed in I am proud to have served in the Colorado State Senate, and I am proud to say that today I represent a state that has been responsive and aggressive in addressing health care issues and patients' rights.At the same time, Mr. President, I am deeply troubled that there are those in this body who are advocates of Senator Kennedy's Patients' Bill of Rights that would preempt a number of the laws that I just mentioned in the State of Colorado. In this country of 260 million Americans throughout the fifty states I believe that the people of those States are in the best position to make these specific decisions. I come from our nation's 8th largest State with a population of just 3.9 million people. I will not assume that any federal entity is more prepared to develop policy for Colorado than the people of Colorado, nor would I impose the policies unique to Colorado's needs on another State.Something I find equally troubling is that in addition to infringing on the laws of the State of Colorado, the legislation that Senator Kennedy and the Democrats have developed has the potential to increase health care costs, deprive 1.9 million Americans of health insurance who are currently covered, and cast heavy mandates down on individual states who are in a far better position to make these decisions for themselves.I will speak today about a number of things I believe will enhance the quality of health care, increase access to care, and provide important protections for patients without unnecessarily placing mandates on individual states. These provisions are all part of a comprehensive package called the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, which I feel properly addresses the needs of America's patients, physicians and health care providers.The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act establishes consumer protection standards for self-funded plans currently governed by the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act (ERISA). 48 million Americans are currently covered by plans governed by ERISA--these are American health care consumers who are not under the jurisdiction of state laws.Our bill would eliminate gag rule clauses in providers' contracts and ensure that patients have access to specialty care. The legislation also requires that health plans that use formularies to provide prescription medications ensure the participation of doctors and pharmacists in the construction of the formulary. Further addressing patient choice and access, health plans would be required to allow women direct access to obstetricians and gynecologists, and direct access to pediatricians for children, without referrals from general practitioners.These provisions are important steps in removing barriers that may prevent patients covered under ERISA from receiving necessary and proper treatment in a timely manner.As a former small business owner I have a keen understanding of the issues that confront the self-employed. I also have experience in balancing the wages and benefits you extend to an employee with a healthy bottom line. I think it is important that we remember throughout the course of this debate that employers provide health care benefits as a voluntary form of compensation for their employees. We must be wary of legislation that will increase costs and liability for employers in a way that may reduce the quality and scope of benefit packages for employees.Our bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, would make health insurance deductible for the self-employed and increase the availability of medical savings accounts. I believe that each of these provisions would give greater power to the individual and make private insurance more affordable for families and individuals. Large corporations can claim a 100 percent deduction for health care and small business should be treated the same.Medical savings accounts, otherwise known as MSAs, combine a high deductible and low cost catastrophic policy with tax free savings that can be used for routine medical expenses. We should increase the availability to all families who desire MSAs. These efforts will prove particularly helpful to those individuals working for small business, and those in transition from one job to another since MSAs are fully portable.I want to stress that our legislation will not mandate these accounts for everyone, but will simply establish the accounts as an option to those who feel they will be best served by MSAs. I believe that medical savings accounts are particularly important for uninsured, lower income Americans. Allowing consumers to pay for medical expenses through these affordable tax-deductible plans, tailored to their needs, is a viable free-market approach to decreasing the number of uninsured in America. This is a question of providing greater choice for health care consumers.The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act would also permit the carryover of unused benefits from flexible spending accounts, again increasing the number of options available to the consumers of health care.In keeping with presenting more options to the consumer, The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act includes language that would require all group health plans to provide a wide range of comparative information about the health coverage they provide. This information would include descriptions of health insurance coverage and the networks who provide care so that consumers covered by self insured and fully insured group health plans can make the best decisions based on their needs and preferences.One of the most contentious issues in health care has been the issue of malpractice liability, grievance procedures and the mechanism for the appeal of decisions made by managed care companies. My colleagues across the aisle are interested in taking the grievance procedure into a court of law, allowing a patient greater access to litigation as a means of challenging a managed care organization's decision.Lawsuits and the increased threat of litigation will demand that more money to be funneled into non-medical administration and away from what patients really want--quality health care. Furthermore, making the courts a de facto arbiter of health care decisions seems to me to be less efficient and less effective in dealing with the interests of the patient. The Kennedy bill is an enormous gift for the trial lawyers in America who stand to profit by high cost, long-term cases. Patients, not lawyers, will fare far better under the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus.I am also concerned that expanding medical malpractice liability will lead to more defensive medical decisions regardless of the merit of a particular treatment. High liability exposure and cost has driven countless physicians from their profession for years, particularly in high-need rural areas.This is not a provision we can afford in rural areas of western States like Colorado that are already under-served.Rather than take health care out of the doctor's office and into the courts, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act establishes strict time frames for internal and external appeals for the 124 million Americans who receive care from self insured and fully insured group plans. Routine requests would need to be completed within 30 days, or 72 hours in specific cases when a delay would be detrimental to the patient. Rather than use the courts in cases of health care appeals our legislation would establish a system of independent, internal and external review by physicians with appropriate expertise. We are talking about doctors with years of experience and medical training making health care decisions, not legal arguments.I believe that such a system will be more responsive and more tailored to the needs of every individual patient--and it will do so without creating unnecessary bureaucracy. It is also important to note that these internal and external appeals will cost patients and employers considerably less than the alternative proposal that is heavy on lawsuits, lawyers and litigation.Another area of concern that I believe needs to be incorporated in any sensible managed care reform legislation is the inclusion of protections for patients from genetic discrimination. The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act would prohibit all group health plans and insurers from denying coverage or adjusting premiums based on predictive genetic information. The protected genetic information includes an individual's genetic tests, genetic tests of family members, or information about the medical history of family members.No one should live in fear of being without health care based on genetic traits that may not develop into a health problem.Mr. President, I believe these provisions will empower the individual, not the lawyers or bureaucracies. I am committed to the notion that each individual American consumer of health care is in the best position to chose where his or her health care dollar is best spent.An administrative issue involved in this debate that I am very concerned with is the effort to attempt to force all health plans--not just HMOs--to report the medical outcomes of their subscribers and the physicians who treat them. This makes sense for a managed care plan such as an HMO, but it would be virtually impossible for a PPO or indemnity plan to monitor and classify this data without becoming involved in individual medical cases.I believe that if we require all health plans to collect and report data like this we will be requiring all plans to be organized like an HMO. This would significantly reduce the number of choices consumers and employers currently enjoy in selecting their health care.The Congressional Budget Office recently determined that if S. 6, the Kennedy version of the Patients' Bill of Rights, were to pass that this country would see private health insurance premiums increase 6.1 percent above inflation. What appears to be a minor increase to health care premiums would have disastrous and immediate consequences around the country, adding 1.9 million Americans to the ranks of the uninsured. In my home state that translates to 32,384 people. In Colorado the average household would lose $203 in wages and 2,989 jobs would be lost by 2003 for this ``minor'' increase.We are talking about people in Colorado losing their jobs and their health care coverage because Washington wants to do what the State of Colorado has been working on for the last thirty years.The Congressional Budget Office determined that our bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, would increase costs by less than 1 percent. While I urge my colleagues to be wary of any potential increase in costs for the American people, I also believe that the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, and not the current Kennedy bill, directly addresses health care quality issues and increases choice for consumers with a minimal cost.",

By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Crapo):S. 3213. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow an individual to designate $3 or more on their income tax return to be used to reduce the public debt; to the Committee on Finance.Mr. President, I have introduced S. 3213. I want to take a few moments to talk about this important piece of legislation for paying down the national debt.As the 106th Congress comes to an end, I rise to make a few comments on the evolution of an issue of great concern to myself and to many Americans. The issue is the $5,661,548,045,674 national debt we had as of October 2, 2000.In August of 1993, while serving in the House of Representatives, I introduced House Joint Resolution 251 with the support of a number of my colleagues. The intention of this resolution was to amend the Constitution of the United States to provide for budgetary reform by requiring the reduction of the deficit, a balanced Federal budget, and the repayment of the national debt. During my years in the House, I had the good fortune to work with many Republican colleagues who were committed to these fiscally sound and enormously important issues.Today, a scant 7 years later, we are enjoying unsurpassed Federal budget surpluses and the many difficulties that accompany such prosperity. I am concerned that the running dialog in Washington is far too focused on today's spending, today's enormous Federal programs, today's immediate wants and needs. I am concerned that we are talking too much about spend today and not enough about the consequences of tomorrow. As we conclude the appropriations process, it is apparent that many Members of this body are eager to transform the Federal budget surplus into new Federal spending, creating more Federal programs that will begat future obligations.I am primarily concerned that efforts to recklessly spend every nickel of the taxpayers' money will threaten the long-term fiscal health of our Nation, the Nation our children and grandchildren will inherit. The majority of my colleagues on this side of the aisle are focusing on returning the surplus to its rightful owners--the American people.In recent months, the current administration has taken a hardline against tax cuts, making it clear that the President believes the Federal budget surplus belongs to Washington and not the hard-working men and women who send far more money to the Internal Revenue Service than they often save for retirement, college, or for buying a home.I find it frustrating and the height of arrogance to assume that the Federal Government can do more with this money than the taxpayers. So many of my Republican colleagues have such a profound conviction regarding returning the money to the working man and woman that, in fact, they have been hesitant to engage in development of a comprehensive long-term debt repayment plan.I have come to the floor before, and I will come to the floor again, to make clear what is required to manage the national debt in a comprehensive repayment strategy. The sheer enormity of the national debt demands such diligence. I admit that I have no desire to increase the growth of the Federal Government instead of paying down the debt. I am, as many of my colleagues, however, personally committed to cutting taxes.I have come to the floor today for no other reason than to make one thing crystal clear: We can pay down the debt and cut taxes. It is not an either/or proposition. It takes planning, and it takes commitment. It takes a plan to repay the debt and a commitment to cut taxes and the discipline to refrain from pouring ever more money into newer or larger programs.At the end of fiscal year 1999, the gross Federal budget was $5,656,270,901,615 and at the end of fiscal year 2000, the gross Federal budget was $5,674,178,209,886.Our past fiscal irresponsibilities have created this overwhelming mess, and an unpleasant task lies before us. For the health and well-being of our national economy and the future security of our young people, we must commit to the elimination of this debt.The journey of 5\\1/2\\ trillion miles begins with a single step. Early in the 106th Congress, I introduced the American Debt Repayment Act. A year later, I followed that legislation with the American Social Security Protection and Debt Repayment Act. I believe each of these bills provided a sensible first step toward debt repayment and the 5 trillion steps to follow.Both pieces of legislation suggested we treat the Federal debt just as every American treats the largest purchase they will ever make. That is their home. In February of this year, I came to the floor with my friends, George Voinovich, Rod Grams and Mike Enzi, with an amortization schedule for debt repayment to be offered to the budget resolution. Just as any American home buyer would amortize the purchase of their home with a mortgage, we offered a dutiful and moderate restriction on Federal spending combined with a specific debt repayment schedule. Our amendment was defeated. I believe the chief reason for the defeat of the amendment was the fear of being locked into a long-term repayment plan that would prohibit future tax cuts. The July 2000 budget economic and outlook update by the Congressional Budget Office disputes this understandable fear.According to the CBO, assuming spending is frozen at fiscal year 2000 levels, the next 10 years will yield an on-budget surplus of $3.4 trillion. If this Congress had exercised some discipline this year and appropriated within a freeze, the on-budget surplus in fiscal year 2001, which we have just begun, is projected to be $116 billion.One criticism of the long-term debt amortization plan that I brought to the floor was that it would prevent tax cuts and tie the hands of appropriators by absorbing all of the surplus. My most recent plan simply dedicates $15 billion of on-budget surplus to debt repayment and adds $15 billion each year thereafter. The sum total after 10 years of structured debt repayment is $825 billion from on-budget surplus.This repayment schedule would have left $2.6 trillion remaining for tax cuts and new spending over the next 10 years.It is important to note that these numbers do not take into account the off-budget surplus created by Social Security. I have said on the floor many times before that paying down the national debt is one of the best ways to provide long-term fiscal stability to Social Security.In the past, I proposed restricted use of the Social Security surplus to help pay down the debt. This not only provides for the future stability of Social Security by paying down the debt but protects Social Security money from Federal discretionary spending.Social Security surplus money should be used for debt repayment only until such time as Congress can initiate sensible reform to preserve the long-term integrity of Social Security. Social Security reform has been a priority of this Congress, and we can act to reduce the debt and reform this important program in one commitment.When the new Congress convenes in 2001, I intend to continue to work with my colleagues on developing a sensible and concrete debt repayment plan. I am also interested in working with my colleagues on other innovative ways to reduce the national debt. Legislation was recently introduced in the House, and I am pleased to come to the floor today on behalf of myself and the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Crapo, to introduce the Taxpayers Choice Debt Reduction Act.Every year, millions of taxpaying Americans have the opportunity to designate on their tax form a $3 contribution to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund. This checkoff on all 1040 forms would allow for the taxpayers themselves to designate that $3, or $6 for joint filers, would be dedicated to a special Department of the Treasury account to pay down the national debt.Checking the box on the tax document would not increase the amount of taxes to be paid, nor would it decrease any refund. Checking ``yes'' in this box would simply provide a directive from the taxpayer that 3 of the dollars they were paying in taxes be used solely to pay down the Nation's debt. Importantly, these funds would be beyond any money set aside by Congress for debt reduction.In my annual town meetings around the State of Colorado, I often speak with my constituents over the enormous debt owed by this country. I can say with great confidence that this is an issue where the public desires action. It is my hope that with this legislation Congress will empower these concerned taxpayers to act on their impulse to eliminate the debt. Mr. GREGG (for himself and Mr. Harkin):S. 3214. A bill to amend the Assets for Independence Act (Title IV of the Community Opportunities, Accountability, and Training and Educational Services Act of 1998) to enhance program flexibility, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.Mr. President, in his 1991 book ``Assets and the Poor: a New American Welfare Policy,'' Washington University Professor Michael Sherraden argues that people move forward economically through savings and investment, not through spending and consumption. Owning assets gives people a stake in the future--a reason to save, to dream, and to invest time, effort and resources in creating a future for themselves and their children. As Sherraden puts it, ``income may feed people's stomachs, but assets change their heads.''I am pleased today to be joined by Senator Harkin in introducing legislation designed to further promote innovative asset-building strategies for the poor.Over the past two years, asset-building strategies have gained widespread, bi-partisan support at both the federal and state levels. Legislation has been introduced and laws have been enacted to develop and promote Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) among low income Americans. IDAs reward the monthly savings of working poor families who are trying to buy their first home, pay for post secondary education, or start a business.In some respects, IDAs are like Individual Retirement Accounts for the working poor. IDAs are dedicated savings accounts that can be used for purchasing a first home, paying for post-secondary education, or capitalizing business. These investments are associated with extremely high rates of return that have the potential to bring a new level of economic and personal security to families and communities. Participants also are able to make emergency withdrawals in limited circumstances and must pay back such withdrawals within 12 months.The individual or family deposits whatever dollar amount they can save (typically $5 to $20 a month) into the account. The sponsoring organization matches that deposit with funds provided by local churches and service organizations, corporations, foundations, and state or local governments. The sponsoring organization determines the ratio at which they will match an individual's contribution (not less than $0.50 and not more than $4 for every $1).In 1998, Congress enacted legislation entitled the ``Assets for Independence Act''. This Act established a five year demonstration program to determine the social, civic, psychological and economic effects that individual development account, IDA, savings accounts can have on low income individuals and their families. The assets for independence demonstration program is presently the largest source of federal funding for individual development accounts.The intent of this demonstration program is to encourage participants to develop and reinforce strong habits for saving money. To assist this, sponsor organizations provide participating individuals and families intensive financial counseling and counseling to develop investment plans for education, home ownership, and entrepreneurship. In addition, participating welfare and low-income families build assets whose high return on investment has the capacity for propelling them into independence and stability. The community also benefits from the significant return on investment in IDAs: we expect welfare rolls to be reduced, tax receipts to increase, employment to increase, and local enterprises and builders can expect local businesses to benefit from increased activity. Neighborhoods will be rejuvenated as new micro-enterprises and increased home renovation and building drive increased employment and community development.In fact, it is estimated that an investment of $125 million in assert building through these individual accounts will generate 7,050 new businesses, 68,799 new jobs, $730 million in additional earnings, 12,000 new or rehabilitated homes, $287 million in savings and matching contributions and earnings on those accounts, $188 million in increased assets for low-income families, 6,600 families removed from welfare rolls, 12,000 youth graduates from vocational education and college programs, 20,000 adults obtaining high school, vocational, and college degrees.IDA programs currently exist in about 250-300 communities, with another 100 in development. Overall, at least 10,000 people are currently saving in an IDA and another 30,000-40,000 are expected to be reached by the year 2003. All but three states have IDA programs in their states or mechanisms in place to permit the start up of an IDA program.The field of economic development has rapidly changed over the course of the last few years, and as a result, those administering IDAs on a national basis have sought to work within the structure defined by Congress. Unfortunately, because of changes in the field and certain unforeseen difficulties with the implementation of the demonstration in its current form, we have been asked to consider making a handful of technical changes that will help with program administration and make the program run more consistently and effectively.Those changes include: (1) changing the legal accounting structure of IDAs; (2) expanding the potential field of grantees to include low-income credit unions and community development financial institutions; (3) providing additional flexibility for withdrawals from IDA accounts for the purchase of a home; (4) expanding the availability of funds for economic literacy training; and (5) adding a Federal poverty measure to the current eligibility criteria; and (6) making the AFIA and TANF Individual Development Account programs consistent with respect to the treatment of funds for purposes of determining eligibility for Federal programs based on need.These are modest but needed changes in the law that will help Federal IDA programs function more as originally intended. I urge their adoption.I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Assets for Independence Act Amendments of 2000--Section-by-Section NOTE: Except where otherwise specified, references in this summary to provisions of law are references to provisions of the Assets for Independence Act (the Act), title IV of the Community Opportunities, Accountability, and Training and Educational Services Act of 1998.This section amends section 404(5)(A) (which defines the term ``Individual Development Account'' (IDA) and specifies required IDA elements), in clause (v), to eliminate language which permits use of matching contributions by the qualified entity serving as IDA trustee for emergency withdrawals. As amended, clause (v) would permit use of matching contributions only for qualified expenses (as defined in section 404(8)). The amendment would eliminate the inconsistency between section 404(5)(A)(v) as currently drafted and section 404(3), which defines the term ``emergency withdrawal'' to mean a withdrawal by the eligible individual of some or all of the funds deposited by that individual for specified emergency situations.This section amends section 404(7) (the definition of ``qualified entity'') to expand the category of entities eligible to operate IDA programs under the Act to include low-income credit unions (as designated by the National Credit Union Administration) and organizations designated as community development financial institutions by the Secretary of the Treasury (or the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund) that can demonstrate a collaborative relationship with a community-based organization.Section 4(a) amends section 407(8)(B) (which includes the purchase of a first home in the definition of ``qualified expenses'' for which IDA funds can be withdrawn by the participant) to increase the purchase price limit to 120 percent of the average area purchase price for such a residence.Section 5 amends section 407(c)(3) by increasing from 9.5 percent of 15 percent the amount of funds that grantee organizations may use to provide economic literacy training and other administrative functions. Of this amount, not more than 7.5 percent may be used for administrative functions.This section amends section 408(a) (which sets forth IDA participation criteria) by adding an additional criteria for eligibility as an IDA program participant. Under this amendment, an individual with an income less than 200% of the poverty line (as defined by OMB), would be eligible to participate.Section 7 amends Section 412 &lt;Copyright&gt; which currently requires the first Annual Progress Report to be delivered not later than 60 days after the end of the calendar year. This amendment would require the first report to be delivered not later than 60 days after the end of the project year.This section amends section 414(d) which currently requires the first interim evaluation to be delivered not later than 90 days after the end of the calendar year in which the Secretary first authorizes a demonstration project. This amendment would require the first interim evaluation to be delivered not later than 90 days after the end of the project year.The section amends section 414(e) (which sets forth the amount the Secretary may set aside to evaluate the IDA program) by changing from 2% to not more than $500,000 the amount of IDA appropriations set aside for such evaluation. By Mr. HARKIN:S. 3215. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize women's health research award programs conducted through the National Institutes of Health; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Women's Health Research Career Enhancement Act of 2000. This legislation addresses a critical shortage of qualified clinician researchers available to investigate the diseases and conditions that primarily affect women.As the brother of two sisters lost to breast cancer and the father of two daughters, I know first-hand the importance of making women's health initiatives a top priority. More can and must be done to guarantee that women have the quality care they deserve. This includes making sure that qualified researchers are out there leading the search for cures and treatments.In 1985, the United States Public Health Task Force on Women's Health Issues concluded that women's health care was getting short shrift by the lack of research focus on women's health concerns. Since then we have made good progress to expand women's health research, but more needs to be done.In 1990, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) found that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) had been slow and ineffective in implementing a policy to include women in research study populations. At the urging of myself and others, and in response to passage of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993, the NIH began to take more comprehensive measures to increase research on health problems affecting women. And more recently, at my request, along with Senators Olympia Snowe and Barbara Mikulski, and Representative Harry Waxman (D-CA), the GAO published a report last May assessing the NIH's progress on conducting research on women's health in the past decade. The GAO's report found that while NIH has made significant progress in implementing a strengthened policy on including women in clinical research, they have failed to fully analyze clinical data on women's health.It is clear we can and must do more to advance a comprehensive women's health agenda.A growing body of evidence is emerging that demonstrates significant differences between men and women and how they get sick and how they react to potential treatments. Women and men metabolize food, alcohol, medication and environmental toxins differently.And certain diseases and conditions disproportionately affect women. For example, women comprise 80% of those suffering from osteoporosis. Seventy-five percent of those afflicted with autoimmune diseases are women. And although we have made significant progress, we are still fighting the terrible epidemic of breast cancer in this country, a disease that strikes 1 out of every 8 American women.Women everywhere will benefit through more and better scientific research on the diseases and conditions that affect them. And our scientific enterprise will reap maximum returns when it involves teams of investigators with expertise in various disciplines. A comprehensive, targeted approach is necessary to develop a multi-disciplinary cadre of researchers with the interest and expertise to broaden the field of women's health research.In addition, mentoring between junior and senior scientists is important to promoting an inclusive and diverse research environment. Mentoring relationships can lead to the retention and advancement of talented scientists from all segments of the population and enhance our investment in medical research.Mr. President, my legislation authorizes two important initiatives to expand the number of qualified investigators in women's health research by providing improved career development opportunities through the National Institutes of Health (NIH):First, the Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health Program--will support the career development of junior women's health scientists by providing new opportunities to improve their research skills in interdisciplinary settings. The NIH, through the Office of Research on Women's Health, will provide grants to research institutions to pair junior investigators with seasoned senior investigators, who will mentor them for 2-5 years.Second, the Women's Reproductive Health Research Career Development Centers--will help build the next generation of investigators in obstetrics and gynecology by giving clinicians the experience they need to become women's health scientists. The NIH, through the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Office of Research on Women's Health, will provide grants to research institutions and hospitals for the training of new women's health researchers.The Women's Reproductive Health Research Career Development Centers program and the Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health grant program have already stimulated women's health research across a variety of disciplines. Authorizing and expanding these programs will speed breakthroughs in women's health research by building and improving the network of scientific investigators expert in the diseases and conditions that affect women.Mr. President, I have a long tradition of supporting research and specifically women's health research both as Chairman and now Ranking Member of the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee. This year we will provide an unprecedented, $2.7 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health, keeping us well on track towards our goal of doubling the NIH budget over 5 years.But all the funding in the world will do us no good if we don't have talented investigators ready and able to take on the challenge of finding the cures and treatments for the diseases that afflict us. We must do more to make sure we grow and strengthen a diverse network of our best and brightest clinicians and scientists to keep pace with our increased investment in medical research. The bill I am introducing today will help to do just that. It has the support of the National Institutes of Health, the Society for Women's Health Research, the Women's Health Research Coalition and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,This Act may be cited as the ``Women's Health Research Career Enhancement Act of 2000''.Congress makes the following findings: (1) The Public Health Service's Task Force on Women's Health Issues concluded in 1985 that women's health care was compromised by the lack of research focus on women's health concerns. Since then, progress has been made to expand women's health research, but more can be done to strengthen our nation's capacity to aggressively investigate the diseases and conditions primarily affecting women. (2) A growing body of evidence demonstrates dramatic differences between women's and men's biology, including symptoms of disease, mechanism of disease and responses to treatment. (3) Women and men differ in disease presentation and treatment outcomes of coronary heart disease. Women comprise 80 percent of the population suffering from osteoporosis. Women comprise 75 percent of those afflicted with autoimmune diseases. Women and men metablolize food, alcohol, medication, and atmospheric toxins differently. (4) Scientific research will reap maximum returns when it involves teams of investigators with expertise in various disciplines. A comprehensive, targeted effort is necessary to develop a multi-disciplinary cadre of researchers with the interest and expertise to develop the field of gender based health research so that it has the greatest impact on all women and men. (5) Mentoring between junior and senior scientists is vitally important to promoting an inclusive and diverse research environment, leading to the retention and advancement of talented scientists from all segments of the population and enhancing the nation's investment in treatments and cures for the diseases and conditions that affect Americans. (6) The Women's Reproductive Health Research Career Development Centers and the Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health grant programs have stimulated women's health research across a variety of disciplines. (7) Expanding the initiatives described in paragraph (6) will speed breakthroughs in women's health research by building and improving the network of scientific investigators who are experts in the diseases and conditions that affect women.Part A of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:Part A of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``SEC. 310A.

    "text": "Mr. President, today I want to take a few minutes to recognize the efforts of everyone involved in the capture of the Texas fugitives that ended one of the largest manhunts this national has ever seen. As you know, the last two of the seven Texas inmates that escaped from a maximum security prison in Kenedy, Texas on December 13th surrendered on January 24th in Colorado Springs, Colorado. This can be attributed to the exemplary work done by the local and federal law enforcement agencies involved as well as the communities of Woodland Park and Colorado Springs. This was a cooperative effort that saw the pooling of all the resources available and resulted in a peaceful conclusion.There cannot be enough said about the work that was done by the law enforcement agencies involved. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, The Colorado Springs office of the Bureau of Alcohol and Firearms, the U.S. Marshals office, the Texas authorities, the Teller County Sheriffs office, the El Paso County Sheriffs office, the Colorado Springs Police Department, the Woodland Park Police Department and the Colorado State Patrol did a tremendous job of working together to apprehend the seven fugitives.The effort and support of the residents of Woodland Park and Colorado Springs can't be overlooked. We need to commend people like Wade Holder and Eric Singer. Mr. Holder resides in Woodland Park and is the owner of the RV park where the fugitives were hiding out. He called in a tip to the local authorities after seeing pictures of the fugitives on the America's Most Wanted Web Site. KKTV's Colorado Springs news anchor Eric Singer helped negotiators by conducting a telephone interview with the last two fugitives in order to assure a peaceful surrender. These are just a couple of examples of how the two communities contributed to the successful manhunt.In all of this we should not forget that two law enforcement agents lost their lives in this investigation. Irving, Texas Officer Aubrey Hawkins and Colorado State Trooper Jason Manspeaker both died in the line of duty. Officer Hawkins was brutally shot 11 times and killed by one of the fugitives while responding to a robbery of a sporting goods store in Irving Texas on December 24th. Colorado State Trooper Jason Manspeaker was killed when he crashed his Jeep Cherokee Squad car into a heavy equipment trailer on U.S. Highway 6 in Colorado. The crash occurred while chasing a vehicle suspected of harboring the last two fugitives on January 23rd. Both Officer Hawkins and State Trooper Manspeaker paid the ultimate price for our freedom. My wife Joan and I offer all our compassion, our sympathy and our prayers to the families of both victims. ",

    "title": "THE BUDGET OUTLOOK",
    "text": "Mr. President, on July 20 the senior Senator from the great State of North Dakota made a series of thought-provoking comments on the floor of the Senate. Many of those comments related to a speech Larry Lindsey, President Bush's economic advisor and a distinguished public servant, delivered in Philadelphia on July 19.In his statement my colleague alleges that Dr. Lindsey misrepresented his views on raising taxes at a time of economic slowdown. In fact, on page 12 of his speech, Dr. Lindsey said, ``In recent hearings conducted by Senator Conrad at which Budget Director Daniels testified, the Senator agreed that raising taxes this year might not be a good idea given the economy. But he went on to be clear that next year might be different. He hinted at a tax increase in 2002, just as the economy is recovering.''If, when he made his remarks on the floor of the Senate, Senator Conrad had not seen a copy of Dr. Lindsey's speech, I can well understand that he may not have realized that his allegation on the matter of his favoring a tax increase this year was false. As to Senator Conrad's views on the advisability of a tax increase next year, I must say that the transcript of his floor statement on July 20 only reinforces the view that he might support a tax increase next year when the economy is growing more robustly. Independent observers have drawn the same conclusion about Senator Conrad's views from his public statements. Robert Samuelson, in the July 11 Washington Post wrote, ``To protect on-budget surpluses, Conrad says the Bush administration has `an affirmative obligation to come up with spending cuts or new revenue (tax increases).''' If this is not the case, and Senator Conrad is opposed to tax increases next year, I can assure you that I would applaud his decision.In his Philadelphia speech, Dr. Lindsey provided compelling reasons why we should not even be talking about the possibility of raising taxes next year. First, a tax increase next year would undermine the sense of permanence associated with this year's tax cut. That sense of permanence is key to the success of this year's tax cut. Talk of increasing taxes, or of repealing the tax cut next year, thus reduces the effectiveness of this year's tax cut. Furthermore, you need only look at Japan's experience when it increased taxes early in an expansion. It wasn't pretty.A second point of concern in this dialogue involves the timing of the tax cut. I am pleased to discover the amount of agreement between the administration and Senator Conrad on the need for a fiscal stimulus this year. When he announced his tax program in December, 1999, the President said that the country may need an insurance policy. Thus, while he proposed a basic plan involving a 5-year phase-in, the President left flexible the actual timing of his tax reduction, explicitly letting it depend on macroeconomic circumstances. In January he indicated a need to work with Congress on an acceleration of the tax cut. And in his formal proposal in February, the President said explicitly, ``I want to work with you to give our economy an important jump-start by making tax relief retroactive.'' That was a full month before the distinguished senior Senator from North Dakota proposed his $60 billion tax cut proposal for this year.Fortunately, Congress did pass a fiscal stimulus for 2001. Senator Conrad's floor statement indicates support for a $60 billion tax reduction this year. That figure is very close to the $74 billion figure that actually passed and was signed into law. I don't believe that the $14 billion difference in these figures could be the basis for Senator Conrad's assertion that the administration is ``driving us into the fiscal ditch,'' especially given a $2 trillion Federal budget and the Senator's apparent support for cutting taxes during an economic slowdown.Furthermore, the spending side of the fiscal year 2001 budget was determined last fall under President Clinton. At that time, the President and the Congress increased discretionary spending by more than 8 percent. Had that rate of spending increase been sustained, we certainly would have deficit problems later this decade. Fortunately President Bush proposed a budget, and Congress adopted a budget resolution, with a sharp deceleration of that rate of spending increase.Looking forward, a comparison of the Democratic alternative that Senator Conrad referred to in his remarks and the bill that actually passed is instructive. For example, in fiscal year 2002 the bill that passed the Congress and was signed by the President was scored at $38 billion. By comparison, the Democratic alternative was scored at $64 billion. Would the Democratic alternative tax proposal have driven us into the ``fiscal ditch'' deeper and faster than the President's budget?In fiscal year 2003, the relevant scoring by Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation shows the bill that actually passed cost $91 billion while the Democratic alternative cost $83 billion. In fiscal year 2004 the figures were $108 billion for the bill that actually passed and $101 billion for the Democratic alternative. In fiscal year 2005 the actual legislation cost $107 billion while the Democratic alternative cost $115 billion. Surely this $7 billion difference between the two bills over a three year period cannot plausibly be labeled ``driving us into the fiscal ditch'' either.One must assume that Senator Conrad's assertions are based on the long-term revenue effects of the President's proposal. Yet, in fiscal year 2006 and later no one is forecasting anything but a large budget surplus. Thus, it is hard to find any factual basis for claims that the President's tax plan is ``driving us into the fiscal ditch'' by any definition of that term that does not also apply to the proposals Senator Conrad and his Democrat colleagues advanced during the budget debate.It is apparent from Senator Conrad's remarks that he and Dr. Lindsey differ on the proper measure of fiscal tightness. Dr. Lindsey asserted in his speech that the best measure of the Government's effect on the financial markets is the Unified Budget Surplus. This was a concept created by a special commission appointed by President Lyndon Johnson and has been in use for more than 30 years. It has long been the standard for non-partisan analysis of the budget. For good measure, on page fifteen of his speech, Dr. Lindsey quoted Robert Samuelson regarding the usefulness of alternative definitions.As to the appropriate size of the unified surplus, I concur wholeheartedly with the administration's view that the unified surplus should be at least as large as the Social Security surplus. Dr. Lindsey outlined in his Philadelphia speech why this is appropriate. But, Senator Conrad and Dr. Lindsey disagree fundamentally regarding the right term to apply to Medicare. As Dr. Lindsey stated in his speech, every dollar of Medicare premiums paid by beneficiaries and every dollar of Medicare taxes paid by workers and their employers is spent on Medicare. In addition, Medicare receives $50 billion in extra money from the rest of the Federal budget. Frankly, the ``surplus'' concept does not make much sense under the circumstances.In his floor speech Senator Conrad made an analogy to ``defense,'' noting that all of its funding is paid for from the rest of the Federal budget. But no one talks of a ``defense surplus.'' Indeed, the concept of a ``surplus'' in a program that requires net inflows from the rest of the budget seems to make little sense. I therefore do not see why references to the budgetary funding of defense conceivably supports the assertion that Medicare has a ``surplus.''Finally, Senator Conrad and Dr. Lindsey also seem to disagree on the extent to which the Government should control the fruits of our Nation's labor, saving, and risk-taking. Over the last 8 years, the share of GDP taken in Federal receipts has increased from 17.3 percent to 20.3 percent. Even if the President's original campaign proposal on taxes were to have been enacted, the tax share of GDP would have been rolled back only modestly, and would still have been above the post-War average. I believe that I am on firm ground stating that Senator Conrad's opposition to even this modest rollback means that he supports something close to the current record-setting tax take.As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I urge my colleagues to consider these facts as they consider the appropriate course for fiscal policy in the months and years ahead.",

    "text": "After the Persian Gulf conflict, the international community levied economic sanctions and established the ``Oil for Food'' program. However, these sanctions have largely eroded due to the lack of resolve by the international community and the reality of Iraq's substantial illicit trade. Turkey and Jordan import Iraqi oil via truck routes, Iran escorts oil tankers through territorial waters, an Iraq-Syrian pipeline is the largest export method of Iraqi oil, with an Iraq-Jordan pipeline scheduled to be operational in 2005.The United States attempted to garner support for ``Smart Sanctions'' in early 2001, but this attempt met tepid reception by the international community. Russia, China, and France have negotiated substantial contracts with Iraq which would be executable upon lifting of U.N. sanctions. Under the Oil for Food program, food import levels exceed and oil revenue is comparable to pre-Gulf war levels. The program experiences periodic progressive adjustments in its export ceiling in response to growing international concern about the Iraqi humanitarian condition.However, Saddam Hussein consistently circumvent's the economic sanctions and attempts to thwart the oil for food program. Saddam's regime has exported thousands of barrels of oil each day in violation of UN resolutions and he completely disregards the humanitarian well-being of his own people. By illegally exporting this oil, he has deprived the Iraqi people billions of dollars in food and medicine which would have been allowed under the program.The living conditions of the Iraqi people are intolerable. Saddam Hussein has expanded his violence against women and children, withheld food and medicine from his own citizens, and violated the basic human rights of the Iraqi people.Mr. President, some have blamed the oil for food program and the economic sanctions for these conditions. But let us be very clear, the reason for these intolerable conditions and why we are debating this topic today lay at the feet of Saddam Hussein and his regime. To quote Secretary of State Powell from a Foreign Relations Committee hearing on September 26, ``Iraq stands guilty. It convicts itself by its actions.''The threat of Saddam Hussein is real and is growing. Iraq enjoys a sizable military advantage over all Gulf States except Iran. Iraq's 424,000 military personnel outnumber the combined personnel total of all U.S. Gulf allies. Iraq continues to pursue weapons of mass destruction, and is attempting to acquire a nuclear capability. According to recent reports, it is estimated that if Iraq were to obtain fissile material then Saddam Hussein could build a nuclear bomb within months. United Nations Special Commission has identified gaps in accounting for Iraq's current chemical stockpiles and capabilities and has not accounted for hundreds of tons of chemical precursors and 1000's of delivery warheads. UNSCOM also reported that Iraq has understated their declarations regarding the extent of its biological agents.Again, I would like to quote Secretary Powell from the same hearing, when he stated:We can have debates about the size and nature of the Iraqi stockpile. We can have debates about how long it will take them to reach this level of readiness or that level of readiness with respect to these weapons. But no one can doubt two things: one, they are in violation of these resolutions-- there's no debate about that; and secondly, they have not lost the interest to develop these weapons of mass destruction. Whether they are one day, five days, one year or seven years away from any particular weapons, whether their stockpile is small, medium or large, what has not been lost is the interest to have such weapons of mass destruction.Secretary Powell also made it clear that we aren't alone in our concern regarding the threat of Saddam Hussein. Referencing Arab leaders and their thoughts regarding Saddam, Secretary Powell added, ``There is no question in their minds that he's a threat to regional stability and peace. There is no question in their minds that he is a threat to the region and has demonstrated previously his willingness to use weapons of mass destruction. And there is no doubt in their minds that he continues to have the intent to develop these weapons of mass destructions.''So what now--what do we do? Do we hope that Saddam Hussein goes gently into the night or do we finally stand up to this dictator and let the world know that Saddam Hussein can no longer thumb his nose at the international community.We only need to go back a few weeks to see Saddam's duplicity. On September 16, 4 days after the President's speech at the U.N., the Iraqi government announced it would unconditionally allow the return of U.N. inspectors. However on September 20, Iraq backpeddled on its previous announcement by stating that the definition of ``unconditional access'' means no ``presidential sites'' and 24 hours notice before any inspection.''My reaction to this new definition of ``unconditional'' by Iraq is best summed up in an October 3 Denver Post editorial when it stated, ``Saddam, there you go again.''I ask unanimous consent that the entire article entitled ``Saddam Must Open Palaces'' be printed in the Record.",

    "text": " There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, By Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Craig):S. 1036. A bill to provide for a multi-agency cooperative effort to encourage further research regarding the causes of chronic wasting disease and methods to control the further spread of the disease in deer and elk herds, to monitor the incidence of the disease, to support State efforts to control the disease, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.Mr. President, last year, I joined eleven colleagues in an effort to pass legislation that dealt with the eradication, monitoring, and surveillance of chronic wasting disease. Today, I am offering similar legislation, the ``Chronic Wasting Disease Support Act of 2003.'' Before I discuss the legislation further, I first want to thank Senator Feingold for his leadership on this matter and for working diligently to eradicate the disease. I also want to congratulate the State of Colorado, especially those Departments and Divisions that have been on the leading edge of disease management and eradication. They faced a horrendous task--processing tens of thousands of tests on a tight time frame. While more work lies ahead, they are to be commended for their effort.What was first a serious problem in the western United States, chronic wasting disease now poses a serious threat to every State of the union. As a United States Senator, chronic wasting disease presents not only a great animal health challenge, but a scientific quandary as well. As a veterinarian, chronic wasting disease presents an even greater challenge to the scientific communities of both the States and the Federal Government because we know so little about the disease. This legislation, cosponsored by Senators Feingold, Kohl, Roberts, Campbell, Burns and Craig, is a bipartisan effort to defeat the disease and to send a message that CWD must remain a priority for the Federal Government.The importance of this bill to both the State and Federal Government cannot be emphasized enough. It authorizes $34.5 million in the battle against chronic wasting disease. Although the bill authorizes a substantial amount Federal funding to fight and eradicate the disease, the States will retain their undisputed primacy and policy-making authority with regard to wildlife management. Nothing in this act interferes with or otherwise affects the primacy of the States in managing wildlife generally, or managing, surveying and monitoring the incidence of chronic wasting disease. It is important that all members of our delegation and in both the House and the Senate, coordinate our efforts as we fight the disease.Chronic wasting disease, or CWD, may be a new threat to some. Others may not be familiar with it at all. However, it is not new to those of us in Colorado and Wyoming, who have been dealing with it for over twenty years, and if the disease continues to spread, those unfamiliar with the fatal disease will, unfortunately, become experts in CWD policy. The scientific community has gone to great lengths to deal with the disease on limited budgets. These experts, through scientific publication and Congressional hearings, have told us that, although we have learned a tremendous amount about chronic wasting disease, there is much that we do not know and much that we must do to eradicate it.One thing we do know is that sound science is the answer, and that the Chronic Wasting Disease Support Act of 2003 is intended to greatly increase research, monitoring, surveillance, and management of the disease on all levels. It bolsters testing capacity, diagnostics capabilities, and funding authorization.Increased research and research funding is necessary because the disease is quite simply a mystery--the origin and transmission of CWD remains unknown. Unfortunately, the only way to treat an animal with CWD or to contain the disease is to destroy the animal and cull the herd. Together, we must embark on an ambitious and sound scientific commitment for research and investigation to end chronic wasting disease. That is what this bill calls for--cooperation and collaboration, working together at both the State and Federal level to achieve a common objective. We must end chronic wasting disease, and we must begin our eradication efforts now.The impact CWD will have on wildlife and agriculture is undeniable, and the economic and emotional toll of the disease cannot be overstated. Communities that are economically reliant upon deer and elk related enterprises will feel the impact of CWD as concern about the disease grows. But we can stop this, and we must stop this. We have an opportunity to restore cervid health, to contain the disease, and, most importantly, to eradicate the disease. This is the challenge that I urge my colleagues to accept, and to take decisive action; adequate research funding that is directed toward the complete eradication of chronic wasting disease starts with this authorizing legislation.In those States that are already dealing with CWD, the fiscal demands required to manage the disease is quite apparent. State budgets are stretched thin as they cull wild and captive herds and research for workable solutions to stop the disease. With State budgets already strained, an infusion of Federal resources and technical assistance is required to help the States keep CWD from spreading, to treat infected or exposed populations, and to greatly expand research for testing and possible cures. This bill does just that by providing assistance in the form of grants, Federal research programs and incidence reporting, as well as scientific assistance. State and Federal cooperation will protect animal welfare, safeguard our valued livestock industry, provide relief to family elk ranchers, help guarantee America's food safety, and protect the public health.The Chronic Wasting Disease Support Act of 2003 provides the foundation for a nationwide increase in diagnostic capabilities. Undoubtedly, the spread of CWD and the increased awareness of the disease, will cause the demand for testing to grow exponentially--this bill helps us prepare to handle a large volume of cases efficiently and reliably. The legislation calls for the development of new testing methods to help us understand the disease, as well as developing a live test.Chronic wasting disease presents a common problem to the States and the Federal Government. The Federal conduit role that is provided in the bill will allow animal health experts to unravel the CWD mystery. The challenge we face is to achieve what we all recognize as a common objective--to understand CWD and to eradicate it. But, we must act quickly or this disease will redefine the wildlife characteristics of our States. Thank you, Senator Feingold. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,This Act may be cited as the ``Chronic Wasting Disease Support Act of 2003''.In this Act, the term ``chronic wasting disease'' means the animal disease afflicting deer and elk that-- (1) is a transmissible disease of the nervous system resulting in distinctive lesions in the brain; and (2) belongs to the group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, which group includes scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and Cruetzfeldt-Jakob disease.Congress finds the following: (1) Pursuant to State and Federal law, the States retain undisputed primacy and policy-making authority with regard to wildlife management, and nothing in this Act interferes with or otherwise affects the primacy of the States in managing wildlife generally, or managing, surveying, and monitoring the incidence of chronic wasting disease. (2) Chronic wasting disease, the fatal neurological disease found in cervids, is a fundamental threat to the health and vibrancy of deer and elk populations, and the increased occurrence of chronic wasting disease in regionally diverse locations in recent months necessitates an escalation in research, surveillance, monitoring, and management activities focused on containing, managing, and eradicating this lethal disease. (3) As the States move to manage existing incidence of chronic wasting disease and insulate non-infected wild and captive cervid populations from the disease, the Federal Government should endeavor to provide integrated and holistic financial and technical support to these States. (4) In its statutory role as supporting agent, relevant Federal agencies should provide consistent, coherent, and integrated support structures and programs for the benefit of State wildlife and agricultural administrators, as chronic wasting disease can move freely between captive and wild cervids across the broad array of Federal, State, and local land management jurisdictions. (5) The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and other affected Federal authorities can provide consistent, coherent, and integrated support systems under existing legal authorities.Congress finds the following: (1) Pursuant to State and Federal law, the States retain undisputed primacy and policy-making authority with regard to wildlife management, and nothing in this Act interferes with or otherwise affects the primacy of the States in managing wildlife generally, or managing, surveying, and monitoring the incidence of chronic wasting disease.

    "text": " There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of  By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Campbell):S. 1058. A bill to provide a cost-sharing requirement for the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit in the State of Colorado; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.Mr. President, an historian and poet once penned that the history of Colorado would be written in water. In the midst of Colorado's worst drought in 300 years, this prediction has proven an accurate account of life in the headwater State and has proven a strong reminder that water is indeed our most precious natural resource. Yet in Southeastern Colorado, home of the Arkansas River, finding clean, inexpensive water, can be difficult. That is why today I am introducing legislation that will ensure the expedited construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit--a pipeline that will provide the small, financially strapped towns and water agencies along the Arkansas River with safe, clean, affordable water. By creating a Federal/Local cost share formula to help offset the costs of constructing the Conduit, this legislation will protect the future of Southeastern Colorado.By way of background, the Arkansas Valley Conduit was originally authorized by Congress forty years ago as a part of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project. Due to the authorizing statute's lack of a cost share provision and Southeastern Colorado's depressed economic status, the Conduit was never built. Until recently, the region has been fortunate to enjoy an economical and safe alternative to pipeline-transportation of Project Water: the Arkansas River. Sadly, the water quality in the Arkansas has degraded to a point where it is no longer economical to use as a means of transport. At the same time, the Federal government has continued to strengthen its unfunded water quality standards.In order to comply with these standards, the region's municipalities have begun exploring options for water treatment, some of which are estimated to cost between $20 million and $40 million. Taken together, the municipalities alone are facing potential expenditures of up to $640 million simply to comply with federally mandated water quality standards. Construction of over a half a billion dollars worth of water treatment facilities is simply not a feasible alternative for the financially strapped farming communities along the Arkansas River. With the Conduit, the communities will not need to build new water treatment facilities.In an effort to resurrect the Conduit, last year, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell and I, worked to secure $200,000 for a Bureau of Reclamation Re-evaluation Statement on the project. Thanks to this effort, the people of the valley are beginning to realize that the Conduit is much more than just a pipedream, and that Congress is serious about fulfilling the promise of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project.According to the draft feasibility study, the Conduit is estimated to cost $200 million. My legislation calls for a 75/25 Federal/Local cost share, meaning that the local communities will be required to come up with at least $50 million to pay for their share. This is a sizeable sum, but is a far cry from the $640 million it would cost to build the new treatment facilities that would be required if the Conduit is not built. This will leave $150 million for the Federal government's share. However, I would like to point out that this $150 million undoubtedly would be exceeded if the communities were forced to seek Federal grants to help build new treatment plants.The Arkansas Valley Conduit will deliver fresh, clean water to dozens of valley communities and thousands of people along the river. The local sponsors of the project have initiated and are nearing the completion of an independently funded feasibility study of the Conduit, and have developed a coalition of support from water users in Southeastern Colorado. They continue to explore options for financing their share of the costs, and are working hard to develop the organization that will oversee the Conduit project.With the help of my colleagues, the promise made by Congress forty years ago to the people of Southeastern Colorado, will finally become a reality.I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, By Mrs. HUTCHISON:S. 1059. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to adjust the tax rate for political organizations; to the Committee on Finance.Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to correct an inequity in our tax code.Currently, we use inconsistent standards to tax different types of political campaign committees. Congressional campaigns are taxed at the applicable corporate rates: depending on how much taxable income a campaign generates, it will be taxed at rates that vary from 15 percent to 35 percent. However, all other campaigns must pay the highest corporate rate of 35 percent. This is unfair.It's wrong to tax some campaigns at rates that change according to income level and then arbitrarily charge others at the highest possible rate. This disparity particularly hurts local and State candidates who generally have relatively low levels of taxable income but have to pay the same 35 percent rate as campaigns that may generate more than $10 million in taxable income.The bill I am introducing today will eliminate this inequity by taxing all campaign committees at the corporate rate based on their level of income. No longer will congressional campaigns be allowed to receive preferred tax treatment. All campaigns will be treated the same.I hope my colleagues will support this effort to improve the fairness of the tax code.I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Carper, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Levin, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reid, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Miller, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Graham of Florida):S. 1061. A bill to authorize 36 additional bankruptcy judgeships, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2003, along with over a dozen Senators of both parties who are joining me on this legislation. This bill creates new temporary and permanent bankruptcy judgeships in districts that need them, and extends and converts other temporary judgeships.The substantial increase in bankruptcy case filings in recent years has created a dire need for additional bankruptcy judgeships. My bill would create 23 new permanent bankruptcy judgeships, 5 temporary judgeships, convert 2 temporary judgeships to permanent status and extend 2 other temporary judgeships. 17 States would receive new judgeships, as recommended by the Administrative Office for United States Courts.Among other things, the bill authorizes four new bankruptcy judgeships, and converts one from temporary to permanent status, for the District of Delaware, the Nation's most overloaded bankruptcy district. The most recent data show weighted filings for the district of Delaware surpassing 13,500 per judge, while the next busiest district faces only about 3,000.The bankruptcy bar in Delaware is among the most respected and accomplished in the country, as are our bankruptcy judges. But our judges are not superhuman. They must receive the assistance that this bill would grant them, and I intend to see that they get it.The Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2003 is long overdue and I urge my colleagues to support it.I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,This Act may be cited as the ``Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2003''.The following judgeship positions shall be filled in the manner prescribed in section 152(a)(1) of title 28, United States Code, for the appointment of bankruptcy judges provided for in section 152(a)(2) of such title: (1) Two additional bankruptcy judgeships for the southern district of New York. (2) Four additional bankruptcy judgeships for the district of Delaware. (3) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the district of New Jersey. (4) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the eastern district of Pennsylvania. (5) Three additional bankruptcy judgeships for the district of Maryland.

This legislation is being introduced today by Senator Biden, and is being cosponsored by myself and Senators Carper, Nelson of Florida, Clinton, Edwards, Graham of South Carolina, Hollings, Levin, Pryor, Reid, Chambliss, Miller, Alexander and Graham of Florida.This bill is another significant step forward in our efforts to strengthen Maryland's Federal bankruptcy court. We have been working for several years to get these additional judgeships approved, yet no legislation has been passed that would authorize them. With such inaction, the burden facing Maryland's sitting bankruptcy judges has grown, and Maryland has remained without the additional judgeships it so desperately needs to make our bankruptcy system work.Maryland's four sitting bankruptcy judges continue to show remarkable dedication given the extraordinary burdens placed upon them. However, additional judgeships remain essential to the fair and timely administration of the Bankruptcy Code for all of the businesses and individuals that come before the Maryland District.Since 1992, we have been requesting additional judgeships for the District of Maryland; thus far none have been approved. In 1992, there were approximately 15,000 bankruptcy filings in the District of Maryland. From 1998 to 2002, there were over 30,000 bankruptcy filings per year in Maryland. In the past few years the number of new filings per year has been closer to 35,000, and in 2002 there were 35,900 new cases. The caseload has more than doubled in the past ten years, and the Court still does its work with only four bankruptcy judges. This dire need for additional judgeships in Maryland has yet to be remedied by the Congress.This legislation provides four additional judgeships for Maryland, in accordance with a September 2002 recommendation from the United States Judicial Conference. These four additional judgeships would help reduce the overwhelming workload of the four sitting bankruptcy judges. As of June 30, 2002, the national weighted filing average for bankruptcy judges was 1,641. The weighted filing per judge for Maryland's four bankruptcy judges was 3,030--almost twice the national average. By Mr. CAMPBELL.:S. 1062. A bill to amend section 924 of title 18, United States Code, to increase the maximum term of imprisonment for offenses involving stolen firearms; to the Committee on the Judiciary.Mr. President, this week, May 11 through 17, is ``National Police Week 2003.''This is the week when thousands of law enforcement officers from all over the United States gather here in our Nation's Capital. Representing a full spectrum of our Nation's law enforcement personnel including local, State, and Federal officers, they gather here to honor their fallen comrades, as well as to celebrate all who serve this country and its citizens. Some of this year's highlights include the May 11 ``Law Ride,'' the May 13 ``Candlelight Vigil at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial'' and the May 15 ``National Peace Officers' Memorial Day Service'' which will be held on the Capitol grounds. These events are being held to specifically pay tribute to the more than 145 peace officers who were killed in the line of duty across the U.S. during 2002.In honor of ``National Police Week,'' today I am introducing two bills that will help improve our Nation's justice system and protect the law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line for us all on a daily basis.The first bill I am introducing is the ``Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 2003'' which would increase the maximum prison sentences for violating existing stolen gun laws.A growing number of crimes in our country are being committed with stolen guns. The extent of this problem is reflected in a number of recent studies and news reports which indicate that almost half a million guns are stolen each year.This problem is increasing, and is therefore especially alarming among young people. A Justice Department study of juvenile inmates in four States showed that over 50 percent of the inmates in those prison systems had stolen a gun. In the same study, gang members and drug sellers were also more likely to have stolen a gun.Specifically, this bill would increase the maximum penalty for violating four provisions of the firearms laws. Under title 18 of the U.S. Code, it is illegal to knowingly transport or ship a stolen firearm or stolen ammunition. It is also illegal to knowingly receive, possess, conceal, store, sell, or otherwise dispose of a stolen firearm or stolen ammunition. The penalty for violating either of these provisions is a fine, a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years, or both.My bill increases the maximum prison sentence to 15 years.I am a strong supporter of the rights of law-abiding gun owners. However, I firmly believe we need tougher penalties for the illegal use of firearms.The ``Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 2003'' will send a strong signal to criminals who are even thinking about stealing a firearm. I urge my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 2003 be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,This Act may be cited as the ``Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 2003''. By Mr. CAMPBELL:S. 1065. A bill to establish a matching grant program to help State and local jurisdictions purchase bullet-resistant equipment for use by law enforcement departments; to the Committee on the Judiciary.Mr. President, the second bill I am introducing today is the ``Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 2003''.This bill is named in honor of Officer Dale Claxton of Cortez, CO, a fine law enforcement officer and family man, who was fatally shot through the windshield of his patrol car on May 29, 1998, after stopping a stolen truck. His assailants turned out to be dangerous fugitives and as a result, a large-scale man hunt was launched. The assailants were brought to justice, but Officer Claxton was tragically and prematurely taken away from his wife and four children.``The Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act'' would aid law enforcement agencies in acquiring bullet resistant equipment for their forces, including bullet resistant glass for law enforcement vehicles, hand-held shields and any other equipment that officers may need when they serve on the front lines of law enforcement. Specifically, this legislation would help our Nation's State and local law enforcement officers acquire the bullet resistant equipment they need in order to protect themselves from would-be killers. This legislation would authorize the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance to administer a $40 million matching grant program to assist these agencies purchase bullet resistant equipment.This legislation is a worthy companion, and similar in many ways, to S.764, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, which I recently introduced for reauthorization. Like S. 764, today's bill would help State and local law enforcement agencies acquire bullet resistant equipment--however this bill would simply provide for a wider array of bullet resistant equipment to supplement bullet proof vests.As a former deputy sheriff, I am personally aware of the dangers which law enforcement officers face on the front lines every day. One way in which the Federal Government can improve their safety is to help them acquire bullet resistant glass and other equipment for patrol cars. These partnership grants are especially crucial for officers who serve in small, local jurisdictions that often lack the funds to provide their officers with the life saving equipment they may need.The second component of this legislation would launch expedited and targeted research and development by authorizing $3 million over 3 years for the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice, NIJ, to conduct research and development of new bullet resistant technologies, such as bonded acrylic, polymers, polycarbons, aluminized material, and transparent ceramics.Promising new bullet resistant materials now being developed could be as revolutionary in coming years as the development of Kevlar was in the 1970s for the manufacture of body armor. These exciting new technologies promise to be lighter, more versatile and hopefully less expensive than traditional heavy bulletproof glass.Our Nation's police officers, sheriffs and deputies regularly put their lives in harm's way as they protect the people and preserve the peace. They deserve to have access to the bullet resistant equipment they need. The Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act will both accelerate the development of new lifesaving bullet resistant technologies and then help get them deployed into the field where they are needed. Officers lives will be saved.I ask unanimous consent that the text of Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 2003 be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,This Act may be cited as the ``Officer Dale Claxton Bulletproof Police Protective Equipment Act of 2003''.(a) Findings.--Congress finds that-- (1) Officer Dale Claxton of the Cortez, Colorado, Police Department was shot and killed by bullets that passed through the windshield of his police car after he stopped a stolen truck, and his life may have been saved if his police car had been equipped with bullet-resistant equipment; (2) the number of law enforcement officers who are killed in the line of duty would significantly decrease if every law enforcement officer in the United States had access to additional bullet-resistant equipment; (3) according to studies, between 1990 and 2000, 1,700 law enforcement officers in the United States were shot and killed in the line of duty; (4) the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that the risk of fatality to law enforcement officers while not wearing bullet-resistant equipment, such as an armor vest, is 14 times higher than for officers wearing an armor vest; and (5) the Executive Committee for Indian Country Law Enforcement Improvements reports that violent crime in Indian country has risen sharply despite a decrease in the national crime rate, and has concluded that there is a ``public safety crisis in Indian country''. (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to save lives of law enforcement officers by helping State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies provide officers with bullet- resistant equipment and video cameras.(a) In General.--Part Y of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended-- (1) by striking the part designation and part heading and inserting the following:(a) In General.--Part Y of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended-- (1) by striking the part designation and part heading and inserting the following: ``PART Y--MATCHING GRANT PROGRAMS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT(a) In General.--Part Y of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended-- (1) by striking the part designation and part heading and inserting the following: ``PART Y--MATCHING GRANT PROGRAMS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ``Subpart A--Grant Program for Armor Vests'';(a) In General.--Part Y of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended-- (1) by striking the part designation and part heading and inserting the following: ``PART Y--MATCHING GRANT PROGRAMS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ``Subpart A--Grant Program for Armor Vests''; (2) by striking ``this part'' each place that term appears and inserting ``this subpart''; and (3) by adding at the end the following:(a) In General.--Part Y of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended-- (1) by striking the part designation and part heading and inserting the following: ``PART Y--MATCHING GRANT PROGRAMS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ``Subpart A--Grant Program for Armor Vests''; (2) by striking ``this part'' each place that term appears and inserting ``this subpart''; and (3) by adding at the end the following: ``Subpart B--Grant Program for Bullet-Resistant EquipmentIn the case of any equipment or products that may be authorized to be purchased with financial assistance provided using funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act, it is the sense of Congress that entities receiving the assistance should, in expending the assistance, purchase only American-made equipment and products.Section 202 of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3722) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(e) Bullet-Resistant Technology Development.-- ``(1) In general.--The Institute is authorized to-- ``(A) conduct research and otherwise work to develop new bullet-resistant technologies (i.e., acrylic, polymers, aluminized material, and transparent ceramics) for use in police equipment (including windshield glass, car panels, shields, and protective gear); ``(B) inventory bullet-resistant technologies used in the private sector, in surplus military property, and by foreign countries; and ``(C) promulgate relevant standards for, and conduct technical and operational testing and evaluation of, bullet- resistant technology and equipment, and otherwise facilitate the use of that technology in police equipment. ``(2) Priority.--In carrying out this subsection, the Institute shall give priority in testing and engineering surveys to law enforcement partnerships developed in coordination with high-intensity drug trafficking areas. ``(3) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this subsection $3,000,000 for fiscal years 2004 through 2006.''.",

    "text": "Mr. President, hospitals in the United States have enormous responsibility. The Nation's hospitals care for patients, perform surgeries, train interns, research cures to diseases, and provide millions of dollars annually for the uninsured. Their services improve Americans' health and lives and better our communities. I laud their service to Colorado and the Nation.Recently Solucient, a company that provides health care data to improve health care results, published its list of the Nation's 100 top hospitals. Four of Solucient's designees are Colorado hospitals: Saint Joseph Hospital in Denver, Rose Medical Center in Denver, Swedish Medical Center in Englewood, and Lutheran Medical Center in Wheat Ridge. Solucient determines its selection of top hospitals according to hospitals' consistent and superior quality care, financial performance, and efficient delivery of care. According to Solucient, the Top 100 hospitals treat more, and sicker, patients with better survival rates and fewer complications.I am pleased to acknowledge Solucient's selection of Colorado hospitals for its quality service, dedication, and commitment to providing quality health care for Colorado, the Nation, and the world. First, Solucient has recognized Saint Joe's Hospital in Denver in its studies of orthopedic and intensive care units. According to the hospital, Saint Joe delivers more babies than any other Colorado hospital, serves more patients in gastroenterology, general surgery, pulmonology, cardiac care, nephrology and rheumatology than any other acute care hospital in the Denver metropolitan area, and for the past 5 years the hospital has cared for more cardiology and open heart surgery patients than any other acute care hospital in the metro area.Second, Exempla Lutheran Medical Center specializes in cardiology, oncology, orthopedic services, and women's health care. Lutheran Medical also provides special care to the community through its community clinics, special programs and services for the elderly, and hospice care. In addition, Lutheran Medical Center's Emergency Department has the second highest patient load in the Denver metropolitan area.Third, with a mission of commitment to patients, Rose Medical Center in Denver asserts a reputation for high quality health care and quality customer service. Rose Medical Center specializes in women's health services, general surgery, internal medicine, pediatric care, and emergency services. Rose Medical Center also partners with philanthropic organizations to help offer services to the Colorado community. Further, Rose Medical Center is the official health care provider for the Denver Nuggets professional basketball team and the Colorado Avalanche professional hockey team.Fourth, Solucient recognized a teaching hospital in Englewood, Colorado, Swedish Medical Center, which has six ``Centers of Excellence:'' the Colorado Neurological Institute, adult &amp; pediatric trauma services, advanced radiology capabilities, cardiology services, cancer treatment services, and women's and children's services. In addition, Swedish is a Level I Trauma Center and is a leading referral center for neurotrauma. Swedish also offers services for the elderly, emergency medical service education, and has a Family Medicine Residency Program.I am pleased these Colorado hospitals have been recognized as leaders in quality, efficiency, and financial responsibility in institutional health care. I laud their work and am expectant for their continued high quality of care and progress for Colorado and the Nation.",

    "text": "The Senator from Minnesota. Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect and compassion for my colleague from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and for his commitment to what this institution is all about.I don't know if I can find the words to describe the feeling that I have, elected just this year to the Senate, to these hallowed halls. I listened to the reading from my friend and colleague from Arkansas from Caro's ``The Master of the Senate.'' It is a humbling honor to be part of this body, to be part of the flow of history, a flow that has helped develop the greatest nation in the world. We got there due to divinely inspired guidance from the Founders of this great Republic who gave us a Constitution which provides a sense of clarity of our roles and responsibility. If we decide to only abide by it 98 percent of the time and the folks who follow us decide to abide by it 98 percent of the time, we are in trouble. My colleagues across the aisle have a sign that says 168 to 4. They are proud of that. I am stunned. I am absolutely stunned. If the airline I flew back and forth to Minneapolis would advertise 98 percent of the time they would get me there safely, I wouldn't fly.Think about the Constitution. I could walk you through it. First amendment of the Constitution; Congress shall make no law respecting establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press. If there were 172 newspapers in the United States and I said 168 of them are going to have freedom of the press, but not the other 4, where would we be?Second amendment to the Constitution: Right to bear arms.In Minnesota, we bear arms. A lot of folks were out deer hunting last weekend there. If I were to tell a group of 172 Minnesotans that 168 of you have the right to bear arms, but not 4, 98 percent, I don't think they would be happy Americans.I could go through every amendment. Third amendment: no soldier shall in a time of peace be quartered in any house without the consent of owner, nor in time of war but in a manner prescribed by law, the third amendment to the Constitution. If I went to a group of homeowners and said, you are going to quarter soldiers, 2 percent of you are, they wouldn't be very happy, and they shouldn't be.We took a solemn oath to preserve and defend and abide by the Constitution of the United States. That is how we got here. That is our obligation once we got here. It wasn't a partial thing. It wasn't an almost thing. It wasn't a but-for thing, and it wasn't a 98 percent thing. It was to preserve the Constitution. The fifth amendment to the Constitution: Individuals cannot be compelled to testify against themselves. Can you imagine if we said that applies 98 percent of the time? It doesn't work that way. It should not work that way. There is a reason why. You have to think about this. Again my colleague read the history of the Senate. It is a magnificent history. But the public out there has to ask the question: Why in the over 200 years of this Republic has there never been up until now a partisan filibuster that has stopped judges from being confirmed.Yes, we have the right to advise and consent. The Constitution gives the President the opportunity to appoint judges. We are then to advise and consent. He nominates. We advise and consent. But we do it by a simple majority. We cast our vote. If you don't agree, you vote them down. If you agree, you vote them up. But for the history of this Republic, we have a process which we abide by, the Constitution. That was reflected in the readings from my colleague from Arkansas. Treaties, as he noted in his comments, require in the Constitution a supermajority, but not judges.",

    "title": "CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005",
    "text": "Mr. President, we have heard a lot of discussion about how important eliminating the deficit is. I could not agree more. We do need to eliminate the deficit. The reason we have a deficit today is because this Senate has refused to make tough choices about spending.I make the point that when President Bush assumed office, he came into office when the economy was starting to move down. I don't think anybody can dispute that. When he took office, he was challenged as much as any President in recent history because not only was the economy turning down--and, I might add, with an unprecedented turndown of 2 to 3 years consecutively--but then on top of that we had the September 11 terrorist attack. We went to conflict in Afghanistan, as well as Iraq. It has been a tough time for this President.Fortunately, this country has had strong leadership. Without that strong leadership, I would hate to imagine where we might be today.We look at the combination of all these events as having an impact on revenues coming into the Federal Government. They had an impact on spending. I have been a supporter of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, as have many Members of the Senate, but there has always been a provision in times of conflict that there would be an exception to balance the budget. This is one of those exceptions in time caused by the attack on September 11 against the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. Then we lost a plane in the Midwest. Heroic, Americans on that plane tried to take over that particular plane. So I think it is understandable why the Senate and the House would decide we need to appropriate some dollars to take care of this time of conflict.If we look back, the spending was probably the second most significant thing that contributed to our shortfall as far as eliminating the deficit. The most significant factor was the recession.An analysis has been made by the Joint Economic Committee that has indicated that at least 40 percent--and there are other estimates of at least 49 percent--of the deficit can be attributed to this unprecedented recession.Then, second in line is the amount of spending we have had, somewhere around 35 percent, if my memory serves me correctly. I might be off a few percentage points. And then somewhere around 25, 26, 27 percent--in that area--was attributed to the tax cuts we put in place.The problem has been basically the turndown in the economy and the amount of spending. I think it is all too easy to go ahead and criticize the tax cuts and ignore the major reasons as to why we are having a shortfall in the deficit. I happen to think the tax package we passed when the President was first elected, and then we came back and passed an economic stimulus package, and then last year we passed another package of tax cuts, really did stimulate the economy.We are going to have amendment after amendment on the floor saying we ought to increase spending and increase taxes. I think it is the wrong way to go. I think if we raise taxes, as our economy is showing signs of recovery, it sends the wrong message, and that later on this year we will find our economy still struggling and trying to work its way out of this economic downturn. But if we can sustain these tax cuts--in fact, even those that are expiring, if we go ahead and renew those, I think it will instill confidence in our economy and that we can expect it to continue to do well for the rest of the year.I think the American workers need a break. Frankly, they send a lot of money to Washington. The producers of this country send a lot of money to Washington. From our colleagues on the other side, we hear all about how they want to go ahead and tax the wealthy, the upper 10 percent or the upper 1 percent, and then provide some program of sustained spending that is never going to quit. It is going to continue to grow.If we look at our tax policy, we put taxes in on a temporary period of time--10 years most of them--and then they go away. In our spending programs, we put them in place, and they just seem to go on and on and on.If we look at what happens to those tax figures as we go out in time in the budget, and we look at what happens to the spending figures as we go out in time from this year, the spending increases at a greater rate than the cost from the tax cuts. In other words, if we were to spend an equal amount of money for tax cuts and an equal amount of money for one of the spending programs, as it moves out over time, there is a discrepancy that develops, and spending increases at a greater rate than what happens with the tax cut.I think it is something we need to do. I think it would be shameful if we abandoned the President's plan for economic growth, particularly when the economy is starting to recover.There are those who would argue they do not think the jobs are coming or growing as fast as they would like to see. I agree, we would all like to see the jobs grow faster, but the fact is we are getting job recovery.If we look at the household survey, for example, for a number of months now--close to 9 months--we have seen some phenomenal growth. Why is the household survey important? Because it measures small business. It measures individuals who are out producing on their own, or a few people are out producing on their own. There is no salary. They are all in together. They decide to start a company or provide a service.I am a veterinarian. A lot of them are veterinarians. They are a single-person practice. They are going out there and taking care of the needs of the community, and they are working and creating revenue for their family. They pay property taxes. They are supporting their community. But they never get counted, except in the household survey, because they may very well be operating out of their home.We have a plethora of small businesses that work that way. We have seen this growth. I think a good percentage of that growth has been so phenomenal that they are trying to come up with an explanation for it.Here is my conclusion. I think when we had the downturn in the high-tech sector of our economy, many of those individuals left their former employers with some kind of bonus when they separated, so they had this pocket full of cash. They did not have a job, so they thought: Here is a great opportunity for me to go into business for myself.A lot of these businesses are things that can sustain themselves if you have a good computer system and you can run it out of your home. Your costs are minimal. It is a great opportunity for an entrepreneur to take some idea he may have and start a business for himself, with a relatively inexpensive operation, and running it out of his home. That is the American dream.This is the small business sector. This is where Americans have hope not only of owning their own home, but also of going into business for themselves. A lot of them have this desire.I think when we saw the downturn and a separation of many employees from high-tech companies, they took the separation bonuses they were getting and took this opportunity to go into business for themselves. I think that is great. That is the strength of America.Now let's look at the payroll survey. The payroll survey in the last couple months has been showing a growth. That is the last parameter, historically, that you see happen when the economy is recovering. I think that is great.We saw job growth this month. Maybe it was not as great as some would like to see it. The previous month was a phenomenal figure; in fact, it led to some pretty optimistic projections on job growth this month that did not occur. But I think over time we are going to continue to see this growth in jobs. I think that is very important to the recovery efforts, and our tax cuts have contributed to that. We recognize this in the budget which the Republican Budget Committee has proposed and brought to the floor. I think it is one that recognizes our economy is starting to recover.This economic growth is going to help us eliminate some of our deficit problems. I am optimistic about that. I think we made some tough decisions in this budget when we made some spending decisions.Last year, I told the chairman of the Budget Committee that we simply had to have a plan on how we were going to eliminate the deficit. Obviously, we had to limit the spending parameters. So the Budget Committee went ahead, last year, with a plan as to how to pay down the deficit. What I was watching for this year was to make sure we stayed on plan to eliminate that deficit within 10 years. And we are well within the plan.I was pleased, at the first of this year, when the President endorsed the idea that we needed to have a plan to pay down the deficit. The plan he put forward was a 5-year plan. It said, as a percentage of gross domestic product--which is probably, from an economist point of view, a very realistic way of looking at the impact of our deficit on the economy--that in 5 years we want to eliminate it by one-half.I looked at those figures and, lo and behold, the nominal rate was also reduced in half. Now, this is the actual dollar figure. The Budget Committee did better than that. They eliminated the plan. They did better than that. They reached about where the President was in about 3 years or so. And both the figures--as a percent of gross domestic product and nominally speaking, where we look at actual dollars--has got us well on the way to eliminating the deficit.I am proud to support this budget because we are taking a realistic approach.Spending is a problem. We are going to have to take a serious look at spending. I remember when we passed the budget in 2000, the last year of the Clinton administration, we were trying to adjourn the Congress. In the last few days of that session, we passed over $500 billion in new spending. We had to compromise with then-President Clinton on a lot of his spending priorities. He was moving out of office. We were trying to get out of session so we could move on with the election. That $500 billion in new spending over a 10-year period is now coming home to roost.We are beginning to see phenomenal growth in spending in programs. It strikes me how many people believe we need to do more spending. If we look out at producers in the country, the taxpayers, they are having to take cuts. Many of them are losing their jobs. Yet the agencies can't afford to take a cut. Even the President's budget, as austere as it is, takes care of defense needs. We are in conflict. It takes care of homeland security to protect the country, and we should put our efforts into that. It is a very small increase in the rest of the budget, about .5 percent.The fact is, there is still an increase in spending. While the rest of the country is suffering reductions in their household spending, the Government still claims it needs increases year after year, despite what happens to the economy.There are going to have to be some serious decisions made about spending programs. Some of those decisions are going to be made this year. That is a step in the right direction. We need to look at what it is we can put in place as a policy for the Senate and the Congress to hold down spending. In 2002, a number of provisions we had adopted that would help us restrain spending in the Congress, help us restrain spending on the Senate side, expired. When they expired, we all of a sudden began to see spending increases. We needed to have budget parameters. Thankfully we began to put them in place in the last budget, and we are going to put them in place now with this budget.I know the chairman committed during our Budget Committee deliberations he would work with the ranking member to see if they cannot put together legislation and send a bill to the President he could sign where we could put in place some of the President's recommendations on how we can restrain spending and some of the recommendations of Members in the Senate. They are giving a lot of serious thought to it. I know Senator Conrad, as well as Senator Nickles, is thinking about it. I commend them both for looking at some of these parameters.We have in this particular budget some provisions to help restrain spending in the future. Hopefully we can keep those in the budget, and hopefully they will be applied in a way that will help hold down spending.I want to talk a little bit now about who is paying the taxes. About 1 percent of the population, the top 1 percent, pays 34 percent of the individual income taxes. These are 2001 figures. Then if we look at the top 50 percent, they pay about 96 percent. That means the bottom 50 percent of individual income tax filers is paying the balance, is paying only 4 percent of the individual income tax. We keep hearing talk about how the producers of the country, the top 50 percent of the country, are getting off scot-free. They are the ones who are really making a difference. They are the ones who are making our economy move. I made some comments in this regard yesterday.I also looked at the amount of money. If you take all the income tax filers together, the whole group of them, and you take those paying $100,000 or more in taxes, they pay 75 percent of our total income taxes. So they are paying their fair share.Today a study was brought to my attention that had been done by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Usually I don't pay too much attention because they don't actually end up focusing on tax cuts and the tax issue. But they have come up with some very interesting data, more current than what I was quoting as far as the tax foundation was concerned. The bottom 50 percent of taxpayers is paying minus 3 percent of income taxes. In other words, our earned tax credits are kicking in, and they are showing the bottom 50 percent of the taxpayers is paying a minus 3 percent of income. The earned income tax credit is a cash payment we give to those with lower income. Fourteen percent of the payroll taxes come from that 50 percent.Yesterday somebody said: You didn't talk about the payroll taxes. This bottom 50 percent makes up about 14 percent of the payroll taxes. That is only 5 percent of all income and payroll taxes. So when we combine those together, we come up with 5 percent. That includes your filers, plus the withholding from their taxes.What happens to the top 10 percent of the taxpayers? The top 10 percent pay 71 percent of our income. That is based on the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Thirty-two percent of those are payroll taxes. That is a total of 53 percent of all income and payroll taxes together. So 10 percent of all taxpayers, including income tax plus payroll taxes, are paying 53 percent. The bottom 50 percent is paying 5 percent when you combine them.The producers of this country, the wealthy, if you want to put them in that category, are the ones who are really making a difference.It is time we put aside class warfare and talk about meaningful change in the economy that will make a difference.I yield the floor.",

    "text": "Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Senate's attention the retirement of a Colorado native from the U.S. Army, LTC Julia Cook.Lieutenant Colonel Cook has distinguished herself with exceptionally meritorious conduct while serving in key positions of ever increasing responsibility as an Army quartermaster and human resources officer, culminating her career as a legislative liaison for Secretary of the Army, Office of the Chief Legislative Liaison. During her years of superlative service, Lieutenant Colonel Cook consistently demonstrated exceptional leadership, resourcefulness and professionalism while making lasting contributions to Army soldiers and families, readiness and mission accomplishment. Lieutenant Colonel Cook's 20 years of dedicated and faithful service enhanced the soldiers and the units to which she was assigned and reflects the greatest credit upon herself and the U.S. Army.Lieutenant Colonel Cook was commissioned a second lieutenant through the ROTC program, Quartermaster Corps, after graduating from the University of Colorado in December 1984. Her first assignment, following the quartermaster officer basic course, was to Ft. Leonard Wood, MO, from 1985 to 1986, serving as XO for an AIT company that trained 63Bs and 64Cs and as an assistant brigade S4. She volunteered to serve in Korea from 1986 to 1988, distinguishing herself as tech supply platoon leader in 595th Maintenance Company, K-16 Air Base and as battalion S1, 227th Maintenance Battalion, Youngman. Following her tour in Korea, she completed the quartermaster officer advance course and was assigned to Ft. Carson, CO, from 1988 to 1993. Again she served superbly in a variety of positions, as the 4th ID DISCOM support operations officer; the S2/3, 704th Main Support Battalion; as commander, Company C, 704th Main Support Battalion; and as the division equal opportunity officer. She also deployed on a 6-month rotation to JTF-B, Honduras, serving as the logistics plans officer. From 1993 to 1997 she performed her duties as a soldier assigned to Headquarters, U.S. Army Materiel Command, AMC. She served in a variety of positions including, logistics operations officer in the Emergency Operations Center, staff action control officer for the Secretary of the General Staff, executive officer for the Chief of Staff, special project officer to Project Manager Soldier, and team executive officer for the Secretary of the Army's Senior Review Panel on Sexual Harassment after the Aberdeen Proving Ground Sexual Harassment scandal.After graduation from the Command and General Staff College, she was assigned to the 21st Theater Support Command, Kaiserslautern, Germany, from 1998 to 2001. While overseas, she served as chief, Distribution Management Center, where she developed supply distribution initiatives for a command supporting over 65,000 soldiers in European-based units. Lieutenant Colonel Cook's work enabled the Command to reduce shipping costs through the air challenge process by $2 million for the first two quarters of fiscal year 1999. She served as executive officer of the 191st Ordnance Battalion, Miesau, Germany, and was responsible for internal operations of a 600-soldier battalion consisting of a headquarters and headquarters company, an ammunition company, a quartermaster rigging detachment, and two explosive ordnance disposal companies, all while exercising oversight of a $2 million annual budget. Lieutenant Colonel Cook finished her career serving with the Army's office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison from August 2001 to May 2005 where she was the staff action officer and legislative assistant to the Undersecretary of the Army and the Sergeant Major of the Army. She prepared the Undersecretary and Sergeant Major for all interactions with Congress including hearings, office calls, and phone calls. Finally, she served in the program division as the Army legislative liaison between the U.S. Congress and the Army staff for all issues related to logistics.Through these assignments, Lieutenant Colonel Cook has provided outstanding leadership, advice, and sound professional judgment on numerous critical issues of enduring importance to both the Army and Congress. Her actions and counsel were invaluable to Army leaders and Members of Congress as they considered the impact of important issues. Lieutenant Colonel Cook's dedication to accomplishing the Army's legislative liaison mission has been extraordinary. She is truly an outstanding officer who displays superb professional leadership skills and is totally dedicated to mission accomplishment in the highest traditions of military service, and I thank her for her service to this great Nation.

    "title": "STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS",
    "text": "Mr. President, the events of the past few months remind us of the vital role of first responders in responding to natural disasters and terrorists attacks. First responders are just that: the first to respond. When they arrive on the scene, they often face fluid and volatile situations whereupon they are required to make split-second decisions, each of which has the potential to affect thousands of lives. For this reason, it is important that our first responders receive the training and experience needed to make critical life saving decisions under emergency circumstances. I believe that an essential element of preparing our first responders is to provide them with hands-on experience in simulated, real-world training environments.The importance of real world training was called to my attention by a visit to the Technology Training Center (TTC) in Pueblo, CO. There, I witnessed first hand the tools at our disposal to equip our first responders with the training they need, specifically in the context of rail and mass transit. Already aware of the training facilities at the disposal of our first responders through the Department of Homeland Security's National Domestic Preparedness Consortium (NDPC), TTC's potential to fill a gap in the rail and mass transit environment became apparent.Congress recognized the need to train first responders in the 1998 Appropriations Act, Public Law 105-119, and accompanying report. There, Congress stated that, while the Federal Government plays an important role in preventing and responding to these types of threats, state and local public safety personnel are typically first to respond to the scene when such incidents occur. As a result, Congress authorized the Attorney General to assist state and local public safety personnel in acquiring the specialized training and equipment necessary to safely respond to and manage terrorist incidents involving weapons of mass destruction.On April 30, 1998, the Attorney General delegated authority to the Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs (OJP) to develop and administer training and equipment assistance programs for state and local emergency response agencies to better prepare them against this threat. To execute this mission, the Office of Justice Programs established the Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) to develop and administer a national Domestic Preparedness Program.Upon passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-296, the ODP was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security from OJP. In 2003, a number of grant programs and functions from other DHS components were consolidated with ODP, including the NDPC, under a new DHS agency, the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness (SLGCP).Today, SLGCP is the Federal Government's lead agency responsible for preparing the nation against terrorism by assisting states, local and tribal jurisdictions, and regional authorities as they prevent, deter, and respond to terrorist acts. SLGCP's ODP provides tailored training to enhance the capacity of States and local jurisdictions to prevent, deter, and respond safely and effectively to emergency situations.ODP draws upon a coalition of ``training partners'' in the development and delivery of state-of-the-art training programs. This coalition is composed of government facilities, academic institutions, and private organizations, all of which are committed to providing a variety of specialized training for emergency responders across the country.ODP's major training partner is the NDPC, through which ODP identifies, develops, tests, and delivers training to state and local emergency responders. The NDPC includes: ODP's Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP): CDP provides advanced, hands-on training to members of the emergency response community in the areas of command, advanced hazmat, and tactical operations. CDP is the only WMD training facility that provides hands-on training to civilian emergency responders in a toxic chemical agent environment. New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NMIMT): NMIMT, a world leader in explosives research, serves as the lead NDPC partner for explosives, firearms, and incendiary devices training. New Mexico Tech also delivers a program on suicide bombing prevention. Louisiana State University (LSU): LSU provides training and expertise in the areas of law enforcement, bioterrorism, agricultural terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, and mass casualty incidents. Texas A&amp;M University System, Texas Engineering Extension Service (TEEX): TEEX develops and conducts national WMD preparedness training for all emergency response disciplines, as well as courses in incident management/unified command, threat and risk assessments, operations for public works, and WMD operations for emergency medical services. TEEX also conducts a structural collapse technician course to build state capabilities for urban search and rescue operations. Department of Energy's Nevada Test Site (NTS): NTS conducts radiological and nuclear training at NTS and via mobile training teams. It also develops and delivers radiological/nuclear mobile training at the awareness and operations levels and conducts train-the-trainer courses for first responders across the country.Although it consists of an impressive array of training facilities, the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium is not statutorily authorized and does not include a facility that is uniquely focused on emergency preparedness within the railroad and mass transit environment. Therefore, in addition to specifically authorizing the NDPC, this bill incorporates the Transportation Technology Center into the Department of Homeland Security's National Domestic Preparedness Consortium, filling a critical gap in its current training agenda.TTC is a federally-owned, 52 square mile multi-modal testing and training facility in Pueblo, Colorado, operated by the Association of American Railroads (AAR). In 1985, TTC established an on site Emergency Response Training Center (ERTC) to train railroad officials to safely handle accidents involving tank cars carrying hazardous materials. The training proved to be so successful that attendance was opened up to other emergency responders. TTC now serves not only the transportation service industry, but also the public sector emergency response community, the chemical industry, government agencies, and emergency response contractors from all over the world.Each year, an average of 1,700 first responders--from Portland, ME to Portland, OR--travel to Pueblo, CO, to participate in TTC's training program. Former participants include over 600 fire departments and entities from 45 states; 16 state police agencies from Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, and Washington; and numerous government agencies, including the U.S. Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Customs Service, Federal Bureau of Investigations, Environmental Protection Agency, Drug Enforcement Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Transportation Safety Board. In its 20 year history, the facility has trained more than 20,000 students worldwide.The ERTC is regarded as the ``graduate school'' of hazmat training because of its focus on hands-on, true to life, training exercises on actual rail vehicles, including tank cars and passenger rail cars. The ERTC is uniquely positioned to teach emergency response for railway-related emergencies with 69 railway freight cars, 15 railroad passenger cars, 25 highway cargo tanks, van trailers, and intermodal containers, and computer work stations equipped with the latest emergency response software. The Passenger Railcar Security and Integrity Training Facility is currently being developed to test various inspection, response, and remediation techniques' effectiveness for mitigation to incidents involving passenger railcars. This facility focuses on chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosive incidents and other activities associated with potential terrorist events.The distinctive environment of TTC allows testing and training activities to be carried out at a remote Colorado location without disruption to the flow of passenger and rail traffic in and around urban areas. Its inclusion in the NDPC presents a unique opportunity to enhance technology and training that will improve our Nation's ability to prevent, minimize, and respond to potential terrorist attacks similar to those recently seen in London and Madrid.It is for these reasons, among others, that I rise today to introduce a bill statutorily authorizing the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium, as expanded to include the Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, CO, and providing for its coordination and use by the Department of Homeland Security in training the Nation's first responders.",

    "title": "FIRST SESSION OF 109TH CONGRESS",
    "text": "I rise today to speak in review of the first session of this 109th Congress. I have served in the Congress since 1991, and I can say without exaggeration that this year has been the single most productive year I have participated in. As I will detail, we have passed numerous significant legislative items, some of which have languished in Congress for many years. We have stayed a determined course in the global war on terror, maintaining our commitment to our troops and to those eager to adopt a democratic way of life in place of tyranny. We have stayed a proven course to reduce the tax burden on Americans and on American business. Economic indicators in the markets, home ownership data, and employment all illustrate the wisdom of this course. This Congress has shown a very real commitment to principle. While there are those in this body and in the media who would like to deny it, I am confident that this session of Congress will go down in history as singularly productive and representative of the will of the people.The list of significant legislative items passed and signed into law this year is extensive. We got off on the right foot by passing a budget resolution out of the Senate on March 17, and the Congress adopted the budget conference report on April 28. This is amazingly early when compared to the struggles we have encountered in recent years. The Budget, as I have said many times before, is a vital blueprint for our work and a responsibility we must assume to serve the taxpayers. I am a member of the Senate Budget Committee and a former member of the House Budget Committee, and I am pleased to say that our chairman in the Senate has been as efficient and principled an advocate for good budgeting policy as I have ever worked with.In previous years, we have also struggled to complete our work on appropriations legislation. The House, where appropriations measures are to originate, reported every single appropriations bill out of committee by June 21. The Senate passed every bill before October 27. Today, as we wrap up a few remaining issues, all but the Defense and Labor-HHS bills have been signed into law, but it is important to note that these bills were passed by the Senate in October. The leadership on both sides of the Capitol and the members of the various appropriations subcommittees certainly deserve accolades for making such quick work of these difficult legislative items.Congress passed the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act authorizing more than $286 billion of investment in our national infrastructure. The Congress also took a major step forward this year by passing a comprehensive energy policy. A comprehensive energy policy will help America meet long-term demands for energy. This policy will encourage greater domestic production, fuel diversity, research and development of new energy technologies, and an across-the-board improvement of energy infrastructure. One piece of this forward-looking policy includes the Oil Shale Development Act, which I worked on with my colleagues. This has been a prominent issue for years, but we have made the right policy decision, and it is one that will benefit millions of Americans in the decades to come. This year, Congress also addressed the energy needs of low-income families by increasing funds for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program, LIHEAP. Increased funding for this program will help those in need as winter grows more cold.The work we have done on energy and transportation represents historic commitments to the public good. Virtually no aspect of our economic prosperity is unaffected by our fortunes in transportation and energy, and I am pleased to have been a part of these policy achievements.After years of opposition that cost consumers untold millions, Congress finally passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, the first major revision to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since 1978. This law will save approximately $3 billion a year for consumers through lower interest rates and better products and services. Consumers will further benefit from The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and the Class Action Fairness Act. The former puts an end to the frivolous lawsuits that sought to financially drain lawful firearms manufacturers for the acts of criminals, and the latter curbs abuses in our courts that have driven costs for consumers up without benefitting the public. Frivolous lawsuits forced the firearms industry to spend nearly $200 million a year to defend itself from third-party actions and class action lawsuits had grown over 1,000 percent nationwide. Lawyers were getting rich while consumers suffered. These two bills represent a major accomplishment for both consumers and American business. We also passed the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Implementation Act which will benefit American business, consumers, and our neighbors in this hemisphere.I would like to highlight another recent achievement of this administration and of this Congress that we celebrated this week when the first shipment of U.S. beef since December 2003 arrived in Japan. As my colleagues know the Japan Government recently declared that U.S. beef is every bit as safe as Japanese beef and that the beef trade may resume. This is a tribute to sound science, the hard work of our beef producers, and the diligent work of policymakers. It is with some pride that I note the first shipment of beef to be shipped to Japan was sent from Denver, CO.In addition to these notable and historically significant accomplishments, the Congress has also passed a more humble pair of consumer-friendly items in the Junk Fax Prevention Act and The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act. These aren't the kinds of bills that the Washington, DC, crowd may see as being vital national issues, but these are issues felt deeply by our constituents and the small business community.It cannot be overstated that these policies have fostered continued economic growth and prosperity. More than 56,000 jobs were created in our economy in October this year, and more than 4.2 million jobs have been created sine May 2003. Unemployment continues to steadily decline as more Americans than ever are working. This is a remarkable feat by policymakers, investors, small businesspeople, and families across the country. Our economy is strong.Congress continued the national commitment to our men and women in uniform in a variety of ways this year. Though we await completion on the Department of Defense appropriations bill, we have already passed into law more than $80 billion for the further prosecution of the war in Iraq, the reconstruction of Afghanistan, and aid for our international partners. We have increased the pay of our service men and women with an across-the-board 3.1 percent raise, increased housing allowances, increased bonuses for additional retention and recruiting, and increased specific bonuses for those deployed overseas. We have also increased the maximum life insurance allowed for an insured veteran or service member and secured more than $140 million for body armor and personal protection.I am particularly pleased with the steps we have taken to support our troops. Too often policymakers talk the talk without regard to action. It is my hope that we will continue to be responsive and supportive of our troops. The people of the United States are grateful for their dedication and courage. We tackled important veterans health issues this year, as well, by passing the Veterans Medical Services Supplemental. This legislation provided $1.5 billion to meet our commitment to those who have served our Nation.The same Defense supplemental appropriations bill included almost a billion dollars in aid for those impacted by the tsunami in the Indian Ocean almost a year ago, including more than $650 million for the Recovery and Reconstruction Fund.Though not a legislative accomplishment, this would be a good time to mention the tremendous yield we have seen from the years of work by this administration, the military, and Congress. This year started with Parliamentary elections in Iraq to democratically select those responsible for drafting the framework of a free Iraq. In October, the Iraqi people approved their new constitution, and the mechanisms of democracy are still working. In Afghanistan, after many years of turmoil, we also witnessed the free election of a Prime Minister and of the new Parliament. We must stay this course.In the past year, we have also enacted a series of legislative proposals to provide relief to families in the gulf region. The unprecedented impact of Hurricane Katrina demanded an immediate response. The Gulf Coast Emergency Water Infrastructure Assistance Act, The Community Disaster Loan Act, The Natural Disaster Student Aid Fairness Act, Pell Grant Hurricane and Disaster Relief Act, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Emergency Response and Recovery Act, and Katrina Tax Relief Act, among others, put us on the road to recovery. The pair of emergency supplemental appropriations bills that Congress passed total well over $65 billion and have provided needed infrastructure, security, and humanitarian relief. While there is a great deal of work to be done in the Gulf States, Congress has and will continue to demonstrate an ongoing commitment to this region.Congress also engaged in one of the most important debates we could hope to have as far as our national security is concerned, that of enhancing the security of our borders. This year's Homeland Security Appropriations Act provides unprecedented funding to protect our borders from those who wish to enter illegally. This year we passed more than $31 billion in new budget authority for the Department of Homeland Security, increasing border security accounts, providing an additional 1,000 border patrol agents, and providing more 220 detention beds.Among the most high-profile issues of the year were the nominations, hearings, and thus far one confirmation for the U.S. Supreme Court. Not only did the Senate confirm John Roberts to the Court, but Justice Roberts was also named to be the new Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. In the time since Chief Justice Roberts came before the Senate, we have also worked through a pair of nominations, one of which we will take up as our first order of business in the new year. The Roberts nomination demonstrated the value of our system and all of its various parts, working together for a greater good. I look forward to the timely hearings on Judge Alito's nomination and an up-or-down vote on his nomination.This has been an amazing year of accomplishment for the Congress. As I said earlier, there has not been a more productive year in my time here. As proud as I am of these many accomplishments I would also like to discuss a few accomplishments a little closer to my home, the State of Colorado, where we have had a pretty big year, as well.One of the ongoing projects I have worked on for many years now is the cleanup of Rocky Flats. This year, we secured more than $560 million for the final stages of the cleanup. Contrary to what many may expect, this cleanup was completed ahead of time and below projected costs, serving both the region and the taxpayer by cleaning up this facility.Another long-term project that I have worked on is the destruction of chemical weapons at the Pueblo Depot. By working with the Department of Defense, we have increased funding and maintained good management principles to meet our treaty obligations in the destruction of more than three-quarters of a million chemical weapons on site.Just down the road from Pueblo is Fort Carson. I recently held a town meeting at Fort Carson to discuss a variety of issues important to that base and to that community, including the political process that accompanies BRAC. We secured more than $120 million in military construction funds for new barracks and training at the facility as well as securing funds to prevent encroachment at the base. Even further on up the road is another jewel in America's military infrastructure, the U.S. Air Force Academy. Our ongoing efforts to assess progress and address problems at the Academy have been very productive thus far, and we secured $18 million to upgrade academic facilities and family housing this year. It is with some pleasure that I can also say I attended all four board of visitor meetings at the academy this year.This has also been a year of accomplishment for Colorado's space industry. This year we added $60 million for military satellite projects in Colorado, secured $12 million for the space control facility at Peterson Air Force Base, and $6 million for the space warning facility in Greeley. In keeping with these efforts to modernize and expand our posture in space I held four Space Power Caucus events. Space is indeed a great frontier, and it is one where we must maintain an aggressive stance. Just as it is important that the military sector be moving forward in space, it is equally vital that our workforce and our students learn about space science and perform cutting-edge research. This year we secured more than $10,000,000 for student space programs at the University of Colorado, Colorado State University, the Challenger Learning Center, and the Space Foundation. The students who will benefit from these programs are our future.Students in my home State will likewise benefit from our continued support of the University of Colorado's Center for Micro and Nano-technology, which will receive three-quarters of a million dollars for cutting edge scientific research that dwells on the cutting edge. Congress has seen fit to support Colorado State University's Pueblo campus, as well, providing $250,000 for the Western Forensic Law Enforcement Training Center.I spoke earlier of the importance of the highway bill and its impact on our Nation's infrastructure. In Colorado, this will translate in to a variety of projects. We secured $80,000,000 for the T-Rex highway improvement program, $5 million for the west corridor, and $9 million for the Colorado Association of Transit Agencies, a statewide coalition of agencies focused on the future of mass transit in my home State. Our successful year of investment in infrastructure includes a variety of projects around the State, including projects such as the Rio Grande bike trail in Garfield County, funding for the Pikes Peak Highway, State Highway 145 from Dolores to Stoner, the Ports-to-Plains Corridor, and Frisco's West Main Street.In the Agriculture Appropriations Act we secured more than $300,000 for the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Services for the Russian Wheat Aphid Resistance, Stress Tolerance and Quality Enhancement Project, more than 800,000 for infectious disease research to the Center for Economically Important Infectious Animal Diseases at Colorado State University, and almost $900,000 for the National Beef Cattle Evaluation Consortium, comprised of Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Cornell University, and the University of Georgia.Our efforts this year also yielded $400,000 for tamarisk eradication efforts, more than $10,000,000 for new science and technology facility at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and $10,000,000 for design and construction of a new NREL Administrative Facility, and more than $55,000,000 for the Animas-La Plata project. In addition to securing funding to help my home State combat chronic wasting disease, we worked this year to direct the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA to begin to promulgate rules for dealing with this disease.Another ongoing project that I have been pleased to work on with my colleagues is the modernization and expansion of the Centers for Disease Control lab in Ft. Collins. This facility, which provides vital research on vector-borne disease, will receive $24,000,000 this year.We have been very fortunate in the State of Colorado. I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues in recognizing the vital research, military, and educational facilities housed in Colorado.On a more personal note, this year I opened a new State office in Durango, CO. I would like to urge colleagues, if they have not been, to pay a visit to this charming mountain community in southwestern Colorado. Durango offers terrific recreation in summer and winter, and I look forward to being able to enhance my constituent service with this new office.Each of my State offices and my office here in Washington joined with the University of Denver and the University of Northern Colorado this year to host the sixth annual Allard Capitol Conference. This year, we hosted more than 100 Colorado citizens for 3 days of civic learning and participation. This annual conference is one of the most enjoyable things I am able to do with constituents each year.It has been an extraordinary year of accomplishment for the Congress and for Colorado. We have a tremendous amount of inertia going in to the second half of the 109th Congress, and I look forward to the new year and all of its challenges.",

    "title": "CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2007",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Akaka amendment. The reason I do is I am supporting the Burns amendment primarily because it negates the need for the fee proposals in the President's budget and increases funding for research. The President already provides an 11-percent increase from the fiscal year 2006 level, and over the years from 2001 it is a 69-percent increase. There may be some increased needs as we move through the next budget year for veterans. If that happens, then I see no problem with us going ahead, and the Senate historically has always been more willing to put that money in an emergency supplemental.The concern I have with the Akaka amendment is that it increases taxes. There were a number of amendments that were offered--and I assume they will be offered on the floor--in the Budget Committee that raise taxes to take care of this program or that program. The point I would make is that the tax reductions we did a number of years back have served this economy well, and when you allow the economy to grow, then all these programs are going to benefit indirectly because you increase revenues to the Federal Government. I would like to elaborate on that just a little bit before the Senator from Washington makes her statement.If I might just talk a little bit about some of the comments made by the other side, in particular Senator Conrad, as to what happens when we cut those taxes, reduced those taxes known as the President's economic growth package. It was predicted that when we would do that we would reduce employment. Senator Conrad noted for the record that the President has ``put us on a fiscal course that means lower employment.'' In reality, employment went up as reflected in this chart. He predicted that there would be ``a raise in interest rates,'' that the Republican budget would ``raise equilibrium real interest rates.'' That is Senator Conrad, again, in the Congressional Record.In reality, interest rates have stayed down. The statement was made that ``the economic growth package will crowd out private sector investment.'' Again, the comments were proven wrong by what happened to our economy. We see here that the private business investment surges.Then, the ``determining the economic growth'' comment that was made by Senator Conrad, again in the Congressional Record, that ``the budget will undermine potential gross domestic product and hurt economic growth,'' we see right here that we sustained economic growth.So the bottom line is that when we cut taxes, we help the economy. So I think it is bad to try to increase taxes at a time when our economy is doing so well. That is the objection I have to the Akaka amendment.I sympathize with him in making sure that we have enough money to take care of our veterans, particularly at a time when we are in conflicts. But I also need to make sure we have some accountability as far as taxpayer dollars are concerned, how they are spent. I think the President has been very generous with the 11-percent increase he is advocating from 2006 to 2007. He does that without increasing taxes. He has found a source of funding which negates the fees that were proposed in the President's budget a lot of us would just as soon not be there.So I find myself supporting the Burns amendment and opposing the Akaka amendment pretty much based on tax issues that are in those two amendments. I just think this would be the wrong time to increase taxes, when it would have just the opposite effect of the tax cut we implemented a few years back.So I just wanted to make that point. I think on this side you are going to find that we all support veterans. I can't recall a year when we haven't given substantial increases to veterans. But we also need to have some accountability in this process, and I think we restore that through the Burns amendment.I yield the floor.",

    "text": "I am very disappointed we cannot get that amendment up. I have been working now for some time to get that amendment to move forward. It is an amendment I filed last week. It is a simple, commonsense amendment that denies visas to advocates of terrorism. Yesterday morning, I came to the Senate to speak on that amendment and asked for a vote.Now, more than 24 hours later, we have still not had a vote on my simple, 14-line amendment. It is just one example of the Democrats continued obstruction of well intentioned efforts to debate and make improvements to the immigration bill.Put simply, the Democrats are denying me a vote on my proposal to deny visas to terrorists. Any Democrat who says this is anything other than partisan obstructionism are themselves in denial.To demonstrate the height to which this obstructionism has risen, I am again going to explain what my amendment does and how simple it really is.My amendment is so simple, in fact, that it adds only 6 words to the entire Immigration and Nationality Act. And half of those are the word ``or.'' The other three are ``advocate,'' ``advocates,'' and ``advocated.''These 6 words are narrowly targeted to address a loophole in our current visa system that is evidenced by the following statement:Colleagues, believe it or not, this a heading from our very own Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual. The same Foreign Affairs Manual issued to the Department's 25,000 employees located in more than 250 posts or missions worldwide.Even more alarmingly, this is from the chapter that instructs our consular officers to whom visas should be issued. Visas are, of course, the ticket that foreigners, including terrorists, need to enter the This instruction says to the consular officer deciding whether or not to issue a visa that they need not deny a visa to an individual who advocates terrorism. I, for one, cannot imagine a more pertinent ground for denial. If advocacy of terrorism is not grounds for exclusion, I don't know what is.Not only am I concerned about the message this sends to our dedicated consular officers, I am just as concerned about the message this sends to terrorists. It says to them, feel free to lay the groundwork for an attack at home, apply for a visa, and come to America to finish the job. This is not the message that the U.S. should be conveying to terrorists.This Congress has already passed important legislation denying visas to terrorists, including in the PATRIOT and REAL ID Acts. The REAL ID Act, signed into law on May 11, 2005, specifically states that one who endorses or espouses terrorist activity is inadmissible.The real REAL ID Act became public law on May 11 of last year, 8 days after publication of this manual. Yet, today, more 10 months later, the State Department is still instructing its consular officers that advocacy of terrorism may not be a ground for exclusion.Clearly, the State Department needs to be sent a message that we, in Congress, are serious about securing our borders. And particularly serious about preventing known advocates of terrorism--people who are most likely to wish harm to our country--from entering into the United States.Admittance to the United States is a privilege, not a right. My amendment says, if you advocate terrorism, you lose the privilege of coming to the United States.I would like the opportunity to debate this amendment. I, for one, am curious to hear from the Democrats their reason for opposing it.It is a common sense amendment worthy of debate and a vote. I urge my colleagues to join me in calling for a vote on this legislation that slams the door shut in the face of advocates of terrorism who seek to enter our country.I also submitted a second amendment last week which I believe is another commonsense amendment to improve the immigration bill.My amendment No. 3213 calls upon the administration to develop a plan for securing the borders to curb the inflow of vast quantities of methamphetamine into this country. Our Nation has been hard hit by the illegal trafficking of methamphetamine. My home State of Colorado is no exception. In just 10 years, methamphetamine has become America's worst drug problem--worse than marijuana, cocaine or heroin.According to estimates from the DEA, an alarming 80 percent of the methamphetamine used in the United States comes from larger labs, increasingly abroad, while only 20 percent of the methamphetamine consumed in this country comes from the small laboratories.Therefore, my simple amendment calls for a formal plan that outlines the diplomatic, law enforcement, and other procedures that the Federal Government will implement to reduce the amount of methamphetamine being trafficked into the United States.My amendment aims to build upon the methamphetamine provisions of the PATRIOT Act. We must impress upon the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security the immediate need for a firm plan of action. It is imperative that such a plan include, at a minimum, a specific timeline to reduce the inflow of methamphetamine into the United States.There must be a tough standard for keeping excessive amounts of pseudophedrine products out of the hands of methamphetamine traffickers. We must outline a specific plan to engage the top five exporters of methamphetamine precursor chemicals. It is important that we protect our borders to ensure national security and the safety of our communities.Now, here we are today, 1 week to the day after filing my methamphetamine amendment, and still there has been no opportunity for a debate, much less a vote. I urge my colleagues from across the aisle to allow us to proceed on this and other amendments worthy of debate.Mr. President, I yield for a question from the Senator from Illinois.",

I know this is also being discussed by the leadership. That is the one which states that advocates of terrorism be denied a visa.I have two amendments. My hope is we can get that particular amendment up for a vote. It is the one I just recently asked for a vote on and was denied by your side.

    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks recognizing the Reverend Roger Patrick Joseph Dorcy.The Reverend Roger Patrick Joseph Dorcy was born to Michael and Ellen Dorcy on July 4, 1946. Named for his Aunt Patricia, Patrick Joseph Dorcy was the third youngest of 14 siblings.Growing up in Omaha, NE, he attended Holy Cross School, Creighton Preparatory School, and Mount Michael Abbey.From 1967 to 1969 he worked for Senator Robert F. Kennedy in New York and Washington, DC.He received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from St. Meinrad School of Theology in Indiana and completed post-graduate work at Catholic University of America in Washington, DC.Prior to his ordination to the priesthood he was a member of the Order of St. Benedict, St. Meinrad Archabbey. It was there he took the name Roger. Brother Roger was one of the order's youngest teachers, the Archabbey architect, a paramedic, and a firefighter.When he left the Monastery, he moved to Colorado where he taught theology and English at St. Scholastica Academy in Canon City, CO. Finally answering his call, at the age of 33, Roger Patrick Dorcy was ordained a priest in the Diocese of Pueblo, Colorado, on January 29, 1980.He served as pastor at Sacred Heart Church and campus minister at Adams State College in Alamosa, CO. He was associate pastor at St. Leander's and Our Lady of Guadalupe Churches in Pueblo.

    "title": "WAR ON TERROR",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to discuss recent events that are positive steps in the war on terror for the United States and our allies abroad. The first is the announcement that the United States and foreign counterterrorism officials have worked together to make a series of arrests that appear to be linked to a web of Islamic extremists in Canada, the United States, and Europe. The recent death of Iraqi insurgent leader and al-Qaida member Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi is another. These are significant victories against those who wish our country harm.Last week, Canadian officials arrested 17 people for allegedly plotting to carry out a campaign of bombings, kidnappings and other terrorist acts in Ottawa and Toronto. The arrests were made possible by the monitoring of Internet chat rooms and e-mail accounts tied to suspected Islamic extremists. The arrests came after three tons of ammonium nitrate--common garden fertilizer that is easily transformed into an explosive--was allegedly purchased from undercover officers. Two of 17 suspected terrorists were caught trying to smuggle guns and ammunition from the United States into Canada via the Peace Bridge last summer.These individuals were allegedly using the Internet to communicate with terrorist facilitators abroad, such as a 22-year-old Web site operator with direct links to al-Qaida who was arrested by British police last October on charges of financing and supporting terrorist activities. Authorities believe the Web site operator was in contact with the individuals in the Canadian arrests, as well as two men in the U.S., sharing surveillance videos and other information for potential terrorist attacks. Included in the surveillance videos were many Washington, DC, landmarks.Also, just last Tuesday British police arrested an American student in London as he prepared to board a flight to Pakistan. He was wanted in New York for allegedly providing military equipment to people who took it to members of Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization in Pakistan. Authorities have not ruled out a connection to the Canadian arrests.Here in the U.S., the New York and Atlanta joint terrorism task forces recently arrested two men in connection with an alleged terrorist plot. The plot included discussions about blowing up oil refineries and disabling navigational aids on airplanes. The investigation began when California police arrested two men for a gas station robbery. A subsequent search of their home turned up documents listing the addresses of U.S. military recruiting stations, the Israeli Consulate, and synagogues in the Los Angeles area. The investigation eventually revealed the existence of a terrorist cell that had been spawned by a small radical group operating in Folsom Prison who considered themselves the ``al-Qaida of California.''American counterterrorism officials are joining forces with their colleagues around the world to unravel intricate webs of terrorist organizations that would do us great harm if not for the efforts of these countterror experts. I commend them for their efforts to discover terrorist plots and bring them to a stop before they are carried out.Much further from home, but still close to our hearts are the brave men and women of our Armed Forces deployed in the Middle East and Afghanistan.I thank our servicemen and servicewomen in the U.S. Armed Forces for their on-going service to their country, their commitment to American ideals, and their determination to win the global war on terror. We need to continually express our gratitude to the families of the U.S. military personnel, especially those families who have lost loved ones during our most recent deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.Most important, our Armed Forces continue to seek out terrorists to disrupt their plans both in the Middle East and abroad. They also continue to provide support and guidance to the Iraqi and Afghani people in their newborn democracies. With their steadfast courage, our citizens in uniform have taken the battle to the enemy and achieved success.Their most recent victory was the elimination of insurgent leader and al-Qaida member Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. His death is an enormous blow to those who continue to terrorize the Iraqi people. Zarqawi, whom Osama Bin Laden has heaped praise upon, has lead a horrific campaign against our troops in Iraq and against the Iraqi people. I am thankful to say that this mass murderer will no longer be able to carry on attempts at undermining the Iraqi national government and the coalition.Of note in his demise is the international cooperation that spearheaded the operation. After receiving tips and intelligence of his location from Jordanian sources, Coalition forces killed Zarqawi and many of his lieutenants yesterday in an airstrike. It was this exchange of intelligence information between the United States and Jordan that helped to permanently end Zarqawi's operations. I should also note that the Iraqi police were first on the scene after the air strike to help identify our success.Also, perhaps lost among this news yesterday was another announcement made by Prime Minister Al-Maliki of Iraq that candidates have been named for important cabinet posts in the Iraqi government. After much negotiation, consensus picks were made to fill the defense and interior ministries--both key to a more secure and stable Iraq. Much of our success depends on the men and women forming the Iraqi government, and these are important steps to meeting the security challenges.The recent announcements in Iraq and our international counterterrorism efforts, while significant, are only small victories in the overall global war on terror. There are more extremists who will line up to preach against democracy and freedom. There are still those that will attack the free people of this world and want to do us much harm.After news of Zarqawi's death, the forces of al-Qaida in Iraq vowed publicly to continue their so-called ``holy war'' on innocent civilians. They have stated:The death of our leaders is life for us. It will only increase our persistence in continuing holy war so that the word of God will be supreme.In fact, only two hours after the Zarqawi announcement a bomb blew up in Baghdad killing at least nineteen people. It is clear that our success in Iraq against this enemy depends greatly on our continual cooperation with the Iraqi government and the new ministers in charge of security there.The global war on terror has been a great challenge for our Nation. Yet while the cost has been high, the cost of doing nothing would be even greater. And we cannot do this alone. Only with help of our neighbors, countrymen, and allies throughout the world can we assure that our democratic ideals defeat those of the terrorist extremists. I thank all of them for a job well done.Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.",

Only 26 are rated ineffective in discretionary spending.Chairman Conrad will say the budget resolution cannot tell appropriators how to implement the savings.

    "title": "FAREWELL TO THE SENATE",
    "text": "Mr. President, I would like to now wrap up with a few comments. I have now spent 12 years in the Senate, 18 years in the Congress all together, when you consider the 6 years I served in the House of Representatives. I can say it has been a great experience. In my view, I have represented the best State in the Union. We refer to it as the ``Centennial State'' because it joined the Union exactly 100 years after we became the United States.It has always been enjoyable to talk to my colleagues and talk to visitors to the Capitol about my State of Colorado because they have usually had great experiences when they have visited my State. It is a tourist attraction. We have a lot of things that bring people to Colorado. It is a beautiful State. People have great vacations when they go there, and they are more than anxious to share their wonderful experiences with me, share the wonderful and welcoming attitude they experienced from the people of Colorado, and share with me how much they have enjoyed visiting the great State of Colorado.And, when people get tired of talking about the great State of Colorado, we have always been able to talk about their favorite cat or their favorite dog because, as a veterinarian, it has always been a common interest among many of my colleagues in the Senate, as well as visitors to our office, to talk to me about their favorite pet. So it has been a wonderful experience.This is the greatest legislative body in the world. It is an honor to serve here. There are a lot of dedicated employees who have helped me get things done in this body. They put their own political preferences aside and thought of the well-being of the institution. They have always been very polite and most supportive and helpful. I wish to thank them.I have had great employees in my office. I wish to mention that you get things done because of the people with whom you surround yourself. I have two members who are currently on my staff who have served with me since I was first elected to the Congress. I was elected to the House of Representatives in 1990. They came in with me and worked with me on the House side for 6 years and then they came over here and continued to work in my office for the last 12 years. I appreciate their dedication. Those kinds of people don't come along everyday. They spent 18 years with me, bless their souls. The two I speak of are Sean Conway and Doris Morgan. Both of them have been dedicated staff people who have helped to make my service to the people of Colorado successful.There are also some staffers who joined me after I became a Senator in 1997, in addition to the two I mentioned, including Andy Merritt, who is now my State director; Dick Poole, who is one of my top staff people; Tewana Wilkerson, who has helped me on the Banking Committee; and Kris Hanisch, who has helped us balance our books as well as helping us to move through the maze here in the Senate. We do have our own little bureaucracy in the Senate. She knows it and understands it and has helped us move through it. She has been my office manager and has kept us on the straight and narrow. I appreciate the dedication of all of the employees who have worked with me.I have a great group of employees currently serving me in my office. We have had a number of people who have come and gone, but I never felt it was because they were disappointed in having to work in our office. When I talked to people who came to work as employees in my office, I would say: If your ultimate goal is to work in a Senate office, I want you to rethink your goals. I want you to get an experience here that will help you grow once you leave the Senate, so you can be a better citizen, so you can contribute more fully to whatever path you decide to assume once you leave this great body and leave our office. So I have always tried to encourage them to think about where they want to go. We have had employees who have worked in my office, continued their education, and have become very outstanding. I have a number of former staff people who are actually serving in elected office; I think some five or six people right now who are serving. They decided to go back to Colorado and pursue elected office. I congratulate them, as they are very active citizens in their communities.I wish to mention some of the committee chairmen I have had an opportunity to work with. One of the committees I was successful in getting on was the Budget Committee, with Pete Domenici as chairman, and then Judd Gregg following him, and now we have Senator Kent Conrad. All of these chairmen have been very gracious and helpful in working with me on issues.Then I have had the chance to serve on the Armed Services Committee. Senator John Warner, a great friend, and somebody who is retiring and who has been very helpful, served as the chairman of that committee while I was on the Armed Services Committee.I also served on the Banking Committee. The first chairman I served under was Phil Gramm and then Richard Shelby and now Chris Dodd. I have to say I have been blessed with great leadership on all of those committees.I also served on the Intelligence Committee. I served with Senator Shelby, who was chairman, and Senator Kerrey who was ranking member at the time I served on the Intelligence Committee.Now I serve on a different committee this Congress, the HELP Committee. It deals with health, education, pension and labor issues. My well-known colleague here in the Senate, Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts, is chairman of that committee. He is a wonderful person and someone whom I greatly appreciate and who has spent a lot of time in Colorado, I might say.I also serve with my very good friend who was chairman of that committee for a while, Senator Enzi. I couldn't ask for a better friend. He is from Wyoming, a neighbor of Colorado. So we had many issues in common, and both Joan and I consider Diana and Mike Enzi as our very good friends.I wish to say a few things about those people who are retiring, starting with Senator Pete Domenici, who I mentioned was my chairman on the Budget Committee. I have worked with him also on the Appropriations Committee. I worked with him on energy issues and issues that are common to New Mexico and the State of Colorado. His service here in the Senate has been remarkable and dedicated. The West has been blessed that we have had such a good spokesman as Senator Domenici out there, carrying many of the issues that are important to his neighboring States, as well as New Mexico. The institution will miss him. I am sure New Mexico will miss him. I consider it an honor and a pleasure to have served with him.Senator Warner I mentioned earlier. We couldn't ask for a greater statesman. He has made a number of trips to Colorado. I worked with him on the Defense Authorization bill. He has been more than considerate and helpful to those issues that are important to Colorado. He has been supportive on matters that we worked on for Fort Carson and for Peterson Air Force Base and the Air Force Academy and the many other issues involving the military and military installations we have in Colorado. He has been tough at times, but his leadership has been greatly appreciated by me. I think the Senate and the country have been blessed because Senator Warner has been willing to dedicate so much of his time and effort to making this a better country, a stronger country. He is somebody I am very proud to have been able to serve with.Also retiring is Senator Larry Craig from Idaho, another westerner with whom I found a lot in common. He and I both have strong agricultural roots. He has been a very strong advocate of those issues important to the West and his State of Idaho. Again, I have appreciated working with him on national park issues and public lands issues. He is a superb individual.Another individual I wish to recognize who is retiring is Senator Chuck Hagel from Nebraska; again, one of the neighboring States of Colorado. The State of Nebraska is downstream from Colorado. So we have ribbed each other a little bit about water issues. Basically, though, we have been partners on water issues. We have been able to work together on many issues that have improved the management of water in the Platte River drainage system, which is one of the many rivers that originates in Colorado and flows downstream. I also worked with Senator Hagel on the Banking Committee. He was one who pushed early on for the reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He brought to this institution a great deal of experience. Again, he has decided to retire the same year as I have. I will always remember Senator Chuck Hagel and our relationship and how we have been able to work together, I think for the betterment of both of our States.I would be remiss if I didn't brag about my partner and my wife, Joan Allard. Joan has spent much of her time being with me, whether I have been in Colorado or here in the Senate. Senator Mitch McConnell talked about the town meetings she attended. She attended about as many of those town meetings as I. It has been kind of embarrassing at times because sometimes the number of people who came just to see her in the back of the room was large and they were having more fun back there than I was, up front trying to conduct the meeting. People loved Joan as they got to know her throughout the State of Colorado. Her dedication to me and to her family and the people of Colorado is remarkable and unique. We are known as partners here in the Senate. Wherever I go, Joan is very close by, and people are used to seeing us both at receptions. Many times I was invited to events where they wanted me to come alone. I said: No, I want my wife with me, and if you can't accept my wife, maybe we won't make the reception, because she is somebody who I didn't want to be divorced from this process. She has been willing to make a personal commitment in time and in supporting me in my work. So I wanted to make sure that the responsibilities of serving in the Senate didn't drive a wedge between what a wonderful relationship we have had. She worked side by side with me at the veterinary hospital. We worked and met the challenges of raising two wonderful daughters whom we are very proud of, and now we are seeing grandsons coming up. So I couldn't have asked for a more dedicated wife. We still have a lot ahead of us. I am very pleased that she was willing to take an interest in my job of representing the people of Colorado.The first vote I took in the House and in the Congress was on whether to authorize the first Gulf War in 1991. That was a tough vote. I have now possibly cast my last vote on the economic bailout or the stabilization act we voted on yesterday. So my congressional career has been bookended by hugely significant votes that have humbled me in terms of the trust the people of Colorado have granted. I wish to thank the people of Colorado who have been supportive and who have expressed their views to me in my town meetings, letters, e-mails, faxes, and phone calls. My office has sent out roughly 2.1 million constituent letters since I was sworn in. I say honestly that I relish every opportunity to hear from and explain myself to the people of Colorado. Even those who weren't supportive and who expressed those views in town meetings, letters, e-mails, faxes and phone calls, I thank them for that.I have no regrets and leave this institution with a clear conscience. I feel as though I have been true to my campaign promises and have worked to hold down taxes, hold down spending, hold down the growth of government here in Washington, and I have fought to balance the budget. I feel as though I have worked to defend local control and keep America strong. I have kept in mind private property rights and the power of the State in managing its own water resources.It is time to say goodbye and wish my colleagues the very best, and to wish my successor, whoever that might be, the very best. It is time for Joan and me to move on, hopefully returning to a future in the private sector. I came to Washington with small business experience, and I hope to continue working in the business sector. The challenge, as I see it, is for future Congresses to protect the freedom that continues to create opportunity for us and future generations and to ensure that we have a secure America.May God bless America, and may God bless Congress's future endeavors.I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.",

I rise in support of the Roemer amendment.Tomorrow, my 5-year-old daughter Jacqueline is going to enroll for kindergarten, and when my wife and I look at the cost of paying for an education, we really have our fingers crossed that some day she will earn an athletic scholarship to play lacrosse or soccer or field hockey or some other sport. We are going to need it.The day that her mother started college, there were far fewer opportunities for women to play intercollegiate sports. When her grandmother was growing up, very few women went to college at all. There has been a lot of progress in opportunities for women over the years, and I believe that we should do nothing to turn back the clock on that progress. It is very important that we reaffirm our support for title IX, as I believe this amendment does.I also believe that no one on the other side of this question wants to downgrade women's sports, and I understand that. I believe that we have gotten in an unfortunate box where, somehow or another, we believe that we are choosing between men and women in intercollegiate sports opportunities, and we should not.I happen to believe that the record does show, particularly in the case of some sports like men's wrestling, that there have been some unjustifiable decisions made that have hurt student athletes. And I, for one, am looking for a tool to try and remedy those injustices.With all due respect to its author, who I know is very well-advised and well-intentioned, I do not believe this is the right tool because of the expanded time window that is in it. I do share his conviction, however, that there ought to be some guarantee that before an institution chooses to terminate a sport that it ought to say exactly how much money it is going to save, justify those numbers so that the dynamic of the campus-based, decision-making community can look at that argument and see whether it is true or false.So I will support the Roemer amendment tonight, but I will offer my willingness to cooperate in trying to find a way to resolve this very serious problem.",

Gender discrimination has been institutionalized in American life. It is important that we try to uproot that discrimination from its roots, and what better place to start than the classrooms of America.I am particularly gratified that the authors of this amendment have included in it language that I suggested with respect to a special education program for gender equity that involves the birthplace of women's rights, in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, the Alice Paul Foundation. Alice Paul understood when she wrote the equal rights amendment, which we will yet ratify, and she understood when she led the fight for women's suffrage that discrimination on the basis of gender is rooted in American life.My grandmother was born at a time when women did not have the right to vote. My wife was born at a time when the smartest girl in the class, which she was, was told that she could be a teacher but not the principal, that she could be a nurse but not a doctor. Now, nursing and teaching are honorable professions and if a young woman or young man chooses that profession, we should encourage them to do so, but we should educate them that if they choose to be the doctor or the principal or the President, that they have every right to do so. It is important that young women learn that from the word go.My daughters are 6 and 4. They are being educated in their homes to understand that they can go as far as their abilities will take them. But I understand that in the institutions that they will encounter, they will not necessarily receive the same message. They will be paid 69 cents for every dollar that their brothers earn. They will be told that there are still glass ceilings that apply to them but not their boy cousins or brothers. This must change. The first and best place to change it is in America's classrooms, and the best way to change it today is for us to strongly support the retention of this program.I applaud the authors for introducing it.",

    "title": "APPLAUDING THE RECENT ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE ILLINOIS STATE LEGISLATURE REGARDING THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise before you today in strong support of the recent actions taken by the Illinois state legislature regarding the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), a proposed amendment to the Constitution which would unequivocally guarantee equal gender rights under the law. As many of my colleagues are certainly aware, the Illinois State Assembly recently voted on and passed the ERA, clearing the way for their counterparts in the Senate to consider this crucial legislation at the conclusion of their current recess. If Illinois' State Senate agrees to ratify the ERA, then only two more state ratifications will be necessary for this long overdue amendment to be added to our Constitution.Some people have argued that the addition of an ERA amendment to the Constitution would simply be a change in semantics and nothing more. I strongly disagree. Presently, on average, women receive only 76 percent of the pay that men receive for comparable full time positions. Inequities such as these are inexcusable; they are disastrously damaging not just to women, but also to their families. Through the ratification of an Equal Rights Amendment, women would have an expanded legal basis to call for equal compensation for equal work.Although the Equal Rights Amendment may have faded from the public spotlight at times, the movement to include women in the Constitution never died, and it is growing vigorously once again. Women had to wait until 1920 to be granted the right to vote under the Constitution. While this was certainly a monumental development, it has not produced full gender equality. The 14th Amendment, granting ``equal protection of the laws,'' did not, and still does not, fully protect women from damaging gender discrimination. Only an Equal Rights Amendment would ensure the Constitutionally guaranteed full equality that women deserve.The ERA was originally passed by Congress in 1972, along with a seven-year time limit for ratification. In 1979, Congress extended the time limit for three more years, leaving the deadline at 1982. Within a decade of the initial 1972 passage, the amendment had been ratified by 35 states, three short of the necessary 38. For many years after that, the ERA was, for technical reasons, generally considered ``dead.'' However, legal analyses indicate that with just three more state ratifications, the ERA may in fact meet the requirements to be added to the Constitution. As has been verified by several legal experts, the fact that the time limit appears in the proposing clause rather than the text of the legislation leaves this deadline open to adjustment. When Congress chose to extend the deadline in 1979, a precedent was set; subsequent sessions of Congress may adjust time limits placed in proposing clauses by their predecessors. These adjustments may include extensions of time, reductions, or elimination of the deadline altogether.It is therefore possible for current or future sessions of Congress to eliminate the deadline originally placed on ratification of the ERA, thus allowing the amendment to be added to the Constitution once it is ratified by three more states. This ``three state strategy'' is a very real possibility, and I have introduced legislation into the House of Representatives, H. Res. 38, to ensure that action will be immediately considered by Congress once three more state legislatures ratify the Put simply, it is time for the Constitution to be amended to include an amendment which ensures gender equality for all Americans. Today, unlike some times in the past, the American people are decidedly ready for Constitutionally-guaranteed equal rights for men and women. A July 2001 nationwide survey by Opinion Research Corporation showed that 96 percent of American adults believe that male and female citizens of the U.S. should have equal rights, and 88 percent believe that our Constitution should explicitly guarantee those rights. Having the ERA in the Constitution will simply recognize what the American people already want--equal justice under the law.Many leaders both here in Congress and in state legislatures are advocating for the ``three state strategy,'' as well as a renewal of the ERA by Congress through a second passage of the amendment. I feel that anyone who is serious about guaranteeing equal rights to women should be supportive of both of these approaches. It does not matter how the ERA is eventually made part of the Constitution, as long as guaranteed gender equality rights are the end result.As the Equal Rights Amendment reads, ``Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.'' The ERA is unfinished business for the Constitution. It will be achieved, and present and future generations of women--and men--will thank us for it, and wonder why it took so long. It is simple justice, it is long overdue, and it is time.",

    "title": "COMMENDING CLEMSON UNIVERSITY TIGERS MEN'S GOLF TEAM FOR WINNING 2003 NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION DIVISION I MEN'S GOLF CHAMPIONSHIP",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.I rise in support of this resolution, and I commend and congratulate the gentlemen from South Carolina (Mr. Barrett), (Mr. Spratt), (Mr. Clyburn), (Mr. DeMint), (Mr. Brown), and my friend (Mr. Wilson) for their authorship and sponsorship of this resolution. I can understand why the South Carolina delegation is so justifiably proud of the young men who have achieved so much on the links.Among the very most important classrooms, teaching places in our system of our higher education, is the field of athletic competition. There is a reason why we want to encourage colleges and universities around our country to continue educating young men and women on playing fields; and the achievements of the young men of the Clemson University men's golf team are an example of that principle.I must say parenthetically one of the issues that I am proud of is my alma mater, which did not win the NCAA golf tournament, Bucknell University, was recently noted for graduating 100 percent of its student athletes who participate in NCAA sports, and that is an aspiration that I know is shared around the country.These young men of Clemson and these young Tigers had an extraordinary year amidst extraordinarily difficult competition. I am told that they finished the season with a record of 128 wins, eight losses and three draws, or three ties, against opponents ranked in the top 25 teams in the country. So when they took on the very finest competition there was, they won 93 percent of the matches, which is really an astonishingly good record. I wish that I was right 93 percent of the time in the things that I do here in doing my job.We also want to commend the Oklahoma State University Cowboys who were in second place in the tournament. My understanding is that the tournament took place on their home course, and I think that adds special luster to the achievement of the young men from Clemson because when one is playing against competition that is used to playing on that course day in and day out, it is an advantage for the home team that the Clemson team was able to overcome.It is my understanding that each of the Tigers players who participated in the NCAA championship are native-born South Carolinians. That must be a source of great pride for the schools and the coaches and families of the State of South Carolina for which we congratulate those schools and coaches and families.Finally, it is my understanding that players D.J. Trahan, Jack Ferguson, and Matt Hendrix were all honored as All-Americans in the 2002-2003 season. To have three All-Americans on one team in any sport is quite an achievement; and I know that Head Coach Larry Penley, who himself was honored as the Golf Coaches Association of America's Dave Williams Award winner as Coach of the Year, should be justifiably proud.This morning, as we speak, there are young Americans who are in science labs and lecture halls and technology centers and study areas, all in campuses all around our country, and we commend them for that; but we also recognize that one of the most important places to learn about life and about the principles of life is on the field of battle and athletic competitions. It is obvious Clemson University should be very proud of these young men.I also add one thing parenthetically now to inject a controversial topic for those of us, and I mean those of us on both sides of the aisle who so strongly support title IX and support equal athletic opportunities for young men and women. This is one example of how we do not have to choose between broader opportunities for all athletes and broader opportunities for some. One of the concerns about title IX is that nonrevenue-producing sports on the men's side, like golf, which really does not produce revenue, would be jeopardized if we have a strong and robust title IX. Well, we have a strong and robust title IX. We are pleased we are going to keep this, and I think this is one more example of how we can have men and women excel in the field of athletic competition.So I congratulate Clemson University, and all of their alumni and students and followers must be very, very proud of these young men who have won such an esteemed championship.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.",

For Mr. Malcolm Adler, Principal at George Washington, Ms. Ryan serves as an exemplar through which he instills the values of dedication and service in new teachers.There are no plans for retirement in Ms. Ryan's future. Her continued passion and dedication have recently earned her outstanding evaluations from her supervisor and Principal. Ms. Ryan is also well respected by her colleagues at George Washington who last year voted her ``Teacher of the Year.''Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Ms. Wanda Ryan on her dedicated service to the public school system, the George Washington School, the City of Camden, and the 1st Congressional District of New Jersey.",

This bill is for the woman who runs the office, who makes all the important decisions, without whom the place couldn't function; who one day comes in and discovers that a man, usually a man younger than her, has been brought in and given a higher title, a higher pay, and fewer responsibilities. And she goes to work and says, this isn't fair. I'm doing a job that is actually more important than this other person and getting paid less for it.Now it's true that the statutes presently say you have to get equal pay for equal work. But it's also true that the remedies are so limited under existing law that many women can't get an attorney to represent them in their case so it never gets brought.The best idea in this bill is for the first time it gives robust and full remedies to help that woman so that if she is able to prove her claim that she is underpaid relative to the work that she is doing, she will be fully and fairly compensated, and out of that compensation will come the funds to get her the competent representation that she deserves. The woman who's the office manager who doesn't make as much as the executive vice president for administration.Well, I will tell you, in my life, Mr. Chairman, I benefited from a lot of women who are office managers that don't have fancy titles but without whom institutions could not run. This bill is for that woman and for her daughters so that they do not have the situation where they are devalued, debased, degraded, and disrespected in the workplace.It is long overdue that we vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I would urge colleagues on both sides to do that.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, and I would like to address several of the arguments that we have heard against it, first, that this is some bonanza for trial lawyers.What this is is an opportunity for women who have been discriminated against to get a lawyer. If you work as a sales clerk or in a factory, you can't afford to pay a lawyer the hourly fee that he or she needs to represent you. The only way you are going to get represented is through a contingent fee arrangement where a lawyer would recover, would get to keep part of what you recover as part of the deal.Now, the problem with the Equal Pay Act is its remedies are limited so much to just twice what your salary is that the damages are never high enough to justify legal representation. This is about getting lawyers for people who have a valid claim who cannot afford the thousands of dollars that it would be.Second, there was a representation made that defenses are stripped from employers. That's not accurate. What is accurate is that if an employer alleges that some reason other than gender was the reason that he paid the woman less than the man, it has to be a legitimate reason, like level of education or experience. It has to be a legitimate reason. The present law doesn't require that legitimacy.Finally, the statement was made that an employer cannot discharge an employee for talking about pay scales publicly, that's not accurate. What the law does is to say that it protects employees that are custodians and guardians of pay records. But it certainly doesn't restrict in any way an employer's right to enforce a legitimate and realistic company policy.This is a good bill. It's an excellent proposal that will help lift the economic status of women who work very hard, every day, in some cases 7 days a week, and deserve it.I would urge a ``yes'' vote.",

This is the bill for the women who do the work, make the decisions, shoulder the responsibility but don't get the pay.

This makes the promise of the Equal Pay Act a reality for working women around this country.I'm proud that in the 19 years she's served in this body, the author of this bill has fought for this bill; and I say to her, to you, Mr. Speaker, and Americans all over this country, it will become law because of what we're about to do here today.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Richard E. Murray, FACHE. He has played an integral role in New Jersey's First District through his administration of multiple health care systems. Mr. Murray has demonstrated a history of compassion throughout the community and for this he deserves great praise.Mr. Murray has served as the President/Chief Executive Officer of Kennedy Memorial Health System since 1980. Kennedy Memorial Health System consists of three acute-care hospitals, multiple outpatient clinics and various wellness programs.Mr. Murray's leadership has led to many advances within the Kennedy Memorial Health System. Since 1998, Kennedy Memorial Hospital has opened a free-standing outpatient Dialysis Center, a Sleep Center, a 10-bed Ronald McDonald House Pediatric Unit, a Cancer Center and Outpatient Medical Imaging Center, an Emergency Department, a Center for Wound Healing, a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, a 40-bed Progressive Care Unit, a 12-bed Innovative Hospice Care Center, a Stroke Program, a Maternity Center, a PET/CT Center, a Family Health Services Center, a Maternal-Fetal Medicine Unit, a Surgical Unit, and an Intensive Care Unit.Aside from the structural upgrades, Mr. Murray has overseen multiple projects that have improved the quality of care within the Kennedy Memorial Health System. These projects include the creation of an ``Invensivist Program'' to ensure the oversight of health care providers and patient safety, the purchase of the high-tech DaVinci Robot for use in minimally invasive surgical procedures, and the creation of programs for diabetes control and a smoke free environment at all facilities. Without the hard work and exceptional guidance provided by Mr. Murray, none of these things would have been possible.Mr. Murray has received multiple awards commemorating his service to the South Jersey community. In 2005, he received the New Jersey Hospital Association's Distinguished Service Award, presented annually to an individual with more than 15 years of service in health care who ``consistently demonstrates strength, integrity, professionalism and a relentless commitment to a hospital or health care system.'' In 2006, he was honored by March of Dimes for his positive influence and contribution to the community. In 2007, he was honored with the New Jersey Institute for Nursing EPIC Award, which honors exceptional individuals for their contributions to New Jersey communities and the advancement of health care for the profession of nursing.Madam Speaker, Mr. Murray's service to New Jersey's First Congressional District should not go unrecognized. I want to personally thank Dick Murray for the exceptional guidance he has provided his staff, the community service he has provided to members of the community, and the lives that he has changed throughout New Jersey. I congratulate Mr. Murray and wish him the best of luck in the future.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, there are 15 million unemployed Americans as we meet this afternoon, and this is the 11th consecutive week that the majority has not brought to the floor a bill for us to work together to create an environment where small businesses and entrepreneurs could create jobs for our country.Now, I do agree with the proposition that one of the ways that we could have jobs created by small businesses and entrepreneurs is to improve the country's fiscal standing and give us low long-term interest rates in the long run; and reducing our deficit is a key part of doing that. So I think the issue is not if we reduce spending; it's how we reduce spending.And I do think we should stop sending money to the Brazilian Cotton Institute. I think we shouldn't spend $1.5 billion for the Police Department in Baghdad when American cities are laying police officers off around our country.And I certainly don't think we should be giving $40 billion in subsidies to the oil companies that made $77 billion in profit last year and are raising gasoline to four or five bucks at the pump. I think those are areas we ought to agree on and get this budget done.But 11 consecutive weeks without a bill that helps small businesses and entrepreneurs create jobs is 11 weeks too many.I do, however, Mr. Speaker want to compliment the majority on a good decision I think they've made in this bill. There's an argument in this country about whether to repeal the health care bill or not. We think that would be a surrender to the insurance industry and hurt the American people, and we're against that repeal.And there's an argument in this country about whether Planned Parenthood should continue to get funding for women's health services. Most of us think it should, and many on the other side think it should not.These are legitimate debates. They are not debates that should result in a shutdown of the Federal Government, however. The right thing to do is to agree on the budget and then agree to disagree on repealing the health care bill and funding for Planned Parenthood later down the road.And I would commend the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the chairman of the Rules Committee for putting on the floor this afternoon an extension that does not defund the health care bill, that leaves it in place, and an extension that does not defund Planned Parenthood, that leaves the funding for that in place.I think that's the result that we should have in the long run. I think the budget that we adopt between now and September 30 should continue to fund the health care bill, as this bill does, and should continue to fund Planned Parenthood, as this bill does.But I commend the majority for its decision to leave those issues out of this bill so that these issues are not wrapped up in this.",

    "text": "I thank my friend for yielding.Mr. Speaker, I want to agree with the gentlelady from Illinois who just spoke, who said what the American people want is jobs. I agree with her. And when we assess the record of the new majority on this issue, I think we have to assess that it's found very wanting.This is the 10th week of the new majority. In 10 weeks, they found a way to shut down women's health clinics by defunding Planned Parenthood. They've found a way to essentially repeal 30 years' worth of protections for our drinking water and our air and our land. They've found a way to pass a budget that cuts education, that saps strength and energy from our job creators in this country, but they haven't found one bill, 1 minute, one debate over a plan to work together to create jobs for the American people.I believe, Mr. Speaker, that the American people want Republicans and Democrats to come together and figure out an environment that will encourage entrepreneurs and small businesses to create jobs for our country. The majority has, frankly, done everything but that. And today is yet another bill that I think is a wasted opportunity in that regard.I view today's debate through the eyes of three constituents I interacted with at home this weekend. One was a gentleman who runs a music distribution company. They produce CDs for people who have written and recorded music and don't have a label yet so they can get their music out to the rest of the world. He employs 500 people, and he wants to grow. And in order to grow, he needs people who are facile with various software and other technologies that will help his company grow. He depends upon graduates from our community colleges and our 4-year colleges and universities. And he didn't understand why the majority wants to cut the maximum college scholarship under Pell Grants by $845, thereby taking employees away, conceivably, from him by taking them out of school.It's the homebuilder that I met who really can't call himself a homebuilder anymore because he's not building any homes, and he wonders what we're doing to try to restore faith and confidence to the real estate market so that Americans will feel secure and confident enough to buy a home and put him and his workers back to work. He wonders what we're doing.It was the gentleman I met yesterday who runs a biotech company that has two employees, and he depends on contracts from the National Institutes of Health to do research on various pharmaceutical products. He wants to double the size of his company, put just two more people to work, but he won't hire them as long as the threat of a government shutdown is imminent.This is the wrong bill at the wrong time on the floor.",

    "text": "Madam Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Mink/Woolsey/Sanchez/Morella amendment which restores current gender equity provisions to ensure that girls succeed in school. We need to support gender equity and diversity through all levels of education. For decades, title I has included essential programs to address the gender gap in education. Now arguments have been made that gender inequities no longer warrant our attention. While it is true that girls have made some improvements, the statistics show there are still major gaps in areas such as technology.In our fast-paced global economy, it is essential that girls receive the technology skills to compete successfully.Another continuing problem is inequitable teaching. In 1998, an American Association of University Women report showed that gender inequities still persist in teacher practices. While in most cases teacher biases are unintentional, we need to develop and implement strategies to prevent classroom gender biases. These and other examples show why we must continue to address the need for gender equity in education. We should make this good bipartisan bill better and adopt the Mink amendment.First, this amendment includes provisions to keep pregnant and parenting teenagers in schools. This is one of the most common reasons girls give for dropping out of high school. We should not and cannot turn our back on those who are at risk.Second, the amendment continues to encourage title I schools to meet the educational needs of underserved populations, including girls.Schools should develop strategies to treat boys and girls fairly in the classroom and to encourage girls to pursue higher degrees and careers in math, science, and technology.Finally, this amendment would reauthorize the Women's Educational Equity Act, WEEA, which was enacted in 1974 under the leadership of the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink), to help schools and teachers meet the title IX requirements that prohibit sex discrimination in educational programs that receive Federal funding. WEEA provides resources for teachers and schools seeking equitable education models and methods. Girls all over this country have realized the success of WEEA and other currently working programs; and given the current continuing evidence of the need, we must reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that girls have choices in the future that are not limited by gender; and therefore I urge my colleagues to adopt the Mink/Woolsey/Sanchez/Morella amendment.",

I would like, in addition, to cite the work of the staff with regard to this and other bills, Mr. Speaker. It is outstanding work always.Mr. Speaker, the remarks of the gentleman from New Jersey are such that I think they make a compelling case in and of themselves. I would like not to reiterate them but to amplify them somewhat.The temporary moratorium on the entry of large fishing vessels into these two fisheries will provide the East Coast councils the opportunity they need to develop management plans to protect the resources without the threat of overcapitalization. I think that the gentleman from New Jersey has made a clear and compelling case in that regard.Too many fisheries in the United States are already overcapitalized, and seasons that used to last for months are now over in days. In New England, coastal communities have been devastated by the crash of cod and haddock stocks. Mackerel and herring will be the only healthy fisheries if they can survive the next several years, but not if those stocks are suddenly being harvested by an influx of large vessels. Four or five of these boats could eliminate the opportunities for fishermen that have little else to depend upon.It is time that we learn from the mistakes of the past and encourage the proactive approach by the councils to the problems of overcapitalization. This bill does that by giving the councils the time to do their job. It will be good for the fishing industry and the fish, and I urge Members to support the bill.Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maine [Mr. Allen].",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I was privileged to be on the floor of the House of Representatives when the President's budget passed in 1993, that budget at the time denounced so severely by many critics of the President and what he was trying to accomplish.I think, some 5 years later, we found that all of the goals have been in fact accomplished with respect to balancing the budget; and, most particularly, we find ourselves in a situation with low interest rates and the ability of people to take advantage of the home interest deduction they might not otherwise have had.As a result, Mr. Speaker, I hope there is a recognition that this was the right course to take, that the American people have been the beneficiaries, that home ownership has been advanced, and that these 5 years provide a record of accomplishment of which we can all be proud.Mr. Speaker, Today, many if not every Member of Congress is going to receive a visit by realtors from our districts.I look forward to meeting today with the members of the Hawaii Association of Realtors on their annual trip to Washington.I know one of their top priorities is preserving the home mortgage interest deduction. I stand with them completely on this issue.As the House moves closer to developing a tax bill in the months ahead, it is vitally important that we preserve the mortgage interest deduction. It is fundamental of fulfilling the American dream of home ownership. I am concerned that proposals for a flat tax or a national sales tax would endanger the mortgage interest deduction.The mortgage interest deduction in important to Hawaii, where the average cost of a single family home is $312,000.It is estimated that eliminating the mortgage interest deduction could cause the value of existing homes to drop between 20-30 percent.As we in Hawaii face our greatest economic challenge since statehood, elimination of the mortgage interest deduction would be a disaster.Homeowners would suffer a disastrous loss of equity. Thousands of realtors, construction workers, and employees of financial institutions would lose their livelihoods.Mr. Speaker, I urge may colleagues to join me in fighting any attempt to eliminate the home mortgage deduction.",

I made an appeal for fairness. I thought that a vote on censure was something that would have given balance to the debate.Since that time, and during that time, rather, I made an appeal to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), the chairman, on the basis of not just only personal friendship but on the basis of what he has represented to me and to other Members in the House.We have heard accusations that the rule of law would be compromised even to the point of perhaps recreating circumstances of the Holocaust. I do not think anybody really meant that anyone opposed to impeachment intended that kind of thing, but that is how this thing has begun to run away.Another Member who was for impeachment indicated that those of us who supported the President had engaged in an obscenity in going to the White House afterwards to show our support. If such a thing had been said on the floor, we would have taken down that Member's words because it would have meant that we were personally being attacked and accused, our character at point. So I ask again today for fairness. I ask that we turn down this motion on the managers so that we can get the opportunity to vote on a censure.I understand that Members who voted for impeachment have now asked the Senate to censure, and so I think that is only the fair way. I appeal to the chairman and to Members who voted for impeachment, give us this opportunity for fairness. Give us an opportunity to vote on censure.",

There is a waiver in existence now with respect to the use of the facilities so perhaps we do not find anybody in violation, inadvertently or otherwise. Perhaps this is an issue, although I realize the gentleman is not in the position of advocating the bill this evening.There should be an opportunity for us to discuss this, then, in committee. I am sure we could take up the pros and cons and maybe talk it out a little bit, and perhaps another solution could be arrived at.But I have to stand, then, with my original reluctance and at the same time say that even after this colloquy I find myself still in opposition, not necessarily to doing it or finding some other solution, but at this particular time, pending hearings in the House Committee on Armed Services, I ask that it be defeated for the time being, at least.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I would like to echo the comments of the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett) with respect to this resolution.Mr. Speaker, I join in support of the resolution introduced by my colleague, Mr. Metcalf, in expressing the appreciation of the United States to those who were aboard the British transport H.M.T. Rohna during World War II.According to the limited data available, the H.M.T. Rohna was transporting American troops and Red Cross workers to Bombay, India, for the China-Burma-India Theater of war. On November 26, 1943, during an air attack, a German bomber launched a guided missile, which sunk the British transport. One thousand, one hundred and thirty eight individuals died as a result of the attack, including one thousand and fifteen American troops. The attack of the H.M.T. Rohna was one of the greatest losses of lives during World War II.Much of the details surrounding the sinking of the H.M.T. Rohna are still unavailable. What is known is that more than nine hundred service members survived the attack, because of the brave and heroic actions of the U.S.S. Pioneer crew, who rescued many of the survivors. However, it was not until 1995, over fifty years later, a group of survivors, next-of-kin, and rescuers, came together to recognize this historical tragedy.The resolution before the House today recognizes this devastating disaster and expresses the appreciation of the Congress to the service members who died in the sinking of the H.M.T. Rohna for their ultimate sacrifice in defense of our country, expresses admiration of the survivors and the families for their bravery and courage in brining attention to this catastrophe, and acknowledges the efforts of the United States, British and French rescuers, especially the crew of the U.S.S. Pioneer, to save the passengers and crew of the H.M.T. Rohna.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me to be on the floor with the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Metcalf) this evening in recognition of his work in this area.I want to express to him that it does not surprise me in the least, having gotten to know him over the past few years, that he is concentrating on making sure that those who had not been recognized are given the attention that they deserve.I think it expresses the kind of person that the gentleman from Washington is, and I, for one, will miss the contributions that he has made, and I am sure will continue to make to this Nation and to his community.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett) has provided the background, and I suspect there will be some further commentary by the introducer of the bill.Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3621, introduced by Mr. Doug Bereuter, which would provide for the posthumous promotion of William Clark to the grade of captain in the Regular Army.William Clark was the coleader with Meriwether Lewis of the ``Corps of Discovery'', a military and scientific expedition to the Pacific Northwest from 1804 to 1806. This expedition provided vast information on the resources of the West and encouraged further exploration and settlement.In 1792, William Clark became an officer in the regular army and fought in the battle of Fallen Timbers. In 1803, Clark accepted an invitation to serve as coleader of the ``Corps of Discovery''. He spent several months studying astronomy and map-making, and traveled with Meriwether Lewis down the Ohio River to Wood River, Illinois, where they made the final preparations for their expedition across America.Upon his return from the expedition, William Clark continued his outstanding service to this nation. In 1807, President Thomas Jefferson appointed him principal Indian Agent for the Louisiana Territory and brigadier general of its militia, which he held until 1813, when he became governor of the newly formed Missouri Territory.As we begin celebrations recognizing the 200th anniversary of the Corps of Discovery, it is fitting that we acknowledge the contributions of William Clark and provide him with a posthumous promotion to Captain.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

The estimated 4,200,000 acres of U.S. coral reef resources in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) are at high risk and in dire need of enhanced protection, research and management. This bill creates a much needed comprehensive mechanism to protect the Nation's coral reefs, as well as support the activities of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force and other stakeholders. Coral reefs truly are the ``rainforests of the oceans.'' There have been many concerted efforts by the Administration, Congress, states, and local communities to protect and safely manage corals. Since the Coral Reef Task Force released its National Action Plan in March, Federal, state, territorial, and local partners have moved forward to improve our protection of these valuable and fragile areas through effective stewardship of coral reefs. This bill would provide needed authorization for coral conservation project funding and enhance needed partnerships to protect reefs. Designing an effective bill has taken ten long years, and I am pleased to see the efforts of Chairman Young, Mr. Miller, Mr. Saxton, Mr. Faleomavaega, and our Senate colleagues paying off in such grand fashion for a true success for our environment and marine resources.",

    "title": "GORO HOKAMA POST OFFICE BUILDING",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I want to particularly thank the chairman today for the opportunity to be here. Mr. Speaker, it is probably something that many of us tend to take for granted over time, that we have the opportunity to be on this floor and to sponsor bills such as the Goro Hokama Post Office Building bill, and in some respects could be seen by others as pro forma. I think, Mr. Speaker, we have learned, and I am sure the chairman has learned, that it is the obvious that we have to repeat to ourselves over and over again, because it is the obvious that sometimes we take most for granted and forget first. This, perhaps, Mr. Speaker, is one of those occasions, where we remind ourselves that we really, in fact, do have the high honor and privilege of serving the people of this Nation.While the issues may be weighty in many respects and a somber and sober attitude required with respect to the adjudication of these issues and the resolution of these issues, today I can tell my colleagues, this is an occasion of joy for the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink) and myself, and I hope, by extension in some small way, for the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Gibbons) as presiding officer, and for the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) today, to be here because we have, in fact, the opportunity to recognize, as my colleague indicated, a public servant, someone who has seen himself always as the humble servant of the people of Hawaii and, most particularly, the people of Lanai.As the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink) indicated, the island of Lanai is a small island; small in population, small in size, known the world over as the Pineapple Island, and Goro Hokama is central to the history of this island, not only from the time that he spent as a young man before his service in the United States Army, but almost literally upon the time that he returned from the service to Lanai to take up his duties as a member of the ILWU in representing the working people of the island of Lanai. He was elected to public office. The people who knew him best, who knew him from the time he was a little boy, understood that in Goro Hokama, they had someone of extraordinary ability. That ability and insight, I might add, Mr. Speaker, was such that he encouraged people. He encouraged people to participate in the public life of Hawaii, and with statehood 41 years ago, the experience that he had with the county, the experience he had with my good and dear friend, the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink), and in encouraging her, and this is not always possible. It is something we take for granted now, Mr. Speaker.It was not easy to be a member of a minority. It was not easy to be seen as someone who did not have control of the levers of power, to be able to continue to succeed, to encourage others, to participate in a way that gave others confidence in him, and Goro Hokama was the person who did that. Goro Hokama was someone who encouraged the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink) to pursue her political career which has manifested itself in the marvelous record that she has here in the United States Congress. Goro Hokama was someone that encouraged a young kid from the east coast of the United States who had come all the way to Hawaii in the hopes of beginning another life with statehood as I did 41 years ago, not only encouraged me, but gave me the idea that it was what I had to contribute that counted. It was what was in my heart that counted. And when we have a man like Goro Hokama as a guiding light, as a mentor, as someone who can make clear the path for you, encouraging you all the way, it is something that is truly to be treasured.So my colleague and I come to the floor today with a sense that with the naming of the Goro Hokama Post Office Building, there is a conclusion to a life of public service, and I hope that his grandsons, Jordan and Trent, possibly are up at 5 o'clock in the morning, too, to see their grandfather honored.So, Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude my remarks by again thanking the chairman, not only for his consideration, but for giving us the opportunity to honor someone who truly deserves it, a great American, a great son of Hawaii, a true representative of everything that is great and good about the island of Lanai, Goro Hokama.",

You notice how lonely he is over there. Notice how people are not rushing down here to defend this position.Now we can understand that. We are all legislators here. But let us go over what is taking place here. There is a victory for the forces that attacked us if we are able to be divided this way.I am here to state that this is politics. We need to vote this amendment for the reason that these folks brought up over here and that they are valiantly defending over here.Supplementals. If we can handle it by supplementals, and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh) is reduced to the position of saying, look, we are not trying to hurt anybody else, even though that is what the result is going to be. Let us do it by supplemental. Let us deal with that because the revenues are going down all over the country, and it does not matter whether you are Republican or you are a Democrat. But I will state this, if this Miller amendment fails, it will be a bell ringer in the arguments that are going to be made in the next fall in the elections. And some of the people that have been supporting folks on the other side of the aisle, believe me, are going to find themselves in a very difficult political position. And that position will be how is it possible that a promise could be made that all of us are supposed to pull together, Democrat and Republican, but we are hurting the very people at the grassroots that are supporting this war effort.These are unemployed. I am taking this from the preliminary monthly report of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And the people of New York are going to get hurt in the sense that they get $60 million, but the people in New Jersey or Hawaii, my people, and I note in passing December 7 was brought up here. I ought to know about that. And we dealt with that with supplementals. How is it possible for us to attack the unemployed in order to pay for a political strategy over here with respect to the supplemental budget that we are supposed to put forward, the stimulus?How is it possible that we could attack our own people? We are eviscerating ourselves. We are devouring ourselves in order to get behind a political strategy that is going to be a loser for my colleagues. I guarantee my colleagues this, there is not a person on that side of the aisle that supports the position of trying to defeat the Miller amendment that could stand up to anybody in any neighborhood board meeting, in any community meeting and defend that position.Let us vote for the Miller amendment if my colleagues want to be here next year and they want to be here defending the interests of the American people rather than the interests of American corporations that are trying to take advantage of us.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.Mr. Speaker, my remarks today are of a personal nature because I expect that the relationship that most of us have to Lionel Hampton is in fact personal.I recall very clearly I think almost the first moment that I became aware of what was in fact America's contribution to the music of the world, jazz, when I inadvertently one afternoon was at a friend's house, and, completely without knowledge of what exactly I was doing, I had recently taken up the trumpet, and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) is laughing at the moment because he knows when I say ``taken up the trumpet,'' I had just picked it up, because I was not able to do much more than that. I was a living example of ambition over technique and talent, and I can see that that relates then to a lot of Members here.But what had happened was I saw something that said ``Carnegie Hall Concert, 1938, Benny Goodman Orchestra,'' and I had no idea at that time as a little boy what that might involve.For those who are familiar with it, this was the concert that was made almost as an afterthought, with a single overhead microphone, tape that was in Benny Goodman's closet for many years, finally found it, and that was when the quartet that the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) cited, the first integrated quartet, not integrated in terms of musicians, integrated in terms of America's true voice of jazz, with white and black musicians, had been gathered together, with Teddy Wilson on piano and Gene Kruppa on drums, and, of course, Benny Goodman playing the lead in the quartet on clarinet and Lionel Hampton on the vibes.When I heard that quartet playing, I had never heard anything like it in my life. It is so vivid in my mind, even now as I am speaking. And it is an emotional experience, because we have certain transcendent moments in our lives, and that was not just one of them, but perhaps one that most formed the world for me, a world view at the time, as to what was possible. The excitement of it, the vitality of it, the vividness of the playing, the exuberance, it was everything and anything that could be expected and hoped for in American music and, by extension then, our gift, as I said before, to the world.Lionel Hampton was a particularly meaningful part of that, because, along with Gene Kruppa on the drums, I do not think you can find, except perhaps in the hero of both of them, Louis Armstrong, anyone in jazz more enthusiastic, more full of life, more expressive of the innate vitality of jazz, than Gene Kruppa and Lionel Hampton playing together; and that excited me as a young boy. It motivated me in trying to do the best I could with that trumpet, becoming involved in a jazz band in high school; and I cannot think, as I look back and I try to recall in my life to this point, of a single minute, a single moment, when I was not happy playing music, that it did not give me a sense of self that was always by definition optimistic, I can tell my colleagues, if they ever heard me play.I had a great tone, though. That was the thing. If only Hampton heard it, he would have said, kid, you got a great tone; too bad you missed out on the talent part. I cannot think of a single moment when I was not happy, not because I had any ambition to play the way that Hampton and Krupa and Goodman and Wilson played, but that that was my way of sharing with them the creative instinct that is in all of us and which had been freed in all of us by Lionel Hampton and all of the pioneers of jazz in this country.It is fitting, of course, that we celebrate this today because Lionel Hampton is, of course, approaching almost a century. He has achieved iconic status, and for good reason, because that talent and that liveliness and that exuberance for life and for his music has been carried over into every venue in which he has exposed himself to the American public and, in fact, the world. If there is anything that characterizes Lionel Hampton, and for those who have not had the opportunity to see him in person, to listen to him in person, they have missed out on one of the greatest experiences of life. There is no one in music, there is no one in life that exudes more of the core of creativity and what it means to be a human being in terms of that creativity than Lionel Hampton.I want to conclude, Mr. Speaker, by saying that we, as a species, differentiate ourselves from all of the other species on the earth by our ability to reflect and our ability to imagine. As I reflect on this life force called Lionel Hampton, and as I reflect on the capacity to create that he exemplifies, I can think of no greater example of what it means to be a good and true human being and creative person, a life force of which we can all be proud to have known musically and to be able to honor today.Mr. OTTER: Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

He enlisted in the Army in World War 1, attained a commission after the war, and served as Provost Marshal of the Army's Hawaiian Department during World War II. Having responsibility for enforcing martial law in Hawaii, he is widely credited with a human touch and sense of fairness during that difficult time.Having been commissioned an honorary major general in the Association of Washington Generals, Frank Steer is eminently qualified for honorary promotion to provost marshal of the United States Army and United States Air Force, and I am delighted to extend such recognition to him.Frank Steer is one of Hawaii's living treasures. He is part of our island history and played a major role in making our state a unique and special place. I join Frank Steer's legion of friends and admirers in congratulating him on a life well lived and for his unparalleled service to our nation.",

    "title": "LEGISLATION TO AUTHORIZE CERTAIN BUREAU OF RECLAMATION ACTIVITIES",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today, Representative Ed Case and I are introducing legislation to authorize certain Bureau of Reclamation activities that will have profound impacts on the future of Hawaii's economy.The legislation is a companion bill to one introduced in the Senate by Senator Daniel Akaka and Senator Dan Inouye. It will expand the scope of the Bureau of Reclamation water resources study authorized by the 105th Congress as well as authorize three specific projects needed to address Hawaii water needs. This law, the Hawaii Water Resources Act of 2000, included Hawaii in the Bureau's wastewater reclamation program and expanded its drought relief programs to include Hawaii.Although one of Hawaii's greatest assets is its tropical climate, there are vast areas where little rainfall occurs and conditions are very similar to that of the high arid regions of the mainland U.S. In addition, similar to current conditions in these U.S. areas, drought conditions have been occurring in most recent years.The most recent projection of the Honolulu Board of Water Supply indicates that the island of Oahu will exhaust the fresh water supplies of the island by the year 2018. Seventy-two percent of Hawaii's population lives on Oahu, so it is easy to imagine the cataclysmic consequences of ignoring the dire warnings that are being sounded. There are numerous efforts underway at both the State and local levels to begin addressing problems, such as substituting recycled water for potable water when appropriate, improving storage to preserve surface water, and implementing conservation technologies.Enactment of the legislation will help lead us to long-term solutions. There are, however, several projects ready for implementation that would begin to mitigate current and future conditions. Three of them would be authorized under the bill. Briefly, a desalinization facility would be built on Oahu, capable of producing 5 million gallons of potable water a day. Secondly, on the leeward side of the Big Island of Hawaii, a facility is to be built creating subsurface wetlands and an open surface wetland to treat effluent and generate useable water. The third project, in Lahaina, Maui, is to expand the existing recycled water distribution system so that numerous commercial users can substitute readily available recycled water appropriately where currently potable water is used.I look forward to working with my colleagues to help find solutions to water development, conservation, reuse and recycling in Hawaii.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much.In conjunction with the comments that the gentleman and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) have been making, I want to preface my remarks with the observation that part of the complaint that is being made across the country with respect to this attack on Iraq and the subsequent war which is now unfolding is that where are people speaking out on it?Well, we are here on Special Orders tonight. I think those who are observing our deliberations here on C-SPAN understand that the House is not formally meeting right now. I would think, I want to make it clear to those folks who are observing and listening to our deliberations here this evening, that we do not have the opportunity during the work day to be able to speak at length and in depth on this issue and the issues surrounding the attack on Iraq. We have the opportunities to ask questions and perhaps a followup or two in committee hearings, when we are able to get them, with respect to the defense budget or as we dealt with just recently having witnesses from the Department of Defense. Those are rather formal occasions, as they should be. Presentation is made by the Department of Defense or by the requisite executive agency, and so occasionally a dialogue back and forth.If C-SPAN is not there, for all intents and purposes, it does not exist. When we go home to our districts and they say, where are the people who are opposed to this or have differing views or want to establish a different perspective, it is important to understand that the mass media in this country is owned by a small number of conglomerate interests, many of whom are associated with the kind of thing that is taking place just today.I refer you to the Los Angeles Times, Monday, June 23, the business section: California firms lining up to capitalize on rebuilding of Iraq. Hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars involved in this opportunity. If you think for a moment that the national media is going to be covering the Special Orders, do you think we are going to appear even on ``Nightline,'' which is probably the most objective and the most far-reaching of those who want to get the news out, I think we are dreaming.Now, I look up right now and the galleries are right in front of us. For those of you who are across the country who are observing us and listening to us tonight, the galleries are empty. I suppose the news organizations might have to pay overtime, I am not sure, but there are no reporters volunteering their time because they are interested in what it is that we have to say.Now, I have come back from a trip with a congressional delegation, the first congressional delegation to get into Iraq, to go to Bagdad, to go to Kirkuk in the north, a bipartisan delegation; and I am referring to the gentleman from Pennsylvania's (Mr. Hoeffel) admonition and to the gentleman from Massachusetts' (Mr. Delahunt) suggestion about an independent commission to examine these issues, a nonpolitical review, if I remember what you said.",

If anything should reflect the concern of the administration with regard to the issues of resolving the consequences of our attack in Iraq, it should be contained in here.I have, for my colleagues' information, Mr. Speaker, referring to the House Action Reports, a Congressional Quarterly publication, a fact sheet edition published today on defense appropriations. In it, section 3 addresses military personnel. It includes things like a military pay raise and a civilian Defense Department pay raise. Active Duty personnel are listed at 1,388,100 in fiscal year 2004, equal to the President's request of 1,600 less than the current level. On Reserves, the bill sets a ceiling on Reserve personnel for a total of 863,300 in the next fiscal year, equal to the administration's request of 1,258 less than the 2003 level.Now, think about it. We now have 150,000 plus people committed in Iraq under the circumstances and conditions that have been discussed here tonight, personnel deployed throughout the world, not just in Afghanistan, but the Philippines, Yemen, and dozens of places, now possibly in Liberia, again under circumstances that are not clear as to where we are going, what we are doing, and who we are doing it with.The President says, ``Bring 'em on,'' but here is the congressional responsibility and obligation as manifested in the appropriations which follow on our authorizing personnel. And what we are saying is, is that the same deployments that have been taking place up until now, which have put such an enormous strain on the Guard and Reserves are going to continue. We are not adding a single person. We are not facing with any respect whatsoever the realities of what these deployments and the obligations attendant upon them will require of us.That is why we are here in the evening during these Special Orders trying to reach out to the American public to explain that we are not quiescent on this. We are not merely observers. We are trying to participate in a respectful and responsible way as Members of Congress. But we have to rouse the attention of the American people to let them know that we are failing those men and women in the armed services if we think for a moment that we are providing adequate support and foundation for what we expect of them.",

And the questions from the press, the press which is absent, which do not appear, at least as far as I can tell; now, whether or not people in the White House are so covetous of being in the White House that they do not dare ask the question that anybody with any journalistic bent worthy of the name would ask, just who is supposed to replace Mr. Taylor when he does go, wherever you think he should, provided you have got that far?Mr. Speaker, the reason I raise this issue and the reason I raise it in the present context is if you think we had no planning in Iraq, I can tell you now and tell the American people and tell my colleagues we do not have a clue or an idea of what we will do in Liberia in terms of who will replace Mr. Taylor and who will prevail when he leaves.Now, are we to send in not tens of thousands of, but perhaps hundreds of, American soldiers into a situation that we do not have the slightest idea, nor has there been any discussion in the Congress about what we are going to do, how, when or why we are going to do it, and what the circumstances will be upon the action taken.Now, I for one admonish all of us to take into account where we are now in Iraq and remember that we face exactly the same circumstances in terms of lack of forward-planning policy with regard to Liberia, and the consequences could be just as severe. The numbers might be different, but the situation is the same. We have an administration now that thinks that military action in and of itself constitutes political policy. Furthermore, support for the troops is then defined as being support for whatever political agenda they have. Now, that is what we are facing this evening.No one can say if only for the fact that we appear here on the floor tonight that due warning has not been given to the American public by Members serving in the Congress of the United States that we should have a full debate with respect to what we are going to do in Liberia, most particularly in the wake of what is taking place in Iraq, and that before any action is taken in Liberia, the will of the Congress has to be determined.I would hope that we take the most serious and sober view before we commit American troops in furtherance of a political agenda, and that political agenda is made manifest for the world to judge on the basis of action by American troops.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel) have asked some questions not just for rhetorical effect, but which throw some light on some very interesting aspects of this whole dilemma, which the Secretary of Defense says is over with, which the National Security Adviser says we have to move on from. I am asking why. Who committed these forgeries? I keep hearing about it. I keep asking the questions. We cannot get anybody in front of us to answer the questions. Who committed these forgeries? The word ``forgery,'' the phrase is used all the time; but there does not seem to be the slightest inclination to find out what was at stake. Did they appear by spontaneous combustion? Was this an immaculate conception of forgery? I do not think so. There were reasons for it.Now we see the aspect of the Sunday talk shows. They are very interesting these days. Turn off the sound and watch the eyes and the expressions of the people who are speaking. Just watch that. Get the body language down, and Members will see the tension that is there because they do not want to answer the question who benefited from having this kind of an observation in that speech by the President. It has nothing to do with 16 words or a single sentence. It has everything to do with the reasons behind that being recommended to the President.This is not an accusation against the President. We are not going to determine that down here tonight as to what the President did or did not do with respect to that speech. The President is having a difficult enough time as it is other than to say it was somebody else's fault. That is something that we can take up with the President when it comes to election time, but that is not the issue here.The issue here is who and what was behind the insistence that that sentence and that that observation go into that speech. I think the answer is out there. I think what is involved in that answer has to do with who benefited from it. Mr. DELAHUNT. Mr. Speaker, I think it is absolutely essential that the American people receive the answers to that question and to all the other questions that have been offered. Earlier this evening the gentleman from the other side of the aisle mentioned the talk shows and the statements that are being made have a political context to them.We have been here, as the gentleman well knows, for 5 weeks posing these questions. This is not motivated by Democratic intent to secure political advantage. If we did not do this, we would be abrogating our responsibility within our system to find the truth. It is about a search for the truth, and I dare say it is now time for the President of the United States and Congress to come together to create an independent commission, not one that has partisan overtones, but one, for example, that served this country well under the leadership of two former Senators, a Republican from New Hampshire, Warren Rudman, and a Democratic from Colorado, Gary Hart, who I think made an extraordinary contribution by a year's worth of hearings, even more, which ended up with a product that tragically predicted what occurred on September 11. We need that because I do not want to hear on this floor accusations about partisanship. This is about the future of America. That is what this is about. This ought not be about politics. Let us depoliticize that now and let the Republican and the Democratic leadership with the White House create an independent commission to reveal to the American people the truth.",

The press galleries, I will say again, are empty here this evening. We cannot have anybody from these big networks that are trying to make sure that they do not cross the Federal Communications Commission. They all want to be able to consolidate even more, own even more of what message gets out there. The press is not covering the outrage that is taking place across this country with respect to the points that the gentleman from Illinois is raising. If my colleagues will go to moveon.org, we will find that there are over 300,000 people right now across this country who have indicated that they want an independent commission to look into all the questions, all the inquiry that is being raised in these sessions that we are having in this Iraq Watch, 300,000 people and growing. That does not get the coverage. It is the kind of grassroots movement, the net-roots if you will, that is taking place all across this country, that says we are not going to take it, our democracy is not going to be taken away from us by some self-appointed elitists who have an anti-imperialist attitude about what the United States is going to be or not be and that we are going to be informed about it later and that the sons and daughters of those elitists will never have to pay the price in blood and treasure that it takes to impose that imperialist vision on the world. I will tell my colleagues that all across this country men and women are realizing they do not have to take it. They can do something about it. They are letting us know about it. Our colleagues have been reading on the floor of this House in some of the shorter special sessions message letters. They are reading communications that are coming in from the moveon.org petition drive from all over the country, in every State, in every nook and corner of this country, people who do not want to be lied to. You can fool people. There is no doubt you can fool people, but you cannot keep it up and you cannot get away with it forever. People do not mind facing up to hard truths. Like Ronald Reagan said, facts are stubborn things. People do not mind facing up to it. They do not want to be lied to, they do not want to be finessed, they do not want to be fooled, and they do not want to be played with; and we need to bring this truth forward, and that is why we better have this commission or let me tell my colleagues, this administration and the elitists that support it are going to pay a fearful price.",

They came in. We drove in. We came down that long road from the airport into Baghdad. The last delegation that just went had to be flown from the airport into the compound where Mr. Bremer is and where the troops are because they cannot go on that road any more. I remember coming in this road. I said, We are going to have to have 10,000 troops just to guard the road in from the Baghdad airport because you have the road and you have desert and that means you can come in. Remember, I called upon Thomas Edwards Lawrence, T.E. Lawrence, where is your spirit? Where are you now that we need you? Because you cannot guard that road. All it takes is a cell phone and a trigger mechanism to be able to attack these vehicles.So when you talk $66 billion or however you want to break this down, and I hope that we are going to break this down before we vote any money for this, we have to take into account you will need thousands and thousands of troops, longer and longer time at greater expense than even has been mentioned here tonight just to guard the road.",

That has to be applied and dissected, and so I think that it is important for us to continue to meet, to continue to urge the media to do more than simply take press releases and speeches at face value and to perhaps follow a little bit more analytically what is taking place and most certainly for all of us to stand up and make sure that everyone in this country understands that political agendas and support from the troops and for the troops are two different things.I do not think anybody recognizes the full degree of anger that is building in this country as a result of trying to confuse those two points.",

Well, help is on the way. My understanding is that the Turkish Parliament has voted to send troops to Iraq. Why, that is wonderful. We are going to have assistance at long last.There is only one little problem and perhaps Condoleezza Rice can stabilize this while she is at it. The Iraqi Governing Council, our governing council, our appointees, the people we have chosen as the foundation of stabilization, political stabilization in Iraq do not want them. They told them to stay out. These people, ungrateful wretches that they are, apparently have a sense of suspicion that the Turks might have more than one agenda in mind. That if they cross over into Iraq, that perhaps the Turks might have something to do with what benefits Turkey.Now, where would they get that idea? Does the phrase Ottoman Empire ring a bell with anybody? It is all history that has been lost. The Iraqis have had some experience with Turkish soldiers before. I keep calling on the ghost of T.E. Lawrence. Where are you when we need you?I understand they show movies down at the White House. Maybe they ought to get Lawrence of Arabia and get that down there and show it to them.Wake up. Help is not on the way. Three more dead today, others injured. The media is reduced to saying, but nobody has been killed since last Friday. This is the kind of marginal gain, apparently, that we are making. This is the kind of measurement that is taking place now. The news hour in the evening on PBS, at the end of it, broadcasts in silence the names, pictures and fundamental data of the latest deaths. Is this the kind of ritual that we are going to assume in this country? We are going to watch this war on television. This is the kind of sacrifice supposedly being made. This is the kind of confrontation that needs to take place. And the reason we have Iraq Watch, the reason we are down here every week, the reason that we are speaking out now is that the American public has to know that not everybody has been buffaloed, not everyone is silent, not everyone is going to step back from speaking the truth.",

I have made friendships and conducted business, legislative business, and evolved personal relationships over those 30 years with a great number of individuals. I have particularly valued those who are sometimes disparagingly referred to as special interests or lobbyists as if that is seen by many people as a derogatory term or a term of denigration. And I do not see it that way. I want to make it clear in terms of my expressed disappointment with regard to this revelation about Mr. Woolsey; and now I guess I am going to have to wonder about everybody else too that I have a conversation with, I am not trying to keep people from making a living.It does not bother me any. As I say, I have friends who lobby on behalf of what are called special interests. We all have special interests. We are a multiplicity of special interests. One has only to read the Federalist Papers to understand that. In fact, it can be seen as the bulwark of a democratic republic because we do have factions and many interests competing with one another for attention and for approbation. There is no question about that. The only question to be answered in that is do we know that, do we know who they are and what they are and why they are and so on so we can discern what the difference is?I have no problem with people who are our friends, personal and otherwise, making their positions known to me or to anyone else in the Congress or anywhere else in public office. What bothers me is when positions are represented to us and we do not know that someone, in fact, is a paid representative, particularly on issues of war and peace, life and death. The folks know and the Speaker knows that I am a member of the Committee on Armed Services and those are the kinds of things we vote on every day, and I think every member there, regardless of party, takes seriously, deadly seriously, I might say without any sense of irony attached to it, take seriously their responsibility.But we are dependent in the Congress on getting good information. The President of the United States is dependent upon getting good information and making solid judgments based on that information. Anybody who fails to give the best possible information with the fullest knowledge behind it and the resources is undermining the Constitution of the United States and failing their responsibilities as a citizen. In this regard, then, I feel ill used in this process by Mr. Woolsey, and I feel very definitely that the press and the Congress need to make inquiries of everybody who comes before us presenting that information and perspective to us upon which we have to act in matters of life and death. Everybody has to have the fullest inquiry made of them as to what their sources of income are and what their sources of information are, whether they are tainted.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 364, a resolution to recognize the decades of strategic partnership between the United States and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.In 1947, the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) became one of six entities in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands established by the United Nations with the United States as the Trustee. This began a decades long relationship between the United States and RMI that has proven to be resilient and enduring.In particular, I'd like to highlight the United States nuclear testing program in RMI which began in 1946. Over the years, the United States detonated 67 nuclear weapons on the islands of Bikini and Enewetak. These tests comprise 80 percent of all atmospheric tests conducted by the United States and allowed a majority of all tests to be conducted as far from densely populated areas as possible. This testing includes the detonation of Bravo, the most powerful hydrogen bomb ever tested by the United States, on Bikini Atoll. Radiation from the test forced the evacuation of Marshallese and U.S. Military personnel on Rongelap, Rongerik, Utirik and Ailinginae.Over the years, the Marshallese have faced very serious consequences as a result of the nuclear testing. The health and property effects have proved to be extensive and in many cases, immeasurable. The United States has recognized this and set up a fund to compensate those affected by the testing. However, the consequences of this testing, especially the health of the Marshallese people, continue to be impacted.Mr. Speaker, I am sure that our countries will continue to work on this issue and find a resolution. I also have no doubt that the relationship between our governments will continue to be productive and mutually beneficial. Last year, this body worked on reauthorizing the Compacts of Free Association, an agreement between the United States and RMI, to continue our defense and economic alliance that has benefited both countries for 17 years. As a result of this work, the United States and RMI will continue this alliance for another 15 years.I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing our relationship with RMI and commend their dedication to international peace and security.",

There will be no operative government whatsoever, and this is being done entirely for political reasons because of the utter failure of this operation.The gentleman will recall that I indicated back at the time of this invasion that this would not be a war, that this would be a lightning attack on Baghdad, and then the war would start. I trust the gentlemen, both of them, will recall me saying that; and I think it was quite clear to those of us serving on the Committee on Armed Services that was going to be the result, and even then we indicated as a result of the testimony of people like General Shinseki and others, upon whom we have relied to good effect in the past, that unless we were properly prepared with the logistics, even that lightning attack would suffer casualties and set us in circumstance less than what we could be in terms of the military might of this country.That is precisely what happened. That lightning attack was accompanied by consequences in terms of supply and logistics which harmed us and harmed those who served in that attack, and then the war began, and we are suffering from that kind of war right now, as we speak tonight; and on June 30, I can assure you that the level of combat in terms of what the United States is going to suffer is scarcely beyond imagination",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, the gentlewoman from Texas made a very, very strong point of the necessity, I believe I am quoting her correctly, that we have to find a way. We have to find a way to get this message out. We have to find a way to get our message, we have to find a way to engage the American people in a discussion and a dialogue. That is what we are trying to do here.To the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Strickland), if you would indulge me for a moment in yielding, I think it might be apropos that we do take upon ourselves the admonition of the gentlewoman from Texas. We have to find a way.This is our way. Not everyone may understand what it is. They may be going up and down the television and see what is going on. This is called Special Orders. Special Orders means the regular business of the House, that is to say the scheduled business of the House, is completed for the day. This is our opportunity as Representatives, this is the opportunity of the 435 of us, who have had the faith and trust of our constituents placed in us, to come to the floor and engage in a dialogue not just with ourselves, but with the American people. Because part of the difficulty has been is the American people are watching this on television, or reading it in the newspaper, participating, if you will, at a distance, as to what is taking place, unless and until, of course, it hits you full force because a loved one has been hurt or harmed or killed, or someone that you know has had that experience. So it happens sporadically, and, from the point of view of the cosmos, indifferently around the country at various times.So we are here on the floor, and I might say to those tuning in, we are here on the floor of the House of Representatives, surrounded by the galleries. In fact, our good friend the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Costello), the distinguished gentleman from Illinois has a group of his constituents in this gallery right now observing our proceedings.He is explaining to them as we are speaking now what it is we are doing on the floor here. It does not matter that the Chamber is not filled right now.We spent our time this afternoon naming post offices. I was happy to do it. A good friend of mine had one of the post offices named after him. I was pleased to cast my vote for it. A wonderful opportunity to show our expression of what we would say in Hawaii is ``aloha'' for our good friend and others. We were happy to do that.But our business here in these Special Orders is to engage the American people as best we can with that which we have before us. And as the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Costello) now is talking with his constituents here in the gallery, this is the freedom granted to us by the Constitution that we need to take advantage of, that we were obligated to take advantage of.So the regret to me is, as the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Costello) no doubt has pointed out, right behind me here is the press gallery. Empty. Night after night empty. Now, maybe they can say, well, they are watching on television, if they care to.But who wants to pay attention to Special Orders? Well, I will tell my colleagues what happens in Special Orders. Not just this kind of discussion, but my good friend, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Smith), night after night engaged in a conversation on the Social Security trust fund, what it takes to make the Social Security trust fund.In fact, he just walked in right now. That is synchronicity. I did not know he was coming. Did my colleague happen to hear what I had to say? I do not know whether the cameras are on us or not. But the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Smith) has just come in.I cite him as an example, as a prime example of someone who has faithfully come to the floor to explain his position on the Social Security trust fund, the implications of it for our country. That is the kind of thing that needs to be done. That is what this is about.This Iraq Watch that we have faithfully committed ourselves to since the beginning of our concern that this war was going off on the wrong track, that this was taking place, that is why we are here. That is why I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I appreciate the fact that our good friend, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Costello), and his constituents have observed us this evening, have seen democracy in action.I am here to tell you as far as this gentleman is concerned, that I am going to take advantage of this opportunity that we have here on the floor and continue to exchange in the kind of dialogue that I hope will illuminate the issues of our day so that we can get a resolution on behalf of these brave men and women who are serving our country.",

Since the war, French firms are using U.S. operations to bid for contracts in Iraq, though it is unclear whether they will succeed.''The Journal added, ``Between 1998 and 2002, United Nations documents show $397 million in sales to Iraq by French units of U.S. companies. The sales coincided with the period when the Clinton and Bush administrations were increasing pressure on Mr. Hussein, and the practice extended well beyond early 2002, when Mr. Bush included Iraq in his so-called Axis of Evil.Halliburton did tens of millions of dollars of business with Iraq in the late 1990s when it was still led by Vice President Cheney. Much of that business was done through French units. Mr. Cheney said during the 2000 election campaign that Halliburton had a policy against trading with Iraq. The Halliburton contracts mentioned in the United Nations documents involved units and joint ventures that came with the purchase of Dresser, Incorporated in 1998. Will the gentleman recall that during the Watergate investigation, that Woodward and Bernstein, when they were following through on various contacts and leads, that they had reported that it was not always that people were lying to them, it was that they were not telling the truth. Unless you knew the exact question to ask ahead of time, that is to say unless you knew the information and the answers to your questions ahead of time, you might actually ask a question in which the other party could avoid telling you the truth while not absolutely lying to you.It may well have been, as Mr. Cheney said, that Halliburton had a policy against trading with Iraq, but apparently it did not mean that units or subunits of Halliburton located in other nations could do the trading for them, thus benefiting and profiting the Halliburton company while Mr. Cheney was in charge of it. This is the caliber of the Vice President's ability to have any kind of veracity when it comes to statements about weapons of mass destruction or anything else having to do with whether or not he or his company profited from trading with Iraq.",

We got into Baghdad the same day, or within 24 hours or so of the time Ambassador Bremer was replacing or complementing the service of General Garner.I can tell the gentleman because I believe it was the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) who mentioned that General Garner had some ideas about what needed to be done vis-a-vis reconstruction. I can affirm to the gentleman based on his suggestion which he just made about elections that General Garner felt very strongly at that time that councils of one kind and another should be allowed to be set up, that we could go to the Iraqi people and trust that they would put these together with a minimum of structure, if you will, from the United States. That is to say we could help provide the logistical capacity to help conduct the elections, but he felt they should move forward expeditiously.And I can tell you his suggestions were made in a context in which he was shoved laterally just about as fast as he could go. I think we are going to find General Garner, who was kind of dismissed as someone who did not quite understand what was going on, from the point of view of history will be shown as having a clear idea of what needed to be done.",

The RMI has always been, and continues to be, a great ally of the United States and is dedicated to international peace and freedom. Therefore, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 410.By the beginning of the 1900's, the RMI was annexed by Spain, Germany, and Japan. In 1934, the Allied invasion and occupation of the RMI began. In 1947, the RMI became one of six entities in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands established by the United Nations with the United States as the Trustee. Throughout all these years of being occupied, the people of RMI never lost their self-identity or hope for their own country. This hope grew in the decades after World War II as a local form of self-government was established. This led to the convening of a constitutional convention.In 1979, the people of the RMI adopted a constitution and chose their form of government, a republic. With separation of powers and a Bill of Rights listing guaranteed rights, the RMI is based on the same principals and freedoms that the United States was founded on hundreds of years ago. Similar to our founding, it was the will of the people driving the process and making the decisions.The RMI is now a sovereign nation. As a sovereign nation, the RMI has aligned itself closely with the U.S., particularly in a number of defense and strategic issues. Recently, we have renewed our mutually beneficial relationship by reauthorizing the Compact of Free Association. This has guaranteed that our alliance will continue for another 15 years.I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution and recognize the 25th anniversary of the adoption of RMI's constitution. Their commitment and dedication to peace and democracy should be commended.",

The Guard is falling behind in their recruitment and retention, and those strains and those stresses are going to become more apparent in the days and months to come, and the stress and strain in the days and months to come will manifest itself in the inability of the United States to have the kinds of deployments under the circumstances that would be most ideal to maximize the efficiency of the Armed Forces.It is not that they will not try.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, the Governor of my State recently went on a trip to Iraq. When she returned, she announced that the President's Iraq policy should not be the subject of political discussion. That suggestion is as problematic as it is unrealistic. Foreign policy and defense policy are always legitimate topics of political debate. That's how we do things in a democracy. The voting public has every right to a full and open airing of different points of view--especially when the lives of our service members and the treasury of our Nation are being committed.Now, with this resolution it seems the Republicans want it both ways. They tell us Iraq policy is out of bounds for political discussion, and at the same time they present us with this resolution. This document amplifying the administration's spin is nothing less than an election-year endorsement of the President's Iraq policy. It will no doubt be denied that it has anything to do with politics. In fact it's blatantly political. It's transparently political. It's in-your-face political.Our troops deserve better than this cursory salute swaddled in suffocating layers of political celebration. They've earned our gratitude for their patriotism, courage and spirit of sacrifice. More to the point, they deserve a solid commitment to their well being and the well being of their families. But that is something the majority refuses to do. Last week in the House Budget Committee, Mr. Edwards and others proposed some simple measures along these lines: TRICARE for reservists; a boost in imminent danger pay; improved military housing; higher pay for senior enlisted personnel; increased family separation allowance; and more funding for family support centers.All of this is to be offset by a very modest rollback in the tax bonanza we granted to people making a million dollars a year and more. The majority's response? Forget about the troops--our allegiance is to people making a million or more. I don't have any statistics, but I suspect there aren't too many millionaires serving in Iraq or en route.So let's not pretend this resolution has nothing to do with politics. It's about the politics of deception underlying this war. It's about the politics of delusion that we can remake the world in our own image. It's about the politics of desperation flowing from the realization that we're becoming stuck in a no-exit quagmire.As for the troops, they're getting thin rations from the majority in this House. Saying you support the troops is easy. The issue here isn't whether anyone in this House supports the troops. We all do. The issue is whether we can fashion a policy worthy of their valor, dedication and sacrifice.",

He went on to state that anyone commenting on the fact that 2,000 fighting men and women have died in Iraq in our name, that anyone who even comments on that at this stage is not entitled to regard themselves as being truly a patriotic American by implication. He went on to say that this does not even rise to the level of a story.Well, Mr. Speaker, I bet it was a story to the parents and loved ones of the fighting man who died No. 2,000. This is a benchmark, yes, a benchmark of the failure and our failure here in the Congress to come to grips with what the word ``sacrifice'' really means.We are not sacrificing in this country. We are watching it on TV. We are adding it up.

I hope at least some of the staff, some folks may be paying attention.Our problem here is very, very simple. Over and over again our colleagues will say to us, well, I got out of this okay, or we have resolved that issue. I am one of those folks. I can say that. I have had people come up and say to me, well, why are you bothering? Pearl Harbor made it out of there.Why was it taken up in the first place? I will tell you why. It is politics. This has nothing to do with whether or not there is some rational process that has been undertaken, and everybody in here knows it. For once, can we not come down on this floor and actually vote the way all of us really understand where our responsibilities are?Pearl Harbor got brought up for a very simple reason. They were going to close a facility up in Maine, and the people in Maine in their panic said, do not take us, take Pearl Harbor instead. They started comparing some naval apples, some shipyard apples with some shipyard oranges, and they came up with, well, go get Pearl Harbor. It had nothing to do with it. I did not come back and say, no, no, no, not us; go back to Maine, go get them. What kind of a process is that where we try to devour each other? I said, let us keep all of them open. We need every shipyard facility that we can get in this country.We are going to be going back out to Guam soon because of what is taking place in the Pacific right now, and having to recapitulate everything that got put under the water out there in Guam, billions of dollars is going to have to be put back into Guam in order for us to be able to protect and project our strategic interests in the Pacific.We are under a review right now in the Armed Services Committee, and we do not even have the courage of our own convictions under our own jurisdictions in our committees.It is not that I am right or Mr. LaHood is right or Mr. Hobson is wrong or right, or Mr. Taylor. That is not the issue. The issue is are we meeting our responsibilities here? We are constantly admonished that no sacrifice is too great. We are constantly admonished that we have to honor the sacrifices that are being made by our fighting men and women all over the world right now. Yet we cringe from our own responsibilities as Members of Congress to meet those responsibilities and obligations with regard to bases.Now, I have been told over and over again, well, that is all well and good, but people are going to come down here, and you are going to lose anyway. It happens occasionally some people come down and say, you know, I was going to vote the other way. Let us, for once, come down here, and I make this appeal out there to anybody who is thinking about coming to the floor. Vote for Mr. LaHood's recommendation.We are not down here just to hear ourselves. When you come over here, search your conscience, and, for once, let us live up to what people expect of us in this Congress. For once let us not fulfill some stereotype that we are just going to roll over because we managed to make it out the door. That is not what we are here for.If this is just a job to you, then do not run again. This is a calling. This is a vocation. It is supposed to be. That is the way I feel about it, and I know that is the way most Members feel about it. They want to be able to look in the mirror at night and recognize somebody with a little bit of integrity and walk into their homes justified.If we are going to justify our job, everybody knows in their heart that we should not be voting for this, regardless of our good friends being on it, like Mr. Hansen and Mr. Bilbray, for example, who are colleagues and personal friends to many of us here. It is not a question of whether they did their job or did not do their job; it is whether we are doing our job, and we are meeting our obligations.So I appeal to everybody on their way over here. Let us vote for Ray LaHood's resolution, and let us do the right thing by ourselves and the Nation.",

This is a fitting tribute for a man who was a great statesman, businessman and community leader.Senator Fong was born on October 15, 1906, in Kalihi. He was the seventh of 11 children in an immigrant family. A firm believer of standing on his own feet, he worked numerous odd jobs while in public school in order to help support his family. He worked his way through the University of Hawaii where he graduated with honors in 1930. He went on to Harvard Law School and became the state and county Deputy Attorney General of Honolulu for three years.At the age of 31, Senator Fong began his public service career by serving in Hawaii's Territorial House of Representatives. His ability to work well with both Democrats and Republicans was quickly identified and he was elected Speaker of the House during his first term in office. In 1959, he was elected to the first of three consecutive terms in the U.S. Senate.Senator Fong never forgot his humble beginnings and was an ardent supporter of labor rights. Despite being a Republican, Senator Fong enjoyed widespread support from the labor unions, particularly the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) which endorsed Senator Fong's candidacy to Congress and campaigned for his reelection.Senator Fong played an integral role in Hawaii becoming the 50th state and worked on many landmark laws such as the authorization of the Interstate Highway System and the establishment of the East-West Center.Senator Fong's work and leadership will impact generations to come and it is with great honor that I rise to support S. 2089 in recognition of his leadership and service to this country. I ask my colleagues to support this measure and appreciate the House's attention to the life and work of this great man.",

    "title": "JAMES CAMPBELL NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE EXPANSION ACT OF 2005",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, thank you for considering S. 1165 on the floor today. By authorizing the expansion of the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge, NWR, we are protecting endangered and migratory birds from the effects of an increasingly urban island.Located on the northern end of the island of Oahu, the Campbell NWR is the premier recovery area on the island for all four endangered Hawaiian waterbirds. The refuge consists of approximately 241 acres of naturally occurring, spring-fed marsh and manmade ponds in two separate parcels. Although the refuge was established specifically to benefit the endangered Hawaiian stilt (ae`o), coot (`alae ke`oke`o), moorhen (`alae `ula), and duck (koloa maoli), it also provides essential habitat for at least 25 species of wintering migratory birds coming from as far away as Alaska, New Zealand, and Asia.The expansion proposed by S. 1165 would connect these two parcels, providing a protected flyway and essential habitat. The expansion would also incorporate significant coastal property and preserve the last remaining large scale sand dune ecosystem. This boundary enlargement will preserve native strand species as well as coastal wildlife such as threatened green sea turtles, seabirds, migratory shorebirds and possibly the threatened Hawaiian monk seal.As a dual benefit, this expansion would also help protect the neighboring town of Kahuku from devastating floods. The refuge expansion serves as an important component of the Kahuku flood control project by increasing drainage capacity and preserving the floodwater retention of these protected wetlands. In turn, the flood mitigation project could potentially enhance the wetland area to ensure maximum production and survival of endangered Hawaiian waterbird populations. The importance of this added benefit has been made clear as recent rains in Hawaii have flooded the town of Kahuku along with its schools and homes.The Campbell NWR is a haven to endangered and migratory birds. Its expansion would further the goals of the refuge and the Refuge System while helping to protect an adjacent town from intermittent flooding.I would also like to thank Chairman Pombo and Ranking Member Rahall for their support and efforts in addressing this issue. I respectfully request my colleagues to support this measure and its intent to protect the wildlife on the north shore of Oahu.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the Hawaii State Legislature for increasing penalties for adults who supply alcohol to persons under the legal drinking age of 21. I believe this is one important step toward attacking the supply chain that fuels the national problem of underage drinking.According to authorities, adults are by far the main source of alcohol for underage drinkers. A report to Congress by the National Academy of Sciences identified friends and adult purchasers as the most frequent sources of alcohol among college students and older adolescents. Family members were cited as the most frequent source for younger adolescents. The Century Council, a not-for-profit educational organization dedicated to fighting drunk driving and underage drinking, found that 65 percent of underage drinkers get their alcohol from family and adult friends.Hawaii's new law is among 7 bills that have passed into law and nearly 20 that have been introduced in States throughout our great Nation that link underage drinking and providing alcohol to those under 21 with a penalty relating to the revocation of driving privileges for the offender. Diageo, a large beverage alcohol company, in an example of enlightened corporate citizenship, is among the firms that have led the effort to move this type of legislation in state legislatures throughout the country. As such, many have referred to bills like Hawaii's new law as a ``Diageo Bill.''The American Legislative Exchange Council has made the ``Diageo Bill'' one of their model pieces of legislation for 2006. I urge all States to pass this type of measure.While only one piece of this important puzzle, the State of Hawaii along with the people at Diageo and those of similarly committed companies should be commended for being a leader in the fight against underage drinking.",

And it was considered that way in committee, and I am grateful for it.The bill was passed overwhelmingly last week 262-162. It was under the Suspension Calendar and did not receive a sufficient number of votes for the two-thirds required margin, so we find the bill before us this evening.Of those 162 Republicans who voted ``no'' last week, 39 of them cosponsored the bill to create the Native Hawaiian Housing Title in the 106th Congress, including our good friend, Mr. Bachus, and minority leader John Boehner.This reauthorization and improvements were requested by Hawaii's Republican Governor, Linda Lingle. The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands is chaired by the former head of the State's Republican Party.This bill was introduced last year by Congressman Ney and was reported out of the Financial Services Committee by voice vote without amendment. And last year's Republican chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mike Oxley, was also a cosponsor of the bill.I bring these things up, Mr. Speaker, to emphasize that never have we ever considered this bill to be a partisan bill, a Republican or Democratic bill. This is a bill that affects constituents, regardless of their political affiliation, and is not ideological in nature. It is really administrative in nature.There have been some discussions and some arguments concerning some of the constitutional issues that have been raised in other contexts about native people. This is not the venue to have that kind of a discussion or argument. We do not want to harm those who come before us for legislative redress and expect to have it and not expect to have an argument in which they will become grist for an ideological mill, grist for a disputation of an academic nature or of a philosophical nature, having nothing to do with the question at hand, in this instance, most particularly dealing with homeownership, mortgages, and refinancing.I understand, and will defer to Mr. Bachus on this point, that Mr. Renzi has made a statement of support in addition, and I expect to hear about that when we yield to Mr. Bachus for his participation.Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize again that this is not a partisan bill. It is not really anything that should be considered other than on the merits of the subject matter at hand.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

I believe they can be answered.I believe that this is fundamentally a very conservative approach that merits the support of Members across the various ideological spectrums that exist here in the House of Representatives; and I hope, with the opportunity to speak about them at some length, perhaps tomorrow, that we will be able to satisfy one and all here on the floor that this is a bill worthy of support.The principal thing I would say, just simply in quick response, is that the Rice versus Cayetano decision which was mentioned does not affect these programs, has literally nothing to do with the issue at hand in this H.R. 835. The decision invalidated an election system for a State agency, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a State agency. The decision did not affect the agency itself. It did not even question the validity of the agency. It had to do with the question of who could vote for the trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs.The Office of Hawaiian Affairs still exists today. It exists for the benefit of Native Hawaiians and is voted on by the entire voting population of the State of Hawaii. So it had to do with an election issue and absolutely nothing to do with this, and the Court declined to address the question of Native Hawaiian programs authorized by Congress. So we are dealing with an entirely separate set of issues here, and I hope to make that clear tomorrow.At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to Representative Hirono.",

You had more than enough time to make your case.Madam Chairman, I am going to make a case for those children and the children in Hawaii and the children in every other State and area in this country who deserve the support of this Congress. I have heard talk already down here today about taxes being paid. You don't think taxes are being paid in Alaska or in Hawaii or elsewhere?When you talk about local programs, I have the local programs that we have in Hawaii. I am sure Mr. Young has the local programs that we have in Alaska. I haven't examined them in New Jersey, but, as I say, I have heard the rhetoric for the last few minutes. Maybe I had better go up there and give them a hand.Now, I respect every Member of this floor, and I expect to receive the same in return. When the State of Hawaii came into the Union, one of the protocols of the Admissions Act is the requirement that we recognize and take care of our Hawaiian children. We have programs that are geared towards that. We have Historically Black Colleges in this country. We have established over the past few decades studies in various backgrounds, ethnically, culturally, racially. We have caucuses in this Congress that recognize the various backgrounds from which our people come.Hawaii, I can tell you, just as Alaska is, because I have visited Alaska and have had an opportunity to speak with the teachers and schoolchildren in Alaska, we are a multi-cultural, multi-racial, multi-ethnic country. We are a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-background, rainbow state in Hawaii, and we recognize those backgrounds and we try to take care of it in our educational processes.All we are asking for is the opportunity here to help fund local programs that have local assistance as well. That is done in program after program after program.Now, if the gentleman does not care to have the Federal Government fund anything for education in the United States, that is his prerogative. I recognize that and respect that. I don't approve of it, and I hope the Congress won't approve of it. But to have any Member come into another State without any notice to anybody that they are going to do it, by the way, a courtesy that I would extend to anybody in here, I have to find out about it by osmosis that this is being done, it is shameful and it needs to be stopped and it needs to have an end put to it.Now, if the gentleman has specific objections to anything being done in Alaska, he should have taken it up with the gentleman from Alaska. That is minimum courtesy in this body. But to come on the floor and make the kind of accusations that are made today is an insult to the gentleman from Alaska and an insult to the Appropriations Committee and an insult to the House of Representatives.If there are objections to anything in the next one that comes up, I hope that whoever offers that amendment with Hawaii would have had the courtesy to sit down with me and with Representative Hirono and specifically state what their objections were, so that we might be able to accommodate them, had they legitimacy and foundation. That is the minimum we can expect from one another.This is a shameful process. I hadn't realized until right now that we could solve the educational problems in this country if we could just keep those Alaskan kids from getting a dime for any program that has been put together by Representative Young and the local educators in Alaska.The CHAIRMAN.

And some people in a boat wearing kind of quaint hats and cloaks with breeches seem to be rowing into shore. And the one Native American says to the other, Doesn't look like they have their documentation in order to me.Now, I don't know if that is anything other than perhaps mildly amusing, but perhaps it does make a point. I'm not sure that we're in any position to say to Native American tribes in this country that everybody ought to have their documentation in order.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I'm very grateful and thank you. I want to thank Mr. Bishop for his kind remarks. It exemplifies, I think, the kind of relationship we have on the Resources Committee. And I want to repeat that for those who are in their offices, maybe are not here on the floor but in their offices and may be tuning in. I want to emphasize that the tenor of his remarks and the courtesy with which he put it forward, including his sense of humor, which is well recognized in the committee and appreciated, reflects that this legislation is not only bipartisan, it's nonpartisan. That is to say, it's not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue and has never been presented on this floor, through all the different sections of the Congress, from its introduction over the past 7 years and as it has moved through the Congress over past sessions, it has never ever been presented as a partisan issue, Republican or Democrat. And I say ``nonpartisan'' because the committee reflects the full spectrum of the left of the Democratic Party and the right of the Republican Party. Whether you are characterized as a progressive or a conservative, this issue transcends that precisely for what Mr. Bishop so rightly pointed out.This bill directly affects and only affects the ceded lands and the Hawaiian homelands and the assets associated with Native Hawaiians in Hawaii. Everybody who's on the Resources Committee and everybody who has dealt with issues that have come before the body as a whole coming out of the Resources Committee understands that there are particular and peculiar instances associated with each Member's district, whether it's salmon runs in the Northwest or whether it's water issues based on treaty obligations in the Southwest, whether it's indigenous people in Alaska or indigenous people in Hawaii. Each area has particular contexts and situations that need to be addressed legislatively. And so what the committee tries to do in a nonpartisan way is address those issues in a very specific manner so that they can be resolved without impinging on any other aspect of constitutional consideration.Let me point out practically how that happens. For those of you who have visited Hawaii, when you land at the airport, you're landing on what's called ceded land. That ceded land produces revenue. Now, obviously the airport didn't exist back when the Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown in 1893, and it didn't exist when the United States annexed the Kingdom of Hawaii as a territory of the United States, and that airport as it is configured today did not exist with the advent of statehood. And so what we have now is very, very valuable land producing revenue. And that's what this is all about, 1.8 million acres of ceded land coming in a continuum from the time of the overthrow of the kingdom down to the State of Hawaii today where the ownership of the land, and the benefit's very clearly recognized, including in the Admissions Act of Hawaii to the State of the Union: Public Law 8-3, March 18, 1959, which specifically requires us to address questions of benefiting Native Hawaiians through the lands that have been ceded to them or which were created for them by the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920. That's what we're dealing with here today.So we are asking that deference be given to the committee's work, which has been nonpartisan, which has no ideological difficulties associated with it, that deference be given and understanding to what the Admissions Act requires of us.And I find it ironic that support comes from Mr. Young, Mr. Don Young, as it came from other Republican chairmen. In fact, this was first introduced under Republican chairmen, passed under Republican chairmen. Mr. Hansen of Utah and Mr. Pombo of California and Mr. Young of Alaska, as well as Mr. Miller and Mr. Rahall, all have supported this act, as have the committees. Mr. Young is now in Alaska speaking to the Federation of Natives, of Alaskan Natives, because we recognize that there are indigenous people who were not a party to the Constitution when it was formed and first passed but have activities, and in the contemporary context, their lives' affected by how we deal with them. The Constitution requires us as a Member of Congress to be able to do that.So what is at stake here very, very simply for the Members is that this is enabling legislation. That's all it is. This creates the opportunity for Native Hawaiians to take responsibility for their own actions with regard to the control and administration of their own assets. That is not in dispute. The land boundaries are there. The amount of money that's coming in is not in dispute. What's in dispute is who's going to control those assets. That's what this is about. This gives the opportunity to Native Hawaiians to organize themselves to come back to the Secretary of the Interior, whoever that may be, and to ask the Secretary of the Interior to recognize that governing entity over these assets. If the Secretary of the Interior disagrees with it, they have to go back to the drawing board. This is enabling legislation, and it's enabling legislation that has been put together responsibly by responsible members of the Resources Committee in consultation with one another and with various administrations, and we would ask for your favorable consideration on the floor today.",

I knew something would follow on that, and of course it was his reservations about the bill.But he cited a poll which seemed to indicate, I believe he said, that people were obviously against race-based legislation and so on. I don't blame them; I would think they would be. I'm surprised it wasn't 100 percent. But let me read what the question was. He didn't read us the question. Here's the question: ``If 505 would allow Native Hawaiians to create their own government not subject to all the same laws, regulations and taxes that apply to other citizens of Hawaii, do you want Congress to approve this bill?'' Well, I'm dumbfounded they couldn't get 100 percent against that question. And, of course, 505 doesn't do any of that; quite the opposite. As Mr. Rahall indicated, we specifically address those issues, and taxes, of course, are going to be paid.Let me give you the Ward Research Poll, done this year, that is a real poll, and I will tell you the question: ``Have you heard of the bill, the Akaka bill?'' Yes, 84 percent. ``Do you think Hawaiians should be recognized by the U.S. as an indigenous group similar to recognition given American Indians and Native Alaskans?'' Yes, 70 percent. ``Do you believe Hawaiians have a right to make these decisions?'' Yes, 87 percent. ``Do you believe programs that have been passed by the Congress for Native Hawaiians should continue?'' Yes, 83 percent. This goes on and on at that kind of level in Hawaii.So, I appreciate my good friend bringing up the question of polling, but I think it's useful for us to know that when the people of Hawaii are polled on an objective basis, there is overwhelming support, Republican and Democrat and independent, for resolving this issue in the manner in which 505 addresses.",

Obviously it is very, very important to all of us and important on a fundamental constitutional basis as well. The difficulty for me in doing that is that I am seeing it right now for the first time. The language in the bill has been gone over and over and over again with a legal fine tooth comb so that I have confidence in that.My problem is that your intention and my intention may not be what the consequences legally would be when somebody reads it as written on the paper. My friend and mentor on the Armed Services Committee, the chairman, Ike Skelton, who usually characterizes himself as a country lawyer, which should put everybody on edge and make them wary when he says it, has a saying that he admonishes us with on the Armed Services Committee all the time: Read it. What he means by that is the words on the paper are what will be referred to when legal recourse is taken. And what my fear is, is that not knowing the consequences of the language, despite the gentleman's intention, if I accepted such a thing, I am doing it on blind faith. Not on blind faith in you. I have faith in your good intentions. But I am doing it on blind faith as to what the safe harbor would be or not be or what the consequences would be.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the passage of H.R. 3332, the Kalaupapa Memorial Act of 2007. This measure would authorize Ka Ohana O Kalaupapa to establish a memorial to honor those who were forcibly relocated to Kalaupapa.Kalaupapa is a National Historical Park located on a remote peninsula of northern Molokai. From 1866 through 1969, about 8,000 people afflicted with Hansen's disease, previously known as leprosy, were relocated to the area now known as Kalaupapa National Historical Park.Many of the first settlers faced a harsh and difficult life. But the patients who were sent to Kalaupapa eventually built a community that allowed them to endure a life cut off from parents, children, brothers, sisters and friends. Even after medication was developed to control Hansen's disease, many patient residents chose to continue living in Kalaupapa.The site became a national park in 1980 and is dedicated to preserving the memories and lessons of the past. Kalaupapa is a living memorial to a community that once lived in extreme isolation. It now serves as a place of education, contemplation and quiet beauty. Unfortunately, many of the residents who finished their life in Kalaupapa do not have recognizable graves or grave markers. The memorial established by this bill would serve as a permanent marker and reminder of all 8,000 residents who lived on Kalaupapa.A little more than 20 patients remain in Kalaupapa. As time passes, the number of former residents of Kalaupapa gets smaller, as do the number of people who remember this part of Hawaii's history. With each passing, the sense of urgency for erecting a memorial becomes more and more heightened. We need to pass this bill as soon as possible so that this memorial becomes a reality before the passing of the next Kalaupapa resident.My colleague Representative Mazie Hirono has worked tremendously hard to bring this bill to the floor today. I commend her efforts and would also like to express my gratitude to Representative Nick Rahall, Chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, and Representative Raul Grijalva, Chairperson of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands. We would not be here today were it not for their support and enthusiasm. I wholeheartedly support this bill, am proud to be an original cosponsor and ask my colleagues for their support of ",

On this important centennial, I would like to commemorate the men and women who have served and continue to serve in the shipyard. In their honor, I have introduced H. Res. 1193.Congress established the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on May 13, 1908, and it has grown from a ``coaling and repair station'' to being known as the ``No Ka Oi Shipyard'' and a national treasure that is strategically important to our Nation and equally vital to Hawaii. During World War II, shipyard workers earned the motto, ``We keep them fit to fight'', by resurrecting the United States Pacific Fleet from the bottom of Pearl Harbor, helping turn the tide of the war at Midway, and maintaining the ships that would ultimately win victory at sea and sail triumphantly into Tokyo Bay.Throughout the decades, the shipyard has demonstrated its diverse capabilities by supporting America's space exploration, Antarctic expeditions, and national missile defense. It continues to support the United States Pacific Fleet as the largest ship repair facility between the western coast of the United States and the Far East, providing full-service maintenance for Pacific Fleet ships and submarines throughout the Asia-Pacific theater.The shipyard has become the largest single industrial employer in Hawaii and is the largest fully integrated military-civilian workforce involved in full-service shipyard work in the United States. The shipyard has a direct annual economic impact of more than $600,000,000 in Hawaii, and through its apprentice, engineer co-op, and other student-hire programs, provides extraordinary training, employment, and career opportunities for residents. Moreover, the shipyard has earned multiple national awards for its dedicated environmental stewardship and excellent safety programs, such as the prestigious Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Star award in May 2007.On this historic day, I would like to recognize the 100th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and congratulate the men and women who provide exceptional service to our military and keep our Pacific Fleet ``fit to fight.''",

A reasoned and objective approach is needed for analyzing and assessing the serious issues surrounding the potential for nuclear weapons proliferation in Iran. The current bill language couples military readiness and contingency response planning with report elements that are inherently intelligence-related and dependent on the full spectrum of intelligence sources and methods.The amendment appropriately shifts the burden of assessment regarding Iran's nuclear weapons capacity and/or intentions from the Secretary of Defense to the Director of National Intelligence. Why reinvent the wheel? Precedent and institutional knowledge specific to the issue already exist. The appropriate vehicle for perpetuating objective analysis of the situation is an updated NIE, with further updates regularly to follow, not an independent and parallel effort on the part of the DOD.Renewing demand for products of the proven method of consolidating analysis through a centralized NIE process also discourages the temptation for some to ``forum shop,'' I assure you, among national security agencies for favorable or dissenting views, depending on the circumstance. We are all well aware of the Douglas Feith-led, Dick Cheney-originated cabal that was a major instigator of the war in Iraq.A disassociated DOD effort would undermine a widely considered and properly vetted approach to nuclear proliferation and other high priority national security issues.The amendment substantially reflects many of the points of inquiry from the report elements in the bill's existing language, but it centers the focus on an updated NIE analysis on the near and mid-term implications rather than on the speculative far-term projections, and does not rush to associate U.S. military response as a presupposition.On that basis, Madam Chairman, I think this amendment deserves our favorable attention, and I thank you for the time allotted to me.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.I rise today to recognize Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on its 100th anniversary. On this important centennial, I would like to commemorate the men and women who have served and continue to serve in the shipyard. In their honor, we have introduced H. Res. 1139.The Congress established the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on May 13, 1908, and it has grown from a coaling and repair station to being known in Hawaiian as the ``No Ka Oi Shipyard''--``No Ka Oi'' meaning the best--and is a national treasure that is strategically important to our Nation and equally vital to Hawaii.During World War II, shipyard workers earned the motto, ``We keep them fit to fight,'' by resurrecting the United States Pacific Fleet from the bottom of Pearl Harbor, helping to turn the tide of war at Midway, and maintaining the ships that would ultimately win victory at sea and sail triumphantly into Tokyo Bay.Throughout the decades, the shipyard has demonstrated its diverse capabilities by supporting America's space exploration, Antarctic expeditions, and national missile defense. It continues to support the United States Pacific Fleet as the largest ship repair facility between the West Coast of the United States and the Far East, providing full-service maintenance for Pacific Fleet ships and submarines throughout the Asia Pacific theater.The shipyard has become the largest single industrial employer in Hawaii and is the largest fully integrated military-civilian workforce involved in full service shipyard work in the United States. The shipyard has a direct annual economic impact of more than $600 million in Hawaii, and through its apprentice, engineer co-op, and other student hire programs, provides extraordinary training, employment, and career opportunities for residents.Moreover, the shipyard has earned multiple national awards for its dedicated environmental stewardship and excellent safety programs, such as the prestigious Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Star Award in May of 2007.I want to recognize the 100th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and congratulate the men and women who provide exceptional service to our military and indeed keep the Pacific Fleet ``fit to fight.''Madam Speaker, I'm going to reserve the balance of my time at this point.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I want to compliment Mr. Wittman and I want to thank him. It is perhaps by coincidence, but a happy coincidence, that the gentleman, of course, is from Virginia. And with Virginia and Hawaii, we represent the east coast and the far west coast, I guess--really west--in Hawaii.And I want to thank him as well for his excellent statement. Part of the reason being that he has outlined very, very well, I think, one of the most important issues that we face and one that does not always receive the kind of attention that I think it warrants, namely, our shipyards as a resource, and meeting the strategic interests of the United States.Our shipyards, both public and private, are crucial, vital and necessary not only to the defense of the United States, but to seeing to it that, should we be called upon to exert military activity anywhere in the world, the backbone, the foundation of any naval presence in any such contingency is dependent on the professionalism, dedication and perseverance of shipyards in this Nation.He also mentioned, of course, the Virginia Class submarines, the nuclear submarines. And having observed the maintenance facilities in Hawaii at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, I can assure you and Mr. Wittman that those Virginia Class submarines will be welcomed there, and that the repair and maintenance will be handled by people at the height of their professional capacity.The military's counsel there, the Pearl Harbor supervisors--some of whom I believe are in the gallery today observing what we're carrying out today in terms of the resolution--understand that we're going through more than just simply a ritual undertaking. I think that perhaps sometimes these resolutions get put into that category in the sense that it appears sometimes that we're going through the motions. But I'm sure you know, Madam Speaker, that one of the advantages of ritual in our society and among our species is that ritual is the great conservator of value. It is a measurement of our sense of ourselves, where we've been, where we're going, and what we have as the basis for the future.And so, yes, we're commemorating the 100th anniversary today of Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, but in doing so, we remind ourselves of its historic legacy and we remind ourselves as well as to what the future may require of us here in the United States. The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard stands ready to do its duty. Yes, Madam Speaker, I can tell you Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard will see that our naval forces are ``fit to fight.''Madam Speaker, at this time, I have no further requests for time. I am prepared to close after my colleague has yielded back his time. And I will continue to reserve my time pending that happy occasion.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I want to thank John Peterson as we move on this bill, whatever happens tonight. I notice there are some Members we have been working with.This is kind of an emotional moment for me, I will tell you, because one of the great sorrows that I am going to have out of this is not so much that our bill didn't make it to the floor, but that John Peterson is leaving the Congress of the United States. Of course, he is doing it always for the right reasons, for somebody else, and, of course, we hope that your wife, John, is going to be well. I send her greetings and love and affection tonight, the love and affection we bear for you. You make the word ``honorable'' mean something very deep and real in this House.I see Mr. Bishop and others. Mrs. Drake was here. There are so many names we were working with: Jim Costa and Dan Boren, Bill Foster, Timmy Walz, Tim Murphy. So many people. I am going to risk hurting people's feelings if I don't name everybody. But I have got to say Dan Burton or he will yell at me. So many folks. Jeff Miller, so many. Nick Lampson, he is down there tonight.The reason I bring all those names up is that we are productive with H.R. 6709 I think because we got away from lobbyists coming in or corporations coming, advocacy groups, and we got away from the leadership clash, if you will, over who is going to get the House or who might not.In all honesty, I want to move this bill tonight. I agree, by the way, with Don Young, I agree with what John just said, what Thelma said, all the folks over here on sharing the revenues. I think we didn't have enough information coming from the CBO on that. It looks now like we can put royalties in and it won't create a pay-as-you-go problem.There are a lot of things that can be done, if we can move the bill along. That is what I am asking, just move this bill along. It is like Jim Costa said earlier, a work in progress. Come on, there are very few rookies here, very few rookies legislatively, even if you are just new in the body. We have got four or five different shots at this in order to perfect a bill.I wouldn't vote for this bill if it came back now and this was conference bill. I wouldn't vote for it. But this gives us an opportunity to move this along. That is all I am looking for. And, believe me, the Republicans can claim they forced the Democrats to take it up and they made their point, and the Democrats will claim that they went for the bigger national interest and acted in a nonpartisan way.Everybody can make their political claims. But let's keep this moving. We have been talking to Saxby Chambliss, come on, a lot of us served with him here in the House; and Lindsey Graham, he is our friend; Ben Nelson, Mary Landrieu. I told Mary, left a message, said, look, don't say it's dead on arrival. We are for the revenue sharing. We can work this out.The American people will blame all of us. The American people will not say the Democrats have showed up the Republicans, or the Republicans sure showed the Democrats. They are going to blame the Congress, because they want energy independence. We have to have it.My plea to you is that we take this bill and move it along and get it into the Senate. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain in terms of energy independence, number one; and, number two, preventing the exporting of needed American dollars from investment in this country to import energy. That's the reason that we need to do this.We have got to get away from, I see there is something from the National Wildlife Federation, comes in today, a lot of praise for the bill, but they don't like the oil shale provision, where it's an opt-in from the State, so they still kill the whole bill, kill everything because there is something in it they don't like. We urge you to oppose it and the motion to recommit too. So we end up with nothing.Other people, we have been using words like ``hoax,'' despite claims to the contrary, this is not a drilling bill. Believe me, when the Speaker came around on this, and it's one of the reasons I feel we should move forward with the bill, the Speaker doesn't want this bill, believe me. But she is not the leader of the California delegation, she is the Speaker of the House, and she feels that something has to move along, even if she doesn't approve of most of the provisions that are in here, if she had her own personal way. What I am asking is let's rise above the arguments. Let's rise above the clash with one another.I don't say that for altruistic reasons, I say it for practical reasons, practical legislative reasons. We will not be forgiven by the people of this Nation if we are not able to move an energy bill to the Senate so we have a fighting chance to try and work the legislative process here. Let's not have the kids that come to visit us every day, the people who come to our office sincerely asking us for our help, look at us and say they couldn't do the job that they were sent here to do.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise to urge the immediate support for the expansion of the eligibility of benefits for Filipino vets.On July 26, 1941, Franklin Roosevelt brought the Philippine Commonwealth Forces under the control of the United States during World War II. Yet when their service ended, they did not receive the same benefits or treatment as other American soldiers.Congress passed the Rescission Act in 1946, against General MacArthur's open objections. This even includes such things as burial benefits. No other group of veterans has been systematically denied these benefits. There will be only 20,000 left by 2010.There is some contention here that the Filipino veterans that fought with us as allies are not U.S. citizens. We are paying Sunni tribesmen who killed American soldiers bribe money today in Iraq, but the Filipino vets who saved American soldiers are left out of the benefits as allies of the United States.This is shameful and needs to be stopped immediately. Bring those benefits to these Filipino vets, who are the allies and comrades in arms of United States soldiers.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Filipino American Heritage Month. It is with great pleasure that I join Filipinos across the country in recognizing the history, culture, and accomplishments of Filipino Americans. Filipino American Heritage Month has been celebrated nationwide every October since 1988, and the Hawaii State Legislature, on April 15, 2008, was the first governing body to officially recognize the month.There are nearly 4 million people of Filipino descent in the United States, and a sizeable population of this group resides in my home State of Hawaii. Filipino Americans have been in the United States since the 18th century and have been in Hawaii since 1906, when the first Filipino migrant laborers came to Hawaii to work on the sugar and pineapple plantations. Those Filipinos, their descendants, and the recent immigrants to Hawaii and America have made an indelible impact on our culture, and we should be sure to take this month to recognize the contributions of Filipino Americans.While Filipinos have made great contributions to America, it is important that we not overlook the needs of the community, including a fair and sensible immigration policy. I chair the Immigration Task Force of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, CAPAC, and I will continue to fight for the needs of families within the immigration debate.One of the major issues for the Filipino Americans and other Asian Pacific American communities is family reunification: allowing relatives of legal permanent residents, other than spouses and minor children, to immigrate legally and join their families. It can take the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) as long as 23 years to even consider an application for a family member from the Philippines.The extended family is a foundation in many of our cultures, and it provides real benefits to the greater society as well. Families often pool resources to educate children or purchase homes and establish roots in their communities. We often see extended family networks starting businesses, providing economic development and jobs. Congress must act to ensure that families who will contribute to American society are not punished by our immigration system.The treatment of Filipinos who fought with the United States Armed Forces in World War II is also an issue of great concern for Filipino Americans and a dark spot in American History. The Philippines became a United States possession after Spain ceded it as part of the treaty ending the Spanish-American War in 1898. In 1934, Congress created a 10-year time frame for independence through the ``Philippine Independence Act.'' However, since the Philippines remained a colonial possession until 1946 the United States retained the right to call upon military forces organized by the Philippine government into the United States Armed Forces.On July 26, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a military order that brought the Philippine Commonwealth Forces under the control of the United States Armed Forces during World War II. These men bravely fought with our own troops during the war, and many perished or suffered severe wounds from the battles in the western Pacific Theater. After the surrender of Japan, Congress required the Philippine Forces to continue service their service. Many helped occupy lands, many oversaw military operations, and many made the ultimate sacrifice to secure our victory in World War II. Yet, when wartime service ended formally in 1946 they did not receive the same benefits and the same treatment as other American soldiers.Yet, for all their heroic and courageous actions, Congress passed the ``Recession Act'' in February 1946. This essentially denied Filipino veterans any of the benefits that their American comrades in arms received, including full access to veterans' health care; service-connected disability compensation, non-service connected disability compensation, dependent indemnity compensation, death pension, and full burial benefits. No other group of veterans has been systematically denied these benefits. While we are nearly out of time to right this wrong this Congress, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the 111th Congress on ensuring Filipino veterans the benefits they deserve.Filipino Americans have enriched the fabric of America, and I am proud to celebrate Filipino American Heritage Month. I look forward to continuing to work with the Filipino American community to address the needs and concerns of Filipino Americans throughout the United States.",

The defense bill's purpose is to ensure that troops and their families needs are put first as they struggle to fight two wars.The needs of the Army are shortchanged in this amendment. The needs of the Army should be put first as the service carrying the heaviest burdens in the wars in progress. Readiness above all.Putting troops first involves making choices. As President Eisenhower said about ``the clearly necessary.''This amendment decreases pay benefits, health care for troops and their families, benefits that are clearly necessary by any measure, and puts hundreds of millions of dollars into corporate overhead.Hear me. Understand. You vote for this amendment, you're voting to cut funds for the troops and their health care and their families' to put it in corporate overhead accounts, and you're going to be held to account for it come November, guaranteed.The defense bill already provides $3.3 billion for this program. No more is needed for corporate overhead. The 5 percent reduction in the program that this amendment seeks to roll back has been reallocated. We reallocated funds for serious equipment shortfalls in the Army, National Guard, and Reserve. The equipment readiness needs of the Army, Guard, and Reserve take priority over corporate overhead any day. Understand, to pay for this amendment, you cut military pay, benefits, health care, and equipment for the National Guard and Reserve in multiple deployments.The choice could not be more clear. You are going to take funding from the troops and their families and give it to defense contractors who have already received over $15 billion. Defense contractors are well paid for their services. They do not come and their profits don't come before military families.The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Akin).",

It has been more than 120 years since his death on the Kalaupapa Peninsula on the island of Molokai, but Father Damien's life continues to illuminate for all humankind the pathway of service to the needy.Father Damien's mission in life and the journey he took to fulfill it were inspired by a simple yet profound compassion, to recognize the human rights and dignity of every individual, particularly those who were cast aside to Kalaupapa. He challenged the orthodoxies of his own church and the government to provide the needed resources to care for Hansen's disease patients who had been banished to Kalaupapa--attracting worldwide attention to his demonstration of humanity.He lived, worked, and died in geographic isolation with the people he cared for, but his timeless teachings and inspiration have reached a vast congregation that reaches around the world without regard to time and place. Father Damien's hope and devotion continue to strengthen all of us today, and his sainthood affirms this for eternity.I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and Father Damien's work and legacy, a timeless example of compassion and dedication.Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Chair, I rise today to oppose an amendment offered by Representative Flake to H.R. 3183, the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2010. This amendment would strike $3 million in funding from the Consortium for Plant Biotechnology Research located in Georgia.I support this funding because of the amazing progress CPBR funded projects have been able to make. CPBR receives a small amount of funding annually and in turn has a competitive selection process to fund projects that further plant biotechnology that impacts the seed, agrochemical, forestry, food, energy, electric power, and other nonfood agriculture-based industries.On average, federal funds to CPBR are matched 130 percent with non-federal funds. Industry must provide at least 50 percent cash matching, this requirement is not required by federal grants and goes to prove the worthiness of these CPBR projects and expedites their path to the marketplace. It is noteworthy that 372 CPBR-funded research projects have resulted in 129 patents, 67 patent applications pending, 274 licenses, and 5 start-up companies. In fact, CPBR-funded projects average 2.5 patents/$1 million of federal funding. This is significantly higher than the university rate of 0.13 patents/one million federal dollars, that's 1900 percent higher.In Hawaii, CPBR funded a professor at the University of Hawaii who developed a process called ``flash carbonization'' which is now patented and has been licensed to several companies including Kingsford. This process uses a large cylindrical reactor to pressurize and heat tires, green waste and municipal solid waste to make a ``biochar'' or charcoal that can be used to enhance soil or burn as a fuel. This technology has spawned two energy companies that are building new environmentally friendly industries and creating high paying jobs in Hawaii. This progress started with a small research grant from CPBR.CPBR supports higher-risk, longer-term environmental research that is essential to innovation, research that companies cannot afford to do on their own. With these federal funds, innovative advancements in environmental and energy research are hastened to the marketplace where they can be implemented. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment offered by Representative Flake and vote against its passage.",

    "text": "I could not take leave of the floor, Mr. Speaker, without mentioning the following:It is one thing for Representative Hastings or Young or Rahall or myself and others to take to the floor, but without staff support, it simply couldn't be done.Our friend, an institutional giant of the Resources Committee, Marie Howard, is retiring from the Natural Resources Committee. I want to commend her, not just for the work on this bill, but for all of the devotion that she has had to the House.Janet Erickson is taking her place as staff director for Indian Affairs.In addition to Marie and Janet, Rick Healy and Jim Zoia have been heavily involved in bringing this bill to the floor. Their efforts are deeply appreciated by everyone.Countless hours of staff time in the administration--both departmental and within the White House--have been put forward.As has been indicated, Mr. Speaker, this bill has passed out of the House Natural Resources Committee four times already. It has passed from the House floor twice under the leadership of as diverse a group of Chairs as Jim Hansen, Don Young, George Miller, and Nick Rahall. I note as well that the bill has passed under the leadership of Speaker Dennis Hastert and under the leadership of my good friend Tom DeLay. It is not ideological. It is nonpartisan. It is the culmination of a legislative lifetime for me, and it is the last occasion I will have to address the House as I take my leave.Mr. Speaker, I love this House. I admire and respect every Member. It has been a privilege for me to be first sworn in as the last person to be sworn in by Speaker Tip O'Neill. I take my leave today with profound respect, admiration and affection for every Member of this House of Representatives. This is the people's House. You can only enter it upon the fact of having been elected by your constituents. They have placed their faith and trust in us, and I extend my faith and trust that this House will continue the great tradition of democracy.I want to say to one and all that I love you, and I love this House.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2314, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2009 and a substitute amendment that I will offer on the House floor. This is legislation that the Hawaii Congressional delegation has been working on for more than 10 years and it is a privilege to see this progress through the legislative process as my time in Congress comes to an end.The purpose of the bill is to provide a process for the reorganization of the Native Hawaiian governing entity for the purposes of a federally recognized government-to-government relationship. The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act would provide Native Hawaiians the same right of self-governance and self-determination that are afforded to other indigenous peoples.Since Hawaii was annexed as a territory, the United States has treated Native Hawaiians in a manner similar to that of American Indians and Alaska Natives. This bill would formalize that relationship and establish parity in federal policies towards all of our indigenous peoples.I would also like to provide supporting documentation on the sections of H.R. 2314 primarily affected by the amendment in the nature of a substitute that I am offering on the House floor today. The following is additional language on Sections 3, 9 and 10.The definition of ``Native Hawaiian Membership Organization'' identifies organizations through which Native Hawaiians have sought to preserve their culture, native traditions, and self-governance. These organizations are an important (though not the exclusive) means through which Native Hawaiians have succeeded in maintaining their native traditions and culture, and given expression to their rights to self-determination and self-governance. Indeed, Congress has relied on such organizations to function as official representatives of the Native Hawaiian community in other statutory contexts. In the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, for example, Native Hawaiian organizations function as representatives of the Native Hawaiian community with respect to Native Hawaiian remains and funerary objects, just as federally-recognized Indian tribes represent their communities with respect to Indian remains and objects. See 25 U.S.C. Sec. 3001 et seq. The definition of ``qualified Native Hawaiian constituent'' identifies adult U.S. citizens who, subject to the procedures and provisions of Section 8 of the Act, will be eligible to participate in the initial reorganization of the Native Hawaiian governing entity. The definition of ``qualified Native Hawaiian constituent'' differs from similar definitions in prior versions of this legislation in that it requires not only descent from the aboriginal, indigenous, native inhabitants of Hawaii, but also maintenance of ``a significant cultural, social, or civic connection to the Native Hawaiian community.'' An individual must demonstrate this connection by satisfying at least two of the ten listed criteria, which include residence in Hawaii, residence on Hawaiian Homes Commission Act (HHCA) lands (or status as the child or grandchild of such a resident), eligibility to be a beneficiary of Hawaiian Homes Commission Act programs, status as the child or grandchild of a person with such eligibility, residence or ownership interest in ``kuleana land'' that is owned in whole or in part by a verified lineal descendant of the person who received original title to such land (or status as a child or grandchild of a person with such a residence or ownership interest), attendance for at least one school year at a school or program taught through the medium of the Hawaiian language or at a school founded and operated primarily or exclusively for the benefit of Native Hawaiians (or status as the child or grandchild of a person who attended such a program), membership in a Native Hawaiian organization, or recognition as Native Hawaiian and as the son or daughter of a person recognized as Native Hawaiian by other members of the Native Hawaiian community. The inclusion of these criteria will ensure that the persons who participate in the reorganization of the Native Hawaiian governing entity are persons with Native Hawaiian ancestry who have established ties to the Native Hawaiian community, as evidenced through, for example, connection to Native Hawaiian traditional lands, whether HHCA lands or kuleana lands, or a combination of residence in Hawaii and connections with Hawaiian-language schools or Native Hawaiian associations and organizations--both of which are means through which the Native Hawaiian community has sought to preserve and give expression to its culture and traditions. There is precedent for using associative factors such as kinship, land, and participation in native organizations in determining tribal membership. See, e.g., 25 CFR Sec. 83.7(b)(1)(vii) & (2)(iv) (including ``language'' and ``kinship organization[s]'' among the criteria the Department of the Interior considers in determining whether petitioning tribes can establish that they are a distinct native community). The last criterion, recognition as Native Hawaiian by the Native Hawaiian community, is also akin to criteria used to define membership in a native community in other contexts. See, e.g., 43 U.S.C. Sec. 1602(b) (Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (``ANCSA'')). The definition of ``qualified Native Hawaiian constituent'' will ensure that the persons who participate in that reorganization are appropriately connected to the Native Hawaiian community. Once the Native Hawaiian governing entity is reorganized, the United States will recognize and affirm the entity's inherent power and authority (akin to the inherent power and authority of any Indian tribe) to determine its own membership criteria, to determine its own membership, and to grant, deny, revoke, or qualify membership without regard to whether any person was or was not deemed to be a ``qualified Native Hawaiian constituent'' under this Act. Membership criteria set forth in the Native Hawaiian governing entity's organic governing documents should provide that membership is voluntary and can be relinquished, as is typically the case with Indian tribes.Section 9 affirms the inherent powers and privileges that will vest with the Native Hawaiian governing entity upon federal recognition, and clarifies the respective powers and immunities that this entity, the State of Hawaii, and United States will have during the interim period immediately following recognition but before the three sovereigns have negotiated a long-term agreement or agreements and enacted any implementing legislation. The demarcations of authority between the State, the new Native Hawaiian sovereign, and the United States are most appropriately determined by agreement between those three sovereigns, as provided for by section 9(c). Recognition of the Native Hawaiian sovereign is a necessary precondition to the development of such an agreement. Thus, it is necessary for Congress to provide, not only for the inherent authorities of the Native Hawaiian sovereign, but also for an interim set of rules to demarcate its authority from that of the State. Those interim rules will cease to have any effect once the three sovereigns have negotiated, and their legislatures have adopted, an agreed set of superseding rules.I would like to thank Chairman Rahall and the House Leadership for their assistance and support on this legislation. I ask my colleagues to advance the reconciliation process for the State of Hawaii by supporting my substitute amendment and final passage of H.R. 2314.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, in support of our substitute amendment, the amendment ensures that the Native Hawaiian governing entity will have the same governmental authorities and sovereign immunity of other native governments.The Abercrombie amendment, the substitute amendment, follows centuries of well-established Federal law. The amendment is supported by the National Congress of American Indians, the Alaska Federation of Natives and other tribal organizations. President Obama supports the substitute amendment, and I quote, ``as it adds important clarifications to craft a durable pathway forward.''Mr. Speaker, the amendment in the nature of a substitute further clarifies that pending negotiations and subsequent implementation legislation with that, the following will occur: There will be no Indian Country within Hawaii. The United States will not take land into trust nor restrict alien ability of land owned by the Native Hawaiian governing entity. The governing entity may not exercise certain powers and authorities such as jurisdiction over non-Native Hawaiian individuals without their consent. And the State of Hawaii will retain regulatory and taxation authority over Native Hawaiians and the Native Hawaiian governing entity.Mr. Speaker, the Native Hawaiian government reorganization does as follows: Establishes a process for the recognition of a single Native Hawaiian governing entity; establishes a U.S. office for Native Hawaiian relations in the Department of the Interior to consult with other Federal agencies and the State of Hawaii; establishes a Native Hawaiian interagency coordinating group; authorizes United States-State of Hawaii Native Hawaiian governing entity negotiations based on the following: the transfer of lands, natural resources and other assets; the exercise of governmental authority over any lands or resources; the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction; and grievances regarding assertions of historical wrongs committed against the Native Hawaiians by the United States or the State of Hawaii. It prohibits gaming by Native Hawaiian governing entities and Native Hawaiians. It prohibits the Native Hawaiian governing entity from being eligible for any new Indian programs to which they are not already included.Let me say then, in conclusion, what the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act does not do. It does not recognize the Native Hawaiian government upon passage of this bill. It does not exempt the Native Hawaiian government from any provision of the U.S. Constitution. It does not exempt the Native Hawaiian government from any provision of Federal law. It does not exempt the Native Hawaiian governing entity from taxation. It does not authorize a Native Hawaiian government entity to secede. It does not alter the civil or criminal jurisdiction of the United States or the State of Hawaii. And finally, it does not allow for the transfer of land or any authority of land to a Native Hawaiian governing entity.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, the Hawaii State Attorney General argues that granting the Native Hawaiian governing entity inherent powers could have an adverse impact on Hawaii, and I think that is the thrust, essentially, of the critique that has been made about the legislation this afternoon and this early evening.In response, Mr. Speaker, I would like to say to the Members, and to yourself, of course, that the current bill language gives the Native Hawaiian governing entity no powers that are currently exercised by other government entities until negotiated. This would prevent the entity from providing general assistance to its members or caring for a needy child, absent the amendment as a substitute.The substitute amendment resolves this by acknowledging certain inherent powers of the governing entity upon recognition, the same inherent powers that other native governments possess today; no more, no less. This is not, therefore, a radical notion. By definition, this is what Federal recognition does: It acknowledges that an entity is a quasi-sovereign tribal government. The acknowledged inherent powers of the entity are limited by language in the amendment, in the substitute amendment that states, and I quote: ``Nothing in this act shall preempt Federal or State authority over Native Hawaiians or their property under existing law.''Upon recognition, the entity will have no land akin to Indian country over which it could exercise jurisdiction. Since some inherent powers are tied to having such land, like certain regulatory authorities, the entity will not be able to exercise those powers.Finally, the negotiations process will further modify the powers and authority of the governing entity by virtue of the negotiation themselves.Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I request that those Members who have some trepidation about voting for the amendment in the nature of a substitute reflect that we believe, those of us who support it--and it was certainly my intention in offering the amendment to address those concerns in a positive way and in a legislatively viable way.I would ask at this time in closing, Mr. Speaker, that those Members who come to the floor to vote tonight consider voting for it, and I earnestly solicit the favorable attention of all members in voting for the amendment in the nature of a substitute.I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to my good colleague and friend, Mr. Hastings from Washington State, I have to oppose this amendment because it has no precedent--or indeed any place I believe in Federal law that has been in place for well over 150 years as that law relates to Native governments.Under our Constitution, the citizens of the United States are the only citizens who are authorized and recognized as having a right to have a say in the laws which govern our Nation, be they Federal statutes or amendments to our Constitution. In a similar manner, the citizens of one State in our Union do not get to weigh in on the laws of another State or any proposed amendments to another State's constitution. Put simply, they cannot vote for changes in the law of a State for which they are not citizens. It goes without saying that foreign governments have no role to play in the formulation of the laws of the United States or the U.S. Constitution.All of these fundamental principles have in their foundation the fact that each government is a separate sovereign, and only the citizens of that sovereign government may determine what governmental powers and authorities that sovereign government may exercise. It is no different for native governments in the United States.The largest native government in the United States is the Navajo Nation. It is situated in four States. Because they are not citizens of the Navajo Nation, the non-Navajo citizens of the States of Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado do not, under our constitutional principles, formulate, amend, or approve the governing documents either of the constitution or the laws of the Navajo Nation.In like manner, under our Federal statuary and constitutional framework, the non-Indian citizens of Washington State do not have the right to approve the constitution or the laws of the 28 Indian tribal governments in the State of Washington, nor do the citizens of any other State have the right, under our Federal Constitution or Federal laws, to approve the governing documents, the constitutions, of the native governments in their States if they are not citizens of the native government.I would suggest to my colleagues that they vote down the Hastings amendment on the basis that it is an inherent conflict of interest.If the gentleman's premise is that without regard to citizenship in a sovereign government, any citizen of the United States should have a right to vote to approve the organic governing documents of another sovereign government, then every American would have a right to determine the laws of every State in the Union. The citizens of Vermont could vote to amend the constitution of the State of California. The citizens of Utah could vote to legalize gaming in another State, even though the laws of Utah criminally prohibit all forms of gaming.This is counter to our constitutional family of governments in which each sovereign government and its citizens has the right to determine its own laws and be governed by those laws.I would suggest to my colleagues that to even take a step in this direction would create constitutional chaos in our Federal system as well as in the laws which govern each State and each Native government. This is not one of the fundamental principles on which this country was founded, nor does it have a place in our constitutional system of governments.",

    "text": "I will take the first few seconds of it, Mr. Speaker, because I believe this will be the last discussion of both the amendments and of the bill prior to voting, to thank Mr. Flake for his friendship over these years and to say to him that I admire his independent spirit; I admire his devotion to this House; I admire his steadfast sense of responsibility in the various amendments that he offers. I wish I could support it on the basis of that friendship and in my admiration for him.Yet I would like to say in that context--and I hope I am stating the purpose of the amendment correctly--that Mr. Flake wants to require any native governing entity to comply with the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution. If I had to summarize it in a sentence, that's the way I would put it.In the course of his remarks, he asked, Why not make sure? I think that's a perfectly reasonable request, but my contention would be, in asking that the amendment not be voted favorably upon, that precisely what he seeks to succeed in with his amendment is exactly what is in the bill, itself, which is in the amendment as a substitute. Mr. Flake's amendment then is duplicative of current Federal law.Only after a thoughtful and deliberate process did Congress impose most of the provisions on the Bill of Rights on tribes through the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968. The Equal Protection and Due Process provisions of the Bill of Rights were included verbatim in the Indian Civil Rights Act. The Indian Civil Rights Act specifically states, ``No Indian tribe in exercising the powers of self-government shall deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws or deprive any person of liberty or property without due process of law.''In section 1302, Constitutional Rights, again quoting, ``No Indian tribe in exercising powers of self-government shall:``No. 8: deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws or deprive any person of liberty or property without due process of law.''The Flake amendment essentially then ignores the provision of H.R. 2314, as amended, should we pass the substitute.The bill applies the Indian Civil Rights Act to the entity, the Native Hawaiian entity, and it requires the Secretary of the Interior to certify that the Native Hawaiian governing entity is in compliance with Federal law and that its governing documents provide for the protection of the civil rights of the citizens of the Native Hawaiian governing entity as well.Thus, the Flake amendment, as I indicated, I believe, is a duplication, and would actually create a double standard for the Native Hawaiian governing entity, not treating them as other federally recognized tribal governments are today.Finally, I believe the amendment could be subject to broad interpretation, the scope of which is unclear. As a result, litigation would likely flourish in the Federal courts, which might take years to resolve as the courts would have to examine the U.S. Constitution, Federal law and numerous Federal court decisions upholding the current law, which already imposes the same equal protection guarantees on tribes that Mr. Flake's amendment seeks to impose.Therefore, I ask, in the context of my admiration and respect for Mr. Flake, that his amendment, however, be defeated.With that, Mr. Speaker, if I have time remaining, I would like to take the occasion then to thank Mr. Hastings, Mr. Flake and all of those on the Resources Committee--Republican and Democratic alike--who have been my colleagues and friends all these years. I think the Resources Committee is one of the most unappreciated committees, unappreciated in the sense of comprehension by, perhaps, even Members of Congress and by the public at large. No committee deals with as detailed and as difficult a set of circumstances as the Resources Committee does. My respect and admiration for all its members abides with me as I take leave of the House.Mr. Speaker, ``aloha'' to you. ``Aloha'' to the House of Representatives. ``Aloha'' to all Members here tonight.",

The Native Hawaiian people have sought passage of this bill for ten years. The Hawaii State Legislature, which serves as the representative voice of Hawaii's people, has demonstrated continued commitment to Native Hawaiian self-governance and self-determination by unanimously affirming three separate resolutions supporting federal recognition of Native Hawaiians. Thank you for creating an atmosphere of dialogue with the various stakeholders. I appreciate your diligence and openness in working with the state administration and community constituencies to address the best approaches offered. I trust your judgment in this matter, and am confident that through your careful and thoughtful deliberations, we will have a measure that is worthy of the goals to which we have all aspired over the last ten years. I believe that the people of Hawaii recognize it is time to deliver a fair process for Native Hawaiians to resolve longstanding concerns in their community as other Native peoples have done. Federal recognition is an essential component in advancing the social and economic condition of Native peoples. To deny Native Hawaiians the rights of self- determination and self-governance as accorded to other Native peoples goes against the very principles of justice and fairness on which our country was founded. The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act provides an empowering and stable structure on which Native Hawaiians can build a prosperous future for themselves and for our state. Both our identity and the economic well-being of our state are very much intertwined with the well-being of the indigenous peoples of our island home. Effectuating a balanced process that will bring clarity to this issue is the right thing to do for our state, Native Hawaiians and all of the citizens of Hawaii. Sincerely, Calvin K.Y.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, the Government of Pakistan continues to assure our Government that it is a staunch ally of the United States. Last year, Pakistan illegally purchased M-11 missiles and 5,000 ring magnets from China. The M-11 missiles are capable of delivering a nuclear warhead and the ring magnets are used to enrich uranium, a key component for making nuclear bombs. Both transfers violate several U.S. nuclear nonproliferation laws.The latest destabilizing act by Pakistan appears to have occurred earlier this month when authorities in Taiwan seized the cargo of a ship loaded with 34.8 tons of chemicals traveling from North Korea to Pakistan. According to an article appearing in the March 10 edition of the United Daily News, a leading newspaper in Taiwan, the materials ``could be used for massively destructive purposes.'' The cargo, which Taiwanese authorities are holding, is being treated as top secret.The actions of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto are deeply troubling. Last year, Mrs. Bhutto travelled to North Korea. In addition, last year, Pakistan illegally purchased M-11 missiles from the People's Republic of China [PRC]. Earlier this year, news reports disclosed that Pakistan had 5,000 ring magnets from the PRC.Mr. Speaker, the administration is currently considering transferring $368 million worth of seized military hardware to Pakistan. The Congress granted that authority to the administration last year before it was aware of the seized cargo, the ring magnets, or the M-11 missiles. In light of these developments, it is imperative that the administration not proceed with the transfer. Tensions in South Asia are already very high. The United States needs to step back and reassess its position regarding Pakistan rather than continue on its present course.",

I would also like to very much associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished gentleman from Florida, Mr. Bilirakis, and commend him for arranging this special order. His leadership on issues of concern to Greek-Americans has been unmatched in Congress, and I'm proud to work with him on this and other important matters.Mr. Speaker, the world has changed greatly since 1821, but at least one common theme seems to link these two eras--the fight for democracy and freedom as a precious way of life for all people. It was a long and hard-fought battle in 1821 for Greece, and it continues to be one in 1996, in countries all over the world, from Asia, to Africa to Latin America. Greece, as the founder of democracy as we know it, however, has a special place in the hearts of all those who cherish democracy and freedom. In that respect, Greece and the United States have always shared a close relationship, which continues up to the present time, in the form of NATO, and other such alliances and ties. And it doesn't stop there. The contribution of Greece and Greek society to American society is immeasurable. Aside from the neo-classical architectural gems that grace our Capital City, Greek immigrants have been providing contributions to all facets of our society, from medicine to law to education and sports, just to name a few. In fact, one of the greatest contributions that Greece has made to the international community will be commemorated and celebrated this summer in Atlanta: the 100th anniversary of the modern Olympics.This of course is only a small token of expression of support for Greece and Greek-Americans, but it is something upon which I, and many Americans across this country and across all political spectrums, fervently hold forth. Simply put, without the democratic ideals that originated in ancient Greece, we would not have had an American Revolution. And without the contributions of Greek immigrants over the last 200 plus years, we simply would not have the America that we have today.",

Until recently, the tragic story of the 66th Infantry Division remained untold in U.S. history. These men made the ultimate sacrifice for their country and are worthy of a much greater tribute than the statistics or the footnotes in history books that have already been granted to them. As the worst troopship loss in World War II, and the third worst naval disaster in U.S. history, the story of the sinking of the Leopoldville deserves full recognition.On Christmas Eve, 1944, 2,235 American soldiers were crossing the English Channel as reinforcements to fight in the Battle of the Bulge, when their Belgian troopship, the Leopoldville, was torpedoed and sunk 5\\1/2\\ miles from Cherbourg, France. The result was a tremendous loss of lives--almost one-third of the division was killed. There were 493 bodies that were never recovered from the English Channel. Most of the soldiers who lost their lives were young boys, from 18 to 20 years old, barely out of high school. They represented 46 out of the 48 States that were part of the Union at the time.However, the most tragic and troubling part of this story is the American public's general ignorance of the facts. All of us, and particularly the family members of the lost soldiers, should be told the full story of their loved ones' valiant efforts in their fight to preserve democracy.Therefore, I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering and honoring those that gave their lives in protecting the ideals that all Americans cherish. I would also like to remind my colleagues that this story should hold a special place in ever State's history. Simply put, the 802 soldiers that lost their lives deserve the proper respect and remembrance for their sacrifice, and those that survived need to be recognized for their valor.",

While serving as deputy director of Queens community boards from 1985 through 1990, Honey used her expertise to help local boards address major, complex issues that impacted on the growth and development of the borough's many communities. While immersed in this ongoing role Honey developed a second field of expertise by becoming a professional volunteer. As a PTA leader, president of the Aviva chapter of B'nai Brith, a companion to children with emotional problems at the Creedmoor Hospital, a chairwoman of the adult-education program at the Marathon Jewish Center, a volunteer at the Queens County District Attorney's office, and a chauffeur for senior citizens at the Samuel Field Y, Honey Miller established a reputation as someone who could undertake any task and get the job done.Mr. Speaker, the community has not only benefited from Honey's dedication, but also has responded to her good works by presenting her with many and varied honors, including Woman of the Year for the northeast Queens Memorial Day parade, certificates of achievement from B'nai Brith and the Marathon Jewish Center, citation of achievement from the metropolitan region of the United Synagogue of America, the Community Service Award from the Glen Oaks Volunteer Ambulance Corp., and the certificate of merit from the Queens Women's Center.Fully understanding the workings of American government and responding in the true American spirit of voluntarism and civic participation, Honey has risen to a variety of prominent positions in the area of elected leadership. While currently serving as Democratic district leader for the 24th Assembly District, a position which she has held since 1972, Honey has also chaired the women's division of the New York State Democratic Committee, was treasurer of the Women's Executive Committee of the Queens County Democratic Organization, second vice chairperson of the Queens Democratic Committee, and served as delegate to the last five Democratic National Conventions.Mr. Speaker, Honey Miller has come to symoblize the truest example of the American participatory spirit.

Eighty-one years ago, while Europe was embroiled in war and the Ottoman Empire was crumbling, a concerted campaign to eradicate the Armenian people began. In the course of 8 brutal years, at least 1.5 million Armenian men, women, and children were massacred.What was the reason behind this deliberate and calculated effort to destroy any Armenian presence in Turkey? We will probably never know. The official Turkish Government position is that, during World War I, a series of internal conflicts contributed to the unfortunate deaths of many Armenians. In my opinion, that symbolizes a categorical denial of what really happened. It is the denial of an event that has been documented by scholars the world over. That denial is disrespectful to the memories of those that perished, those that survived, and to the civilized world. Quite simply, it is reprehensible. As a Jewish Member of Congress, and a human being, I cannot stand idly by while this denial continues to be perpetrated.It has been said that when Adolf Hitler was planning the Final Solution to the Jewish problem, he recalled the international reaction to the Armenian genocide: ``Who remembers the Armenians?'' he offered. In the same vein, who then would stand up for the Jews and remember them? Well, we do remember that Holocaust, as well as the innocent victims of the Armenian genocide, and we will continue doing so, that it may never happen again.The Armenian genocide was the first of the 20th century, but because the world did not learn its lesson, we were forced to endure the horrors of the Jewish Holocaust. Therefore, we have pledged, and stand together, as Jews, as Armenians, as people, that we will never allow this kind of tragedy to befall us again.I thank my colleagues, Congressmen John Porter and Frank Pallone, for leading this effort in the House of Representatives, and am proud to be a member of the Armenian Issues Caucus in order to work on this issue of concern to all human beings.",

Roger has long been a champion of family values, and he has utilized his tradition of leadership in this regard. To name but a few of these beneficial organizations, he was instrumental in launching the Beth-El Connection, a program dedicated to welcoming new families into the congregation, as well as the Family Life Program, a group devoted to strengthening the Jewish family.In fact, Roger's philanthropic activities extend far beyond the scope of the Jewish community to encompass the many faces of Long Island. He has been an active member of the Association for a Better Long Island. Furthermore, Roger has consistently been a strong supporter of the arts. It is his love of education and culture that led to the construction of the Tilles Center at Long Island University's C.W.

They have tirelessly strived to put an end to illegal dumping--a highly detrimental practice with far-reaching effects. Additionally, they have long tried to promote understanding of the causal link between environmental and physical health. In this vein, Virginia has served as the executive director of the New York State Northeast Queens Nature and Historical Preserve Commission, while Aurora has served as its commissioner. Furthermore, Virginia has spent the past 15 years on the Queens Borough president's Flushing Bay task force.Mr. Speaker, Virginia and Aurora have come to symbolize the American spirit of voluntarism and generosity. I ask all my colleagues to rise with the grateful people of the Fifth Congressional District in extending to Virginia Dent and Aurora Gareiss the highest accolades of appreciation and admiration.",

    "title": "IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 2579",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H.R. 2579, the Travel and Tourism Partnership Act of 1995. The tourism industry makes up an enormous part of our economy, and in fact, it is our Nation's second largest employer. This industry also generates a total of $58 billion in taxes for our Federal, State, and local governments annually. The revenue generated by travel and tourism has made it our nations leading export. Additionally, the revenue that's been generated by domestic and international tourists has helped to ease the tax burden for American households. In past years the U.S. tourism industry has grown, while enhancing the economic prosperity of communities and cities from across the Nation, resulting in secure jobs and thriving businesses.The travel industry has exploded worldwide, to the point where it now employs 10 percent of the global work force. And it continues to grow--at a rate 23 percent faster than the world's economy. In a competitive market like this, the United States cannot afford to fall behind in its attraction of world tourists. This was the impetus behind the establishment of the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration [USTTA]--the promotion of the United States for the international traveler, as well as for the tourist at home. The marketing techniques used by the USTTA allowed this nation to dominate and remain competitive in the world market.In April of 1996, however, USTTA was closed down in an effort to save money. However, the cost of our actions could be greater with the loss of some 177,000 jobs throughout the tourism industry, as well as the end of organized U.S. travel promotions efforts. Since 1993, there has been a huge decrease in international travelers inbound for the U.S., while at the same time, an increase in U.S. residents traveling abroad. The obvious result of these trends have led to a loss of revenue, a loss of jobs and a loss of our ranking in the world tourism industry. Clearly, since the closing of the USTTA our Nation has suffered a loss in tourism revenue while the rest of the world benefits in an increase in tourism.New York State alone generated $4.8 billion in tax revenue collected from international and domestic tourists, in 1993. Along with the revenue generated, there are 357,000 New York jobs that are supported by these tourists. Obviously, the tourism industry is an important source of revenue for the State of New York, collecting 11 percent of the $58 billion generated in the United States overall from the international traveler.Simply put, we need to attract international tourists back to the beautiful sites our country has to offer, while steering them toward use of U.S. companies. This is why I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2579--already cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 246 Members--to establish a U.S. National Tourist Organization. The organization will advise the President and Congress on policies that will increase U.S. competitiveness in the global arena, in the hopes of alluring the international tourist to the United States, and the American tourist back home.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend Dr. L. Eudora Pettigrew, who has just completed 10 years of service as president of the State University of New York College of Old Westbury. Dr. Pettigrew has served with distinction as head of the State University of New York's most diverse and multicultural campus. During her long career in higher education, both as a faculty member and as an administrator, Dr. Pettigrew has earned the respect of students, faculty, and alumni. Prior to her stewardship of SUNY College of Old Westbury, President Pettigrew served as associate provost of the University of Delaware. During her outstanding career, she has also been associated with such distinguished institutions as Michigan State University, Southern Illinois University, and the University of Bridgeport.President Pettigrew received her doctor of philosophy degree and master's degree from Southern Illinois University. She holds a bachelor of arts degree from West Virginia State College. While fiscally the past decade has been a difficult one for almost all segments of our society, higher education--particularly public higher education--has endured painful budget reductions which continue to this day. Yet, President Pettigrew, through resourceful and courageous leadership, has successfully guided her campus through these very troubled times. And each spring, in a spectacular and very moving right of passage, SUNY Old Westbury holds a commencement ceremony unmatched on Long Island. Nearly 1,000 men and women of all ages, of remarkably different ethnic religious and racial backgrounds receive their diplomas from President Pettigrew. No where else on Long Island or in SUNY can one witness such a wonderful example of successfully bringing people from a broad spectrum of backgrounds together to learn from and with each other and, ultimately to succeed. Such wonderful diversity lies at the core of the success of the College at Old Westbury and President Pettigrew has played a major role in preserving the College at Old Westbury's very special and unique mission.International education has been a long-standing interest of Dr. Pettigrew. She has traveled worldwide to participate in conferences and symposia which involve discussions about the expansion of international education programs on campuses throughout the world. Recently she led a delegation of public university presidents from throughout the United States to the People's Republic of China. The chancellor of the State University of New York has appointed her chair of a special Commission on Africa with primary focus on South Africa. She recently led a delegation of SUNY officials to South Africa to explore the possibility of exchange programs with South African universities.Mr. Speaker, President L. Eudora Pettigrew is an extraordinary educator and dynamic leader who has contributed most significantly to the growth and development of the State University College at Old Westbury over the past decade. She is an educator extraordinaire and I am very pleased to publicly acknowledge her many works on behalf of the citizens of New York State. I call on my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in paying tribute to a dedicated educator and extraordinary humanitarian, Dr. L. Eudora Pettigrew.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 22nd Anniversary of Turkey's illegal occupation of the island of Cyprus on July 20, 1974. The Turkish military invasion resulted in an involuntary division of this once harmonious Mediterranean state. Greek residents in northern Cyprus have since suffered innumerable restrictions on freedom and human rights at the hands of their Turkish invaders and more than 35,000 Turkish troops continue to occupy the northern portion.The effects of this invasion has included the deaths of more than 6,000 Greek-Cypriots, the displacement of over 200,000 refugees from towns and communities once occupied by their ancestors, and the capture of thousands more. Sadly, 1619 people, including five Americans, are still missing today.The current situation in Cyprus is of great importance to the United States and specifically the Greek-American community. Members of Congress have finally begun taking steps to ensure that this illegal and inhumane state of affairs is resolved peacefully. The Clinton Administration has also turned its attention to Cyprus, demonstrating with Congress a joint commitment to demilitarizing this divided island.Today, we not only commemorate the anniversary of this invasion, but remind America that the injustices created by Turkey's military aggression are as pervasive today as they were 22 years ago. The enclaved Greek population, living within the Turkish occupied zone, live without many of the rights and privileges implicit within a democratic society, and will continue to do so until Turkey's military presence is no more.I commend Mr. Bilirakis in holding this very important Special Order, and I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering the Turkish invasion of Cyprus as well as continue to support efforts being made to end this wrongful occupation, so that we may one day commemorate the restoration of Cyprus to a peaceful, harmonious and united nation.",

    "title": "ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997",
    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the fiscal year 1997 energy and water appropriations bill and in particular the provision of $250,000 to begin the feasibility portion of the coastal erosion study on the North Shore of Long Island. I want to thank the distinguished chairman, the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Myers], as well as the distinguished gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Bevill], for their assistance in providing this funding for the North Shore.Mr. Chairman, the North Shore has a considerable history of tidal flooding, shore erosion, and damage to shorefront development. Hurricanes affecting the area occurred in 1938, 1944, 1954, and 1960. In addition, tropical storms occurred in the area in 1950, 1953, 1955, 1962, and in 1992. Recent coastal storms have caused shoreline erosion resulting in storm damage to several communities, including Bayville in Nassau County and the Village of Asharoken in Suffolk County. The December 1992 Nor'easter inundated hundreds of residential and business properties with damages estimated at $12 million. In addition, approximately 300 people were evacuated, and sections of Bayville, the village of Asharoken and Eatons Neck were impassable for days.So far this year we have been lucky. There have been several severe storms in the northeast with some flooding but none has resulted in the extensive damage caused by the '92 Nor'easter. It is probably only a matter of time.In September last year, the Army Corps of Engineers completed the reconnaissance study of the North Shore which found that, based on a general assessment of coastal flooding and beach erosion, the area is particularly susceptible to storm damage and that the villages of Bayville and Asharoken typify the flooding and erosion problems in the study area.Finally, the study recommended that further feasibility studies for beach erosion control and storm damage reduction be conducted in order to formulate the most appropriate plan for any proposed storm damage protection project.The Federal interest in the North Shore is well documented. The Army conducted a study of hurricane damage to coastal and tidal areas in response to series of hurricanes in 1954.In 1963, the Army began a study of beach erosion and hurricane protection which was completed in 1969. Clearly the area has been much studied. It is time to move beyond identifying the problem to designing the solution.Last year's report identified two plans for Bayville and two for Asharoken both of which have positive benefit to cost ratios. The plans for Bayville use a combination of features including a buried seawall, a composite bulkhead/revetment and floodwalls. The plans for Asharoken use a combination of buried seawall and beach nourishment to provide erosion control and flood protection. The report went on to note that ``a feasibility study having a greater level of detail is required to formulate the most appropriate plan for any proposed storm damage protection project.''Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that the Subcommittee saw fit to include funding for the next phase of the North Shore feasibility study. Now we can identify the solution to the North Shore's longstanding erosion problem.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise on the floor of the Congress to commend a great American, John Powell, who is assisting the Jewish National Fund in their efforts to bring trees to the land of Israel. I may also note, with some trepidation, that John serves as the highly effective chairman of the Suffolk County Republican Committee. Throughout his career, he has displayed a strong commitment to his community, and has gained the utmost respect from local leaders on both sides of the partisan divide. Moreover, John's career underscores how much one person can accomplish through a disciplined work ethic.John Powell moved to Long Island when he was 11-years-old and graduated from Patchogue-Medford High School in 1978. While attending Suffolk Community College, John held two gas station jobs to help pay for his education. He also volunteered with the Brookhaven Republican Party, stuffing envelopes and making phone calls. These early experiences helped establish his strong work ethic, and commitment to public service. John eventually was recommended for a job with the Brookhaven Town Highway Department where he was quickly promoted to being an executive assistant to Highway Superintendent Harold Malkmes. Once again, John's hard work and dedication helped him rise to meet new challenges.In 1988, John was elected to the New York State Assembly. He brought his unique, blue collar perspective to the halls of the New York State Capitol. After a year in Albany, John felt the need to return to his community. He ran for Brookhaven town council and won handily. During his tenure on the council, John became intricately involved in Brookhaven town matters. In 1991, John became the Brookhaven town Republican leader. By 1995, he rose to the chairmanship of the Suffolk County Republican Committee, where he has served with honor and distinction. He now lives in the town of Medford with his wife Linda, and their three children, Alexandria, John, and Anthony.John often works closely with the county executive to solve some of Long Island's most complex problems. His perseverance and dedication to the community have gained recognition across New York State. More importantly, he has used his own life experiences toward the betterment of others.John has also championed the ideal of an inclusive community. In this spirit, he has consistently worked alongside the Jewish community in Suffolk County. It is only appropriate that John Powell be involved with the Jewish National Fund.The Jewish National Fund is helping rebuild the land of Israel through afforestation, housing, and agricultural projects. Moreover, this organization constructs dams and reservoirs, provides employment and promotes Zionist education. The JNF is literally transforming a once arid dessert into a lush, agricultural community. This year, the JNF will help celebrate Jerusalem's 3,000th anniversary by developing new projects throughout the city. These include a new Parks and Events Center, a Children's Garden and Educational Center, and the completion of the greenbelt around Jerusalem.John is now being honored by the JNF at their Tree of Life Award dinner dance. As an honoree, he will help the JNF raise much needed funds for environmental projects in both Israel and around the world. His actions today will be appreciated for generations to come. John's commitment to the Jewish National Fund epitomizes a lifetime of dedication to worthwhile causes. His distinguished career should serve as a model for us all.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 142, regarding human rights in Mauritania. This resolution highlights an issue that should sadden and anger all Americans. Indeed, the entire world should be outraged.One would have thought that at the close of the 20th century, slavery would have been consigned to the history books, a painful reminder of our own ignorance and inhumanity. Instead, we are confronted with the appalling institution of slavery alive and well.The evidence seems clear that slavery exists in both Mauritania and Sudan, which is why I find the public comments of our Ambassador to Mauritania, as well as the relatively weak reference to slavery in Mauritania in the recent Human Rights Country Report to be especially troubling. The United States should not be down-playing slavery. We should be raising our opposition to slavery at every possible opportunity.Mauritania is violating international law by tolerating the existence of slavery and is violating its own domestic laws. There seems to have been little effort by the government of Mauritania to stop this abhorrent practice, since the government makes no effort to inform people of their rights and does not prosecute those who continue to hold slaves.Mr. Speaker, by adopting this resolution today, the House will send a strong signal to the Government of Mauritania that more must be done to wipe out the scourge of slavery as well as its vestiges.I urge all my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution 142.",

Imbued at home at an early age with a strong responsibility to serve both individuals and the community, Rabbi Ehrlich received his formal preparation at the Ramaz School and went on to study in a joint program at Colombia University and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. He was ordained in 1968.Before coming to the Oakland Jewish Center, Rabbi Ehrlich served at the Conservative Synagogue on Fifth Avenue and as a teacher and principal at the Jewish Center of Bayside Hills. He has been involved in religious and secular training since 1964 and recently retired from the New York City school system after more than a quarter-century of dedicated service.Rabbi Ehrlich has these many years emerged as a distinguished spiritual leader, an educator and community servant. In all his endeavors he has demonstrated an unique ability to bring people of all beliefs together into a common bond to create that which is both beneficial, supportive and comforting to our community. The tribute from his congregation is a tribute to us all.Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join with me and my colleagues, and rise in honor of this man, who has meant so much to his community, Rabbi Michael Ehrlich.",

Moreover, this important organization works with the Suffolk County Department of Health Services to provide yearly mammograms at St. Hughes of Lincoln Church in Huntington Station. The success of this independent, grassroots organization has been studied around the world. In fact, the Huntington organization has inspired the creation of the Tokyo Breast Cancer Action Coalition.The coalition was created on October 12, 1992, by a group of women led by Karen Miller, who cared deeply about the high rate of breast cancer in their community and had been affected personally by this most serious condition. These women educated their families, friends, and neighbors about various prevention and early detection measures. By 1993, the organization had opened administrative offices. Today, the Huntington Breast Cancer Action Coalition has 1,500 active volunteers, each of whom is committed to putting an end to this serious condition. The organization has sent a woman's breast health survey to 68,000 households throughout Huntington. So far, they have compiled 26,000 responses in their computer data base. The coalition eventually wants to use these findings to help determine the cause of the high rate of breast cancer in Huntington. At a dinner on October 1, the coalition will honor the following members who truly demonstrate the selflessness and compassion of an entire organization.Michael Miller, who is the husband of the founder of the coalition, has been an outstanding leader in our fight against breast cancer.

In fact, to my knowledge, it's the only town in the country so affected.The bill generally grandfathers all communities in New York and other States which have actually designated waste management facilities pursuant to duly enacted State and local legislation. The single exception to this situation is the section entitled ``Facilities Not Qualified for Flow Control'' incorporated into the bill.This section provides that flow control may not be exercised with regard to any facility if the following conditions are met:The ordinance was determined to be unconstitutional by a State or Federal court prior to May 16, 1994, and before the date of enactment of the legislation;The facility is located over a sole source aquifer and within 1 mile of a coastal zone; andThe facility is not fully permitted and operating in compliance with Federal, State, and local regulations.As I understand it, the bill was further modified in this extraordinary process to ensure that it applied only to facilities within 5 miles of a public beach and 25 miles of a city with a population of 5 million or more. Clearly a reference to New York City.By its terms, the provision applies to only a single town in the State of New York: North Hempstead. It would not apply to neighboring towns such as Hempstead, Babylon, or Islip, although waste disposal conditions are virtually identical in these towns and the need to manage solid waste is similar. Only North Hempstead would be denied authority to utilize its flow control ordinance in support of a waste management plan.On its face the bill is unfair. North Hempstead meets the conditions set out in the bill for other towns to take advantage of flow control yet the amendment would deny North Hempstead this authority for no legitimate reason.The bill will shift from waste companies to residential taxpayers much of the approximately $10 million annual cost of furnishing waste management services. By denying flow control authority to North Hempstead, the bill will threaten the fiscal solvency of the town because the tipping fees currently generated by the town's flow control ordinance are utilized for the following: $6 million per year for debt service on property purchased by the town's solid waste management authority for an incinerator project which was not constructed; $60 million over several years for remediation of landfills in Port Washington, NY, one of which is a Superfund site and the other which requires closure under Federal environmental regulations; and $6 million in construction cost for a new solid waste transfer station.The loss of flow control authority for North Hempstead is particularly egregious in view of the fact that the villages which would benefit utilized the town landfill for 40 years, and should thus bear some of the remediation costs which are now being paid for with flow control tipping fees.Mr. Speaker, it is because of provisions such as this that the bill should have been considered by committee and should not have come to the floor under suspension of the rules.Mr. Speaker, flow control authority is crucial to cities and towns across the country. So I hope that as we go to conference with the Senate, this onerous provision will be dropped, providing flow control to all the municipalities that need it.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring to the attention of the American people a potentially ominous situation for a region of the world to which the United States attaches great importance. It has always been in the interests of the United States to promote a balance of power in the Middle East and the peaceful flow of oil in the Persian Gulf. Stability and security has always been in the interests of our allies in the region as well and for the last 50 years has generally been a high priority in the execution of American foreign policy.However, the recent sale of advanced cruise missiles by the People's Republic of China [PRC] to Iran is a threat to that same stability and flies directly in the face of American nonproliferation efforts. I highlight this sale, and emphasize its possibly destabilizing effects, for my colleagues and all Americans for several reasons.First, the sale of these weapons by China is a blatant violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime [MTCR], a global accord that was enacted in the hope of halting the spread of advanced missiles around the globe. With this recent weapons sale, China has clearly violated the agreement.The repercussion of this sale in the region is undeniable. Iran's purchase of these weapons gives it the possibility of dramatically influencing, and potentially gaining control of, the gulf's important and lucrative shipping lanes--something Iran has sought for 17 years. There is no doubt that we must take this sale for what it is--an attempt by Iran to gain hegemony over the distribution of the region's valuable oil reserves. Iran's violent and aggressive recent past cannot allow us to be deceived into thinking that these weapons are to be used for any other but offensive purposes. This is pure and simple an offensive threat to both our, and the region's, commercial shipping industry. Our interest in the region, and our past expense of resources to defend those interests, dictate the importance of not overlooking this recent action. We must ensure that the potential for any increased peaceful trade, due to the Middle East peace process, not be disrupted. We cannot allow the promise of a bright economic future for the Middle East and the Persian Gulf suffer at the hands of the despotic rulers in Iran. To counter that, I have recently cosponsored legislation that would deeply affect Iran's ability to do business and I strongly urge all my colleagues to do the same. These proposed economic sanctions will show that the United States has no intention of abandoning the gulf region to the terroristic whims of Iran's mullahs.",

Cuba's action is inexcusable and is, as Ambassador Albright said, ``cowardice''.Brothers to the Rescue is a private group engaged in the humanitarian mission of plucking Cuban rafters out of the shark infested waters of the Florida Straits. The Brothers were on another such humanitarian mission last Saturday, in international airspace, when the Cuban Government scrambled two MiG fighters to intercept the three Cessnas. With only the vaguest of warnings, the fighters locked onto the small planes and blasted them from the sky leaving only oil slicks on the water below.Mr. Speaker, such wanton disregard for international law cannot go unanswered, so the response to this appalling attack has been swift. The U.N. Security Council has condemned the Cuban actions, as has the European Union, the President has suspended charter air travel and will ask Congress to use some of the $100 million in frozen Cuban assets to compensate the families of the victims. In addition, the conferees yesterday reached agreement on H.R. 927, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act. These steps, taken together, will dramatically increase the pressure on the Castro regime.Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in condemning the shooting down of civilian planes and to continue our work for a free and democratic Cuba.",

Last summer, Supinda organized a conference in Korea to discuss the challenges of globalization in the 21st century. She brought 268 students together from 67 universities around the world. Professors, policy experts, corporate leaders, and the media also attended the conference to give their own unique perspective on the challenges that lie ahead. As a leader of Harvard University's Project for Asian and International Relations, Supinda invited speakers and corporate sponsors, recruited delegates and managed the logistics of the event. Additionally, she raised $200,000 in donations to help financially challenged students attend the conference.Such initiative and intellectual endeavor can be seen throughout Supinda's experience at Harvard. She helped establish a forum on children's health at the Harvard School of Government and created the curriculum for an after-school project for underprivileged youth. Supinda has also traveled to Chile to conduct biological research.Supinda is one of 20 college students from around the country to be selected as a member of the All-USA College Academic First Team. Twelve hundred fifty-three students from all 50 states and the District of Columbia were nominated for this honor.Supinda will graduate with a degree in environmental science and public policy and would eventually like to become a college professor. Supinda's experience demonstrates how one individual can achieve so many extraordinary accomplishments through innovation, creativity, and leadership.

Anton, Jr.When describing Karl Anton, one usually says, ``He has ink in his blood.'' This healthy dose of printer's ink was given to him by his father, who published a community paper in Freeport, as well as the Nassau News. It very soon became the family tradition to both report and create history. As Karl became more involved with his father's journalistic efforts, the concept of community service took hold and very soon merged with his dedication to publishing. What resulted were newspapers that served to both enhance and inform the community. Many of today's Long Island newspapers have greatly benefited from contact with Karl Anton.Karl is indefatigable in all he undertakes and successful in all his endeavors. The intimate knowledge of the community gained by Karl through his newspapers generated a sense of duty to the various neighborhoods he covered. Very quickly he became a multifaceted workman devoting his knowledge and skills to a variety of community organizations and projects.Karl Anton's involvement in the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation came about when his oldest granddaughter, Christine, was diagnosed with the illness. Since then, a second daughter, Mary, was similarly diagnosed. Much to the great love and dedication of Karl, these children have been blessed with a compassionate, selfless and dedicated grandfather who has devoted his total self in aiding the search for a cure.Mr. Speaker, at a time when we search for heroes to lead us by dint of personality and hard work, we have been blessed with such a man as Karl Anton. I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me now in saluting Karl Anton for a lifetime of selfless contribution to his community.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join in recognition of the 176th anniversary of the independence of Greece.Greek Independence Day, which is celebrated in a variety of ways nationwide, commemorates the birth of modern Greece. Whether the festivities take the form of parades, dances, songs, or feasts, the common thread of freedom runs through all activities. The battle for liberty fought by the Greeks ended with the triumph of democracy. This struggle has significant relevance for the United States. Sacrificing for the principle of democracy is a fundamental value Greece and the United States share.The commemoration of Greek Independence Day also represents the special relationship between Greece and the United States. The bond reaches back to the early 19th century when Americans went to aid Greece in their war of independence. Now, approaching the 21st century, we're embarking upon a reinvigorated alliance. Sharing in the NATO partnership and working toward a sustained peace in the Balkans are two prominent examples of this relationship.Another praiseworthy element exemplified by Greek Independence Day is community involvement. In the United States, Greek-Americans make invaluable contributions to the cultural, educational, and social fabric of American society. As a lifelong New Yorker, I know firsthand about the robust civic spirit the Greek-American community embodies. The hard work demonstrated by the many volunteers to put the Greek Independence Day celebrations together represents this strong sense of community. All members of the Greek community should be very proud of the multiplicity of events celebrating Greek Independence Day.I want to thank my colleague from Florida, Mr. Bilirakis, for organizing this special order to celebrate Greek Independence Day. We should take this moment to salute the heroic feats of Greeks in their struggle for independence, recognize the strong bonds that exist between the United States and Greece, and applaud the contribution Greek-Americans make to communities across the country.",

    "title": "FRANCHISE BILL OF RIGHTS",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am calling to the attention of the Congress today legislation that I have introduced which would ensure that franchisees be guaranteed their fair and equitable rights for the franchises that they have developed through extraordinary work and sacrifice. Our main streets through out America are populated by a wide variety of franchises today. They are a significant component of businesses for working families and in middle-income communities. These businesses are also threatened due to the inequitable balance of power between the franchisee and franchisor.Franchisors should not be allowed to simply pull the rug out from under franchisees who have been working diligently and successfully in promoting the parent company's product. Some value must be assigned to the years of hard work, expertise, and equipment that has been invested in the franchise business. Current law, both at the State and Federal level, does not sufficiently address this problem.The current crisis facing the Canada Dry and Coors distributors in the New York metropolitan area is a very clear illustration of this problem and over 300 jobs could be lost for our region if the rights of franchisees are not protected. After building up distribution routes for Canada Dry and Coors over many years, and investing up to $250,000 per distribution route to buy the equity rights to their franchises, these distributors now face the termination of their livelihoods. The parent companies in New York have now taken the position that the distributors own nothing, despite their prior commitment to the distributors that they had equity ownership. The distributors deserve much of the credit for making these routes more profitable. This legislation would make it unlawful for franchise companies to sell franchises and distributorships, and then take back those franchises without fair compensation.Franchises employ more than 8 million people nationwide, and account for more than 35 percent of U.S. retail sales. Current trends suggest this explosion will continue, providing a certain urgency to our cause to correct inequities and unfair trade practices sooner, rather than later.Many issues deserve exploration such as proper disclosure by franchisors and parent companies. Our basic goal, however, should be to prevent unfair practices that do not properly recognize or compensate for the equity ownership rights that many franchisees and distributors have in their franchises, and ultimately devalue franchising as a successful way of conducting business.",

Theirs was a romance that began in elementary school and flourished through the years.Blanche was born in New York City, matriculated at Hunter College and graduated with an accounting degree in 1940. She was a selfeffaciing person who was comfortable with heads of state whom she met with Lester, and as well was always sensitive to the needs of those less fortunate than her. During World War II she volunteered for the security detail at the LaGuardia airport control tower. Never one to pursue her own place in the spotlight, she was the doting parent of Diane and Bruce and glorified in their careers as well as Lester's.Blanche held strong views in the area of human rights and she used for good purpose the influence that her position allowed. She was an active participant in ORT, Hadassah, Association to Help Retarded Children and the NAACP. She truly exemplified American womanhood: A modern woman who grew with the times, but one who never forgot her heritage or her principles.This land of ours is better for Blanche; its loss is even greater.I have lost a constituent.

On this day, in 1915, over 200 Armenian leaders were systematically massacred by the Turkish Government. Yet these horrific murders were only a precursor to the brutality and aggressiveness that would follow. In just 8 years, over 1.5 million Armenian men, women, and children were murdered and an entire population was faced with annihilation. I stand today, not only to acknowledge and remember the horrors of this tragic event but to denounce the government of Turkey for their denial of these historically documented truths. The official position of the Turkish Government is that, during World War I, a series of internal conflicts contributed to the unfortunate deaths of many Armenians. This claim shamefully ignores the premeditated murder of these people. As Members of Congress and as human beings, it is our responsibility to defend the memories of those who needlessly suffered. We must preserve the dignity of lives destroyed by the cruelty of a government. Their plight deserves remembrance and the world deserves the truth. The Turkish Government's refusal to acknowledge the Armenian genocide is disgraceful and I find it to be an injustice, which should not be tolerated under any circumstances. It is essential to recognize the devastation that was incurred by ignoring the Armenian genocide and allowing such horrors to reoccur through the Holocaust. We remember the trauma befallen upon the Jews and we must now stand up for the suffering forced upon millions of Armenians. The world can no longer refute history. Instead we must come together as Armenians, as Jews and as human beings to guarantee that no person shall ever endure such pain again. I thank my colleagues, Congressman John Porter and Congressman Frank Pallone, for leading this effort in the House of Representatives, and am proud to be a member of the Armenian Issues Caucus in order to work on this issue of concern to all human beings.",

This week, he will receive the first Gilbert Tilles Lifetime Achievement Award, in recognition of Mr. Koeppel's ongoing sponsorship of the annual Tilles Center engagement of the New York City Opera National Company. Beginning next fall, a Tilles Center Scholarship Award will be made annually in honor of Adolph and Rhoda Koeppel to encourage the development of young artists and of new audiences for the arts.Adolph Koeppel's devotion to the cultural life of Long Island is matched by his dedication to his profession. As the founding partner of Koeppel Martone Leistman and Herman, Mr. Koeppel has emerged as a leading tax certiorari attorney, and has gained wide recognition for his legal prowess among those practicing law in New York, the District of Columbia, and Florida. Indeed, Mr. Koeppel has established a reputation that readily emerges as a yardstick by which countless future legal efforts must be measured. His published works are voluminous and are used by practitioners as guideposts to addressing complex tax-law issues.Mr. Speaker, there are few individuals with a career so intense and demanding as Adolph Koeppel's who can readily take a hobby and make it into a second career. Yet Adolph Koeppel has turned his love of philately into a professional endeavor. He has produced four books on the tax revenue stamps of India, and will soon be publishing a fifth volume that will serve as the definitive work on Italian fiscal stamps.Yet of all his accomplishments and achievements in a career so diverse and time-consuming, Adolph Koeppel's personal achievements are his crowning success. He and his wife, Rhoda, are the parents of two exceptional daughters, Pamela and Lesley, who have in turn blessed the Koeppels with three granddaughters, Melissa, Jennifer, and Tara.Mr. Speaker, it is at a time such as this, when our country eagerly searches for heroes who readily bring forth those strong values so endearing and meaningful, that we are enriched by Adolph Koeppel's enormous contributions of leadership, scholarship, and family love.

These illnesses are among the fastest growing health concerns in our country and constitute a large and neglected area in medical research. Chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome [CFIDS] and fibromyalgia syndrome [FMS] are illnesses which affect at least a half million American adults and children. It is imperative that increased funding for research for CFIDS and FMS be approved in a timely fashion.CFIDS is a serious and complex illness that affects nearly every aspect of an individual's life. It is characterized by incapacitating fatigue, neurological problems and numerous other symptoms. Approximately 1,000 individuals in Suffolk County alone suffer from this disease. One of my constituents, named Anthony Wasneuski, was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1990. Mr. Wasneuski was a furniture salesman in New York City. He was also an accomplished artist who received a scholarship from the Brooklyn Museum. Unfortunately, because of this illness he must now remain at home, and now has difficulty even signing his own name. Mr. Wasneuski's story represents a real life experience behind the cold numbers and statistics of this debilitating disease.Fibromyalgia syndrome is a chronic, widespread musculoskeletal pain and fatigue disorder for which the cause is unknown. Research studies have indicated that approximately 2 percent of the general population are afflicted with FMS. The majority of FMS patients are female and symptoms may begin in young, school-aged children. Tragically, it takes approximately 3 years and costs thousands of dollars just to receive a diagnosis of the disease.Chronic fatigue immune dysfunction system and fibromyalgia clearly affect people from all walks of life. As the 1998 appropriations process gets underway, we need to focus upon ways that we can provide more research funding for these debilitating conditions.Mr. Speaker, I would also like to take the opportunity to thank my colleague, Mr. Forbes, for organizing this opportunity to speak out on chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome [CFIDS].I would like to take this opportunity to talk about a little known but devastating disease: CFIDS. Once dismissed by doctors, this syndrome is now being taken seriously. Studies vary on how many people are affected by this disease but a conservative estimate is about 390,000 adult cases in the United States.In the tristate area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, approximately 4,094 to 11,000 people have CFIDS.CFIDS is truly a terrible disease. It ranges in severity from patients who are just able to maintain a job, and may have to give up other aspects of their lives, to those who are bedridden and unable to take care of themselves.While CFIDS traditionally affects young women in the prime of their lives, a growing number of children appear to have CFIDS. The fact that this disease is striking young children is particularly disturbing. This disabling illness will have a disastrous effect on the economy by preventing young children from becoming income-earning, tax-paying citizens.While CFIDS is not known to be a killer, it has no proven treatment and no cure. Moreover, it is difficult and, unfortunately, nearly impossible to get a timely and correct diagnosis.Because patients go to many different doctors to find a diagnosis, they often are subjected to unnecessary, costly, and potentially harmful treatments.Mr. Speaker, this must change. Doctors, medical professionals, and those who are entering the medical fields must be educated about CFIDS. Delaying diagnosis is not only harmful to the patient, it is not cost effective. Treating individuals early in the disease process offers more promise for return to normal and productive living.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with my constituents and the countless citizens who have enjoyed and benefitted from the unique, insightful, educational, and entertaining programs of the Queens Museum of Art as this great cultural institution celebrates its 25th year of service.Originally conceived as the Queens County Art and Culture Center in 1972, the museum is located in the only building to serve as a pavilion at both the 1939 and 1964 World's Fairs. Since this early date, the Queens Museum of Art has grown into an institution that has become a mainstay of New York City's culture. Under the inspired leadership and support of dedicated community leaders and supporters of the arts, the museum has grown into an effective showcase for fulfilling its mission statement to show and collect the best of art, architecture and design from Queens in the 20th century.I look forward to sharing with the members and supporters of the museum their great joy as they gather together on May 20, 1997 to celebrate this unique achievement. It also to the great credit of the museum that they have sought out key individuals who are not only community leaders, but strong supporters of the arts as they honorees. Joan Barnes, owner of London Lennie's Restaurant and Joseph Ficalora, president of the Queens County Savings Bank are this years honorees. In addition, the well known artist, Alex Katz, will be the recipient of the museum's 1997 Arts Achievement Award.John Adams, our second President, indicated that he studied war and politics so that his children may study art and music. It is with such commitment that the Queens Museum of Art has succeeded in bring to our area a love, understanding and devotion of art.Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join with me in honoring the Queens Museum of Art, and in wishing the museum and its supporters continued success in all their future endeavors.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I wanted to take this opportunity to bring to the attention of my colleagues a painful reminder of WWII and the Nazi Holocaust in Europe. Several months ago, it came to light that the German Government was paying military pensions to former Nazi Waffen S.S. soldiers living in the United States and elsewhere, while scores of Jewish survivors in Eastern Europe and even some in the United States have never received any compensation for the horrors that they endured. I have spoken out on this subject numerous times, but I wanted to commend my colleagues to an ad placed by the American Jewish Committee in the New York Times on May 7, 1997, which clearly outlines this horrible and tragically ironic state of affairs.At the beginning of the ad, two pictures are displayed: One is of an elderly Jewish man who was a survivor of a Nazi ghetto in Eastern Europe, the other is of a man with arm raised in a Hitler salute, who was a soldier of the Waffen S.S. from Latvia. The headline asks: ``Guess Which One Receives a War Victims Pension from the German Government?''The text of the ad follows:If you guessed the survivor, you're wrong, sad to say. While Holocaust survivors in other parts of the world are eligible to receive German pensions, Holocaust survivors in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have never received a pension of any kind from Bonn. Inexplicably, the German government has simply drawn the line at providing such direct assistance to this group of survivors. Not so, however, for many of the survivors' former tormentors. Believe it or not, the German government provides generous monthly pensions to Nazi war veterans whose injuries or even mild, chronic ailments qualify them for ``war victims pensions.'' In the U.S. alone, there are 3,377 pensions sent each month to veterans of the armies of the Third Reich or their dependents! After the fall of communism, many Waffen S.S. veterans in the Baltic states and elsewhere in Eastern Europe discovered they, too, were eligible and are now receiving such pensions from Germany, while their victims are not. Today, an estimated 15,000-20,000 Jewish survivors of ghettos and concentration camps live in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. They are old, many are in poor health and financially destitute. Surely, they deserve some help and comfort in the last years of their lives. Join our call to the German government to correct this grievous wrong. Bring justice to the real victims of the Holocaust.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the many individuals who were noncombatants during the Holocaust of World War II, who risked their lives and those of their families to save countless people who faced death because of their religious beliefs. Two such people were Stacia Brazauskiene and Albinas Zilevicius. Both have been honored as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem Institute in Jerusalem and will be visiting with two of my constituents, Nathan and Sima Katz whose lives they saved during the war. They will be in New York City to join with the Katz family in celebrating the Bat Mitzvah of the Katz's granddaughter, Rebecca Levy.In 1941, Nathan Katz and his family were living in Shavel, Lithuania, when the Nazi forces evacuated all Jews into the Shavel Ghetto. With the help of a Lithuanian Gentile named Antonites, Nathan and Sima Katz escaped with eight other family members. After being forced to flee from several hiding places, they were taken to the farm of the Zilevicius family.Although Antonites has since disappeared into history, we know the heroic story of the Zileviciuses. With great care and much courage, the Zilevicius family built a hiding place behind a false wall in their barn for the Katzes, who remained on this farm protected by the Zilevicius until the end of the war. The Zilevicius family was constantly aware that they could be executed for their attempts at hiding the members of the Katz family. On several occasions, searches by the Nazis almost undid the heroic efforts of these protectors. Despite the horrendous atmosphere of terror in which both families lived, they survived.Most significant is the fact that the members of the Zilevicius family had no prior relationship with Nathan and Sima Katz nor any other member of the Katz family. In addition, the Zilevicius family received no remuneration from those families whose lives they were protecting.A war often produces great heroes who have distinguished themselves in military action. What is more compelling, however, is that ordinary citizens with no prior training risk their lives not for any national allegiance or desire for reward, but do so because it is the right and compassionate thing to do.Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join with me today in recognizing and honoring the remaining members of the Zilevicius family, Stacia Brazauskiene and Albinas Zilevicius, as they join with Nathan and Sima Katz whose lives that have both saved and enriched.",

In Taiwan, October 10 is known as National Day and is a day of celebration and remembrance. I think it is important that my colleagues and I take a moment to send our congratulations to the 21 million people on Taiwan for developing a strong participatory democracy.The ROC government began 11 years ago to take the final steps toward true political maturity. They broadened the scope of local and national elections, increased licensing of private TV and radio stations, and privatized government-owned monopolies. These reforms culminated with the popular, direct election of Lee Teng-hui as Taiwan's President.Mr. Speaker, the Republic of China's current representative to the United States, Dr. Jason C. Hu has been an integral part of the positive political developments of the past 11 years. In 1991, as a cabinet official under President Lee, Dr. Hu helped to open the political system to greater participation. As the President's spokesman during the last election, Dr. Hu helped to get out President Lee's message of political inclusion which helped garner Lee more than 54 percent of the vote in a four-way race. As representative to the United States, Dr. Hu has worked to strengthen ties between the United States and the ROC.Later this month, Dr. Hu will be returning to the ROC to become the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In this very senior position within the President's cabinet, Dr. Hu will build on the work he has begun here in the United States. I am sure he will help guide the ROC to even better relations with the United States. I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating the ROC on its National Day, and in wishing Dr. Hu well and thanking him for all his assistance.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today full of joy and fulfillment as my constituents and the other members of Temple Beth David of Commack, Suffolk County, prepare to join together to observe a most special Yom Kippur service.This Saturday, on Yom Kippur 5758, the most sacred of all days in the Jewish calendar, Rabbi Leonard Troupp of Temple Beth David and his congregants will reunite a sacred Holocaust Torah scroll from the town of Dobris, in what was then Czechoslovakia, with Petr Herrmann, a resident of that village prior to the Holocaust. Thus, the congregation will, in the words of Rabbi Troupp, ``witness the victory over evil and glimpse the possibility of God's promise for all mankind.''Mr. Herrmann's biography is one from which great novels can be written. It is full of adventure, good and evil and is filled with the indomitable human spirit to survive and maintain justice, love and freedom.The Herrmann family lived in Dobris from 1793 until the tragedy of the Holocaust. Uncles, cousins, friends, neighbors and even Mr. Herrmann's father, Alois, became B'nai Mitzvah as they stood before the Torah scroll that now has found a home at Temple Beth David. That Torah was a part of their lives that was viciously torn from them in 1939 as the Holocaust descended upon Europe. Mr. Herrmann, his parents, relatives and friends were taken from Dobris and sent to locations whose names evoke the most unbelievable horrors and cruelty that have yet been devised: Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, Birkenau. Sadly, many of the Dobris Jews perished at these death camps.On this Yom Kippur, 55 years since he and the Jewish community of Dobris were deported, Petr Herrmann will show that he has done more than just survive. He and his wife, Jarmilla, will stand once more before the Dobris Torah and recite the traditional Jewish blessing that gives thanks for having been able to observe and participate in this event. He will proudly recite the family names from Dobris--Arnstein, Bloch, Bohm, Fleischmann, Frankl, Gluck, Katz, Kosiner, Lederer, Lion, Oppenheimer, Pollack and Porges--families that were proud members of the Dobris Jewish community; families who are now but memories.Mr. Speaker, as we observe this solemn and moving occasion, it is fitting that we pay tribute to those self-effacing people who in the times of greatest adversity still reflect the compassion and courage of our society. I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me now in commending the efforts of Pamela Gershowitz, head of the Dobris Committee at Temple Beth David; Werner Reich, who led the search that brought Mr. Herrmann to Commack, Rabbi Leonard Troupp, and other members of the Temple Beth David congregation, in recognizing the heroic tale of Petr Herrmann, and in welcoming the Herrmann family back to the Dobris Torah in Commack.",

The school will be honored at a ceremony on November 6 with Education Secretary Richard Riley.The Thomas J. Lahey Elementary has taken many innovative steps to involve the entire community in improving the quality of education for its 962 students. Volunteers throughout the community assist in a variety of tasks from reading to children to providing computer instruction in the classroom. The school also works in conjunction with local businesses to further the growth of both the community and the students. For example, for National Book Week, a local supermarket donated more than 800 grocery bags which students used to create a drawing and write a summary of their favorite books. These bags were distributed throughout the town of Greenlawn. This unique partnership between school and community should serve as a model for other schools who are trying to do more for their students in a time of declining budgets. The partnership also reminds us all of the role we in the community need to play in bettering our Nation's schools.Much of the school's success can also be attributed to the work and dedication of its principal, Dr. Janet Perrin, who can often be found reading to children and participating in classroom instruction. Under her leadership, parents, students, and teachers have been challenged to give more of themselves to better both the school and the community.The school has taken important steps in increasing the children's access to the Internet and the World Wide Web. At the same time, the school is working with the community to teach students the importance of the arts in our society. The Thomas J. Lahey Elementary School truly embodies the ideals of creativity and innovation. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in honoring this truly dynamic institution.",

The school will be honored in a ceremony with Education Secretary, Richard Riley on November 6.Herricks Middle School strives to give every student the most well rounded education possible by fostering each child's cognitive, social, and physical development. Students are required to take a seventh grade guidance class, where they can initiate a positive relationship with a guidance counselor, early on in their academic careers. The school's academic teams, which consist of teachers, guidance counselors, administrators, and parents, focus upon each individual student, in order to provide critical support during difficult times. Herricks Middle School also has a diverse and innovative extracurricular program.The school has also placed an important focus upon computer literacy programs. The administration has recognized that a computer in a classroom may not necessarily foster a student's education unless a teacher is fully versed in the proper technology. Thus, a part time staff member has been hired to train teachers in computer technology and help them apply it in a classroom setting. Since this training program was implemented, computer use by teachers has tripled.The school's innovative curriculum also includes interdisciplinary units on the Holocaust and immigration. All of these factors have combined to create an extraordinary learning environment. The average daily attendance rate at Herricks Middle School exceeds an astounding 96 percent. The school's average standardized test scores in reading and math fall between the 82d and 92d percentiles nationwide. Much of this success can also be attributed to the leadership and commitment of the school's principal, Dr. Seth Weitzman.Herricks Middle School is working to build tomorrow's leaders through innovative academic and guidance programs, constant teacher training, and diversified extracurricular activities.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with my constituents and the friends and family of Jack B. Levy as they gather in Long Beach, New York to celebrate his 100th birthday. Jack is the quintessential example of the American success story and exudes those characteristics and traits that are part of the great American heritage. Born on February 25, 1898 in Levov, Russia as Yankel Levov, he immigrated to America at age 15. Passing through Ellis Island and by the whim of an immigrant inspector, he emerged into his new country as Jack B. Levy.Having been taken in by his aunt and uncle, Jack took advantage of the many opportunities being offered him and on his second day in America began his first job. Jack was not one to sit idly by and undertook a series of jobs that would include cab driver, train engineer and anything else at which he could earn a living working 12 hours a day seven days a week. With a voracious appetite for reading the daily papers, a habit which he still maintains, Jack quickly learned to read and write English. He soon became a citizen and established the practice of having voted in every local and national election.In 1924, he married Mollie Steinman and began a family that was to include his children, Lawrence, Aaron and Irene, eight grandchildren and twelve great-grandchildren. Much to the perseverance and dedication of their parents, the work ethic, the concept of community service and giving of one's self to help others became ingrained in their daily lives.Retirement has not changed Jack as is evidenced by the County of Nassau recognizing him for his outstanding work among senior citizens. Not only has he continued to be a source of joy and enlightenment to his entire family, he has also taken his many talents and effectively applied them to the members of the Senior Center of Long Beach, New York.Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to rise and join with me in honoring Mr. Jack B. Levy. At a time when we search for heroes and outstanding leaders to provide us with that leadership imbued with warmth, compassion and understanding, we are well-served by the extraordinary efforts of Jack Levy.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I have both procedural and substantive problems with this resolution.First, this resolution was circulated among committee members only last Wednesday evening. The International Relations Committee held a mark-up less than 24 hours later to consider the bill. The Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere never had a chance to consider the resolution.Second, committee rules require a week's notice before mark-up legislation. In this instance we got only a few hours notice. Only in unusual circumstances are such procedures allowable under the rules and then only after consultation with the ranking minority member. No such consultation took place.Mr. Speaker, I cannot understand why we must ram this resolution through the House. It's not as though the helicopters called for by the bill will get there any more quickly. They're not even built yet.With regard to the resolution itself, Members should be aware that, as the resolution implies, this is not about just 3 Blackhawks. This about many more. Three is nowhere near enough for the Colombian National Police to have an effective capability. In fact, to be effective, they need more like 12. The 3 Blackhawks in last year's foreign operations bill cost $36 million. That means that Congress will be on the hook for $144 million, not $36 million. And that's without even considering the outyear costs for additional training and maintenance.Mr. Speaker, the language in last year's foreign operations bill was not considered by the House or Senate before it emerged from conference and it has never been the subject of hearings. Never aired in subcommittee or full committee in either the House or the Senate. I submit that it has skewed the entire anti-narcotics budget for Latin America, causing cuts in funding for both Bolivia and Peru, countries which have been very successful in their anti-narcotics efforts. This congressionally driven mandate has never received any sort of formal assessment to determine whether it meets the most pressing counter-narcotics needs of the Colombian police. We have never asked ourselves whether the CNP has the pilots to fly these or whether they have the mechanics to maintain them. The answer to both is no. No pilots. No mechanics. No capability.In fact, both the Colombian Army and Air Force already have Blackhawks, already have the pilots, and already have the mechanics. Yet they seem unwilling to support the counter-narcotics mission of the CNP. As I understand it, the Blackhawks that were sold to Colombia previously were supposed to support that counter-narcotics mission. This lack of support indicates to me that the Colombian Defense Ministry does not believe that the counter-narcotics effort is a matter of national security. I believe it is perfectly reasonable for us to ask for--and get--cooperation between the Colombian military and the Mr. Speaker, just a month ago the GAO criticized the administration for not prioritizing the types of equipment that should be provided to Colombia. To my knowledge, no such assessment has been done with regard to Blackhawks. I think we should at least hold ourselves to the standard that we criticize the administration for not meeting.Let me say finally, that the Colombian National Police, led by General Serrano and the anti-narcotics unit led by Colonel Gallego, have a difficult and dangerous mission. Thousands of their men have given their lives in the fight against narcotics. I believe we should assist Colombia. The question is how best to do that. Last year's bill was not the way to do it and this resolution does not make the situation any better.I urge my colleagues to oppose the resolution. Thank you.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues to honor an extraordinary man, the President of India, Mr. K.R. Narayanan. Tonight he is receiving the Appeal of Conscience ``Statesman of the Year'' award, and it is hard to find someone who is more deserving of this honor.Mr. Speaker, President Narayanan has had a distinguished career in public service for almost half a century. He served with distinction in the Indian Foreign Service for over 30 years, eventually serving as India's Ambassador to the United States from 1980 to 1984. It was after his tenure in Washington that he then entered the realm of politics, and served as a Member of Parliament from the district in which he was born from 1985 to 1992, at which time he was elected to serve as India's Vice President. In July of 1997, Mr. Narayanan, I am proud to say, assumed the office of the President of India. He has also, over the course of his career, become an accomplished author of several books and articles on social, political and international theory.During his tenure, President Narayanan has shown a great respect for human rights in general, the rights of minorities in particular, and the rule of law. As the leader of the largest democracy in the world, he has done a remarkable job in continuing to move India in the direction of economic liberalization and ever greater political freedom. India's most recent parliamentary elections demonstrate the stability of this nation and the leadership that President Narayanan has provided in stewarding the country through a fairly tumultuous year in domestic politics.In international affairs, President Narayanan has shown an innate ability to get along with leaders of all stripes, and work for the common good, not merely for India's interests, as we continue to navigate through the uncertainties of the post-Cold War era. He is a diplomat, a public servant, an educator, and an author, but more importantly, he is a concerned human being and citizen of the world, who is dedicated to ensuring that those who can't care for themselves are cared for. Most of all he is unswerving in the notion that all people, no matter their origin, race or other distinction, deserve peace, happiness and security in life. On the occasion of the nations of India and Israel celebrating their 50th year in existence, I think it is important to point out that these were the basic principles upon which they were both founded, and the same ones which my good friend President Narayanan sincerely and honestly espouses.That is why the ``Appeal of Conscience'' Statesman of the Year award so befits President Narayanan.",

    "title": "CONGRATULATING THE PEOPLE OF THE COOPERATIVE REPUBLIC OF GUYANA FOR HOLDING MULTIPARTY ELECTIONS",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, House Concurrent Resolution 215 is a straightforward resolution which commends the people of Guyana for conducting what were, by all accounts, free and fair elections.An assessment of the voting by the International Foundation for Election Systems indicates that election day went very smoothly, that poll workers were professional, that relations between the poll workers and poll watchers from the major parties were cordial, and turnout was very high.The problems began after the polls closed when it became apparent that the poll workers were not as well trained in the mechanics of counting the votes as they were in actually administering the polls. In some instances, the elections commission had to reject incomplete tally sheets because they could not determine where the votes had been cast. In addition, the reporting of the returns took several days and caused public unease and suspicion which in turn led to unrest and violence.The resolution makes note of these issues; commends the Caribbean community for its offer to audit the results; and urges all parties to respect the outcome of the audit, and to work for peace and stability in Guyana by supporting the rule of law and respecting human rights.Mr. Speaker, I want to thank and commend our colleagues Congressmen Payne and Bishop, for introducing the resolution, and Chairman Gallegly for moving forward with the bill.I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 215, and join its sponsors in congratulating the people of Guyana for holding multiparty elections.Mr. Speaker, the people of the Caribbean have long led the way in Latin America in the practice of free and fair elections. Even before Jamaica and Trinidad gained their independence from Great Britain in the early 1960's, the islands, for the most part, generally were engaged in the practice of freely electing their local political leaders.In addition to Guyana, 1997 also saw free and fair elections in Jamaica and in St. Lucia. In my District, the U.S. Virgin Islands, we have been electing our Governors since 1970 and our local Legislative council since the early 1900's.While I support the resolution before us, I must caution that the process of the 1997 Guyana election is still ongoing.I commend the people of Guyana and the other Caribbean governments for their decision to let representatives of CARICOM conduct an audit of the 97 Guyana Presidential elections and I call on all concerned to await the outcome of the audit.Last Friday, my colleagues Donald Payne, the prime sponsor of this resolution, Representative Major Owens and our newest colleague, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, hosted a breakfast meeting with the Secretary General of CARICOM. It was a very informative meeting and I believe, will serve as the basis for a closer relationship between members of this body and CARICOM.Mr. Speaker I applaud efforts of the authors of this resolution and the people of Guyana in the struggle for greater democracy and urge my colleagues to vote yes on H. Con. Res. 215.",

    "title": "HONORING THE QUEENS BOROUGH PUBLIC LIBRARY",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to applaud the achievement of the Queens Borough Public Library which has grown to become by far and away the busiest library in the entire nation. The following article from the Washington Post describes how the library has continually sought input from a growing immigrant community. The Queens system checks out over 15.3 million books and materials a year, and spends more money per capita on books than any other major urban American library. The Queens Borough Public Library should serve as a model of how one institution can bring together people of various races and ethnicities for the good of an entire community.A Boroughful of Bookworms--Motivated Immigrants Make Queens Library New York, April 27--Pin-Pin Lin treks twice a week with her two sons and a big shopping bag to a crowded library in the borough of Queens. The Taiwanese immigrant herds her boys as they plunder books from library shelves and toss them in the bag. Sitting between her sons at a library table while they riffle through the books, she looks up words in an English- Cantonese dictionary and frets about any ``no-good'' English words they might read, speak or think. ``I no want to miss anything,'' explains Lin, who every Thursday morning, when her boys are in school, attends English language class at the Queens library. ``If I don't learn about American culture and speak English, I could lose them. If they think I not understand, they not do what I say.'' Book-obsessed, worrywart immigrants like Pin-Pin Lin are the driving reason why the Queens Public Library is far and away the busiest in the United States. Most library books in Queens do not go out of date. They wear out from overuse and fall to pieces. The library circulates the nation's highest number of books, tapes and videos--15.3 million a year. In the sprawling borough that lies across the East River from Manhattan, library card holders check out more books per capita than users of any big city library system in the country. The 1.95 million residents of Queens use the public library five times more frequently than residents of the District of Columbia, twice as often as residents of Prince George's County and a third more frequently than people in Montgomery County. The Los Angeles library serves about 1.4 million more people than the Queens library, but last year people in Queens checked out 4 million more books. ``We have complaints all the time from our older clientele, who want quiet and who want space. Well, our libraries aren't quiet and, for the most part, they aren't spacious,'' says Gary Strong, director of the Queens Public Library, one of three public library networks in the city. There is also a library system in Brooklyn and the New York Public Library serves Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island. ``The people who use our library are highly motivated,'' Strong adds. ``They want jobs. They want to learn how to live in America.'' Queens has the highest percentage of foreign-born residents of any borough in New York, a city that at the end of the 20th Century is sponging up one of the great waves of immigration in its history. Nearly half the residents of Queens speak a language other than English at home. More than a third were born in a foreign country. The extraordinary love affair between immigrants and libraries is a century-old story in New York, as it is in other American cities that have been immigrant gateways. The most crowded libraries in New York have always been in neighborhoods with the largest population of recent immigrants. That love affair continues at the end of the century, but with complications, especially in Queens. The book lovers who elbow each other for space in the library's 62 branches are more than ever before a mixed bunch--racially, linguistically and culturally. The busiest branch in the nation's busiest library system is in Flushing, which has been inundated in the past decade with Chinese, Korean, Indian, Russian, Colombian and Afghan immigrants. Until a handsome new library building opens this summer, the Flushing branch is crammed into a former furniture store. Inside, there are not nearly enough little chairs for all the little kids who wiggle and squeal and devour picture book after picture book. Stacks of blue plastic-coated foam pads are available so kids and parents can sit on the tile floor. Queues form behind computer terminals that allow immigrants to search home country periodicals using Chinese, Korean and Roman writing systems. ``Watch Your Belongings!'' signs are in English, Spanish and Chinese. There are no public bathrooms--space being too precious to waste on nonessentials. But there are librarians who speak Russian, Hindi, Chinese, Korean, Gujarati and Spanish. ``Have you ever wondered where the new South Asian materials are?'' asks a sign taped to a pillar in the Flushing branch library. ``Well, wonder no more. They're here! You can find materials in: Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Malayalam and Urdu.'' ``We have gone from a dozen countries to a hundred countries,'' says Strong. ``We are not just waiting for them to come to us after they have solved all their problems, after they have a job and after they have the kids in school. We go after them. We advertise. We do not check their immigration status.'' Immigration had already transformed Flushing from a staid middle-class Italian and Jewish community into a polyglot boom town when Ruth Herzburg took over eight years ago as library branch manager. Herzburg quickly discovered that the branch was falling behind the newcomer mix. Herzburg tentatively put a small collection of Korean- language books out on a shelf five years ago. ``Those books walked off the shelves. Before that, we didn't really know the Koreans were here,'' she said. As immigrants make the transition from their native language to English, Herzburg says they hunger for basically the same kinds of books--translations of potboiler American fiction like Danielle Steel, self-help books and computer books. Many immigrants to Queens have technical skills, she says, and they demand science, technology and business books. By spending more money per capital on books and other materials than any other major urban American library system, the Queens Public Library has marshaled its resources to seduce each new group of immigrants and lure them into the branches. The seduction starts by sending library emissaries to immigrant associations that work with recent arrivals. In the languages of the immigrants, they explain how the library can show them how to get a driver's license, navigate the Internet and learn English. The library runs the largest English-as-a-second-language program in the country and says it could double its enrollment if it had more space and money. ``Starting with survival skills, they get introduced to the library and it is often the beginning of a lifelong habit,'' said Adriana Acaucan Tandler, head of the library's New Americans program and herself an immigrant from Brazil. Using census data and a demographer and by commissioning polls among Queens residents, the library has been able to spot holes in library usage. The biggest hole in the late 1980s was among Spanish speakers. The library went after them with an aggressive public relations campaign. It translated applications for library cards into Spanish, purchased spots on Spanish radio and pulled together a Spanish collection of 100,000 items in 10 branches. ``In just three years, we found that Spanish speakers were using the library as much as anybody in the borough. They read everything from Cervantes to `Superman.' The secret of our success is that we give people what they want, instead of what we think they should have,'' Acauan Tandler said. What adults want, above all else, is translations of American bestsellers in their own language. The library tries to buy them quickly and in quantity. At the Flushing branch, the head librarian has about $125,000 a year to spend as she wishes on ``hot'' books. ``We don't wait for the central office to send out popular books. We like to go around to all the local bookstores and buy popular books off the shelves. All the books are in foreign languages. We don't even have an English-language bookstore in Flushing,'' said Herzburg. Pin-Pin Lin tries to steer her boys, ages 10 and 13, away from Chinese-language books. She prefers they read only in English. To that end, she makes sure they leave the library after each visit with 20 or so English books in the shopping bag. ``I don't care if they read all. Kid is kid. If they don't like books. I bring them back and get more,'' said Lin.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with my constituents and the students, parents, teachers and administrators in honoring Dr. Michael B. Walsh upon his retirement as superintendent of the Smithtown Central School District. Dr. Walsh personifies that most effective educator who is not only recognized as a scholar in his field of specialization, but also is able to educate others through the effective example he creates in his own behavior.His educational endeavors typify the true American success story. Beginning as a teacher of mathematics in the Levittown School District, Dr. Walsh quickly advanced through a series of leadership positions. As Chairman of the Mathematics Department of Smithtown Central High School, he introduced and supported several experimental programs that successfully enhanced the school's curriculum and resulted in increased student achievement. It soon became apparent to the leaders of the Smithtown Central School District that Michael Walsh possessed valuable and effective administrative and instructional talents that extended far beyond the area of mathematics and would serve to enhance the comprehensive program that was being offered by the district. Dr. Walsh became a Central Office Administrative Intern and went on to assume the positions of Assistant to the Superintendent for Central Administration and Administrator for Operations. In 1982, he joined the Amityville School District and, during a ten year tenure, served as the district's Assistant Superintendent and Superintendent. In 1992, he returned to Smithtown to assume the district's superintendency. Realizing the impact rapidly changing technology would have on our students' lives, he was most instrumental in developing a partnership with Symbol Technology in creating a wireless transmission component that would link the schools in a classroom setting.Dr. Walsh's talents have been recognized outside the Smithtown District. He serves as an Adjunct Instructor of Educational Administration at the School of Professional Development at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. He is secretary of the Suffolk County School Superintendent's Association and is a member of the House of Delegates of the New York State Committee of School Superintendents.Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in recognizing these honors Dr. Walsh so richly deserves. It is a most effective teacher who can create positive change in a classroom. Dr. Michael B. Walsh has had an impact far beyond the classroom and his great talents have enhanced and fulfilled our community.",

Through the insight of such dedicated and talented community members as Joe Goldstein, Eric Gerstel and Sydney Abrahams, the synagogue's first president, the Israel Center of Hillcrest Manor came into being in 1948, the same year the State of Israel was created. Through unique determination and a indefatigable spirit, these men went from door to door throughout the Flushing, Queens neighborhood building up both spiritual and financial support to establish this synagogue.Since its inception, the Israel Center of Hillcrest Manor has brought to the community a sense of dedicated service and a foundation of stability that has allowed its membership to raise their families and incorporate all age groups into an environment sensitive to their needs.The Israel Center of Hillcrest Manor, under the leadership of Rabbi Michael Strasberg, its spiritual leader for more than two decades, and its current president, Leo Lederer, has continued the record of service and caring that is the hallmark of this great house of worship. Having provided the Flushing community for half a century with a vibrant Hebrew School, youth program and a highly effective Men's Club and Sisterhood, the Israel Center of Hillcrest Manor is now prepared to lead its members into the second half century of fulfillment.There are few organizations that have emerged with a continuous record of compassionate achievement as has the Israel Center of Hillcrest Manor. I ask all my colleagues to rise with me in congratulating the synagogue, its members and officers on this wonderful achievement and extending our warmest support for another fifty years of service.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with my constituents and members of the Hollis Hills Jewish Center as they celebrate the 50th anniversary of this great house of worship, and honor their most distinguished and world-renowned Cantor, Sol Zim and his wife June, for 35 years of distinguished service to the synagogue.In 1964, Sol and June Zim began a relationship with the Hollis Hills Jewish Center that would not only enhance the spiritual and secular lives of the synagogue's members, but would allow Cantor Zim to perform around the world to share the joy and fulfillment that epitomize his music. As the sixth generation of a family of exceptionally talented cantors, Sol Zim has studied with such outstanding cantorial instructors as Joshua Weisser, Moshe Koussevitzky, Sholom Secunda and Oscar Julius. He has received degrees from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. Brooklyn College and New York University. His extraordinary voice brought him offers for positions in such distinguished opera companies as the Vienna State Opera Theater and the Israeli National Opera. Yet it was to our great benefit that Sol Zim chose to pursue his musical career as a cantor.Mr. Speaker, in addition to his unforgettable voice, Sol Zim is a most prolific writer of Jewish popular songs and prayer melodies that are sung in congregations throughout the world. He has composed more than 20 cassettes and tapes of music dedicated to Yiddish, Hebrew, Chassidic and Cantorial themes. A hallmark of his desire for all people to love music is the creation of a children's choir in those cities in which he has appeared. In the 1970's and 80's, he founded ``The Brothers Zim'' which quickly became America's foremost Jewish singing group.Both he and his wife June take their role as community leaders most seriously. Through their efforts, they have brought direction and compassion to many viable undertakings. June has served as the synagogues' Vice-President of Sisterhood, Vice-President of Jewish Family Living for the Queens Region of National Women's League, and Co-Chair of many of the Hollis Hills Jewish Center's annual conferences.Sol serves the National Chairman of the Jewish War Heroes Fund, and has been honored as Man of the Year and received humanitarian awards by such diverse organizations as the United Jewish Appeal, Israel Bonds, Hadassahm Bnai Brith, Amit Women and Shaare Zedek Hospital.Mr. Speaker, in honor of all their great achievements, I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join with me and rise to express their appreciation for the Zims.",

The amendment that I offered gives us the opportunity to fulfill our additional responsibility to strengthening protections for other vulnerable populations; notably, the elderly and the disabled. They, too, are especially vulnerable to being victimized by violent criminals. They, too, are often preyed upon by sick, despicable individuals who rob them of their innocence and their security.Those criminals who rape, rob, or assault the elderly and the mentally or physically disabled should be appropriately punished as well. My amendment makes a strong statement. It speaks loud and clear to seniors and the disabled: We will severely punish criminals who seek you out because of your vulnerability.Mr. Chairman, my amendment does not require mandatory sentences, nor does it remove the court's discretion, but it makes these crimes crimes of a higher magnitude.Crime is a concern to all of us. Violent crime such as rape, robbery, and assault, is of grave concern, and violent crime against the elderly and the disabled adds to our outrage. We are outraged because vulnerable victims, whether they be children, the elderly, or the disabled, cannot defend themselves from violent acts.When criminals inflict physical injuries on the vulnerable, the wounds take longer to heal, the bones take longer to mend, and the scars are permanent. It is more difficult for them to reintegrate into society once more. I urge all of our colleagues to stand up for the most vulnerable among us, the children, as well as our seniors and disabled, and to support this amendment.The CHAIRMAN pro tempore.

These dedicated individuals have committed themselves to enhancing the lives of other children in need of strong emotional, physical and financial support. With the great preponderance of news reports relating to violence that is devastating the youth of our country, it is most reassuring that certain individuals and organizations have dedicated themselves to directing and educating our youth in positive and productive areas. This particular young, dynamic organization, inspired and directed by Robert F. Eslick, has striven mightily in advancing their charitable and educational goals that actively seeks to sensitize children to identify those youngsters in need of assistance and work with them to successfully challenge their handicaps. In addition, this most-dedicated group has also been successful in providing financial support to families facing extra-ordinary health needs.Embodying the spirit of Kids Helping Kids, Robert A.J. Eslick, nine years of age, has established a record of activism and compassion that readily serves as an example for adults and children involved in philanthropic affairs. At age two in 1990, he entered his first race, a 1.4 miler. By dint of personality and supreme self-involvement, Robert was ranked eighth in the country by USA Track &amp; Field for 5K races. He has continued to participate as a runner while dedicating his efforts to the multi-faceted program of Kids Helping Kids.As we become dispirited by events that tend to show our youth adrift without a compass, it is invigorating and greatly appreciated that Kids Helping Kids continues to grow and embody the great traditions of caring and compassion that are the foundations of our country.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a very special and unique relationship between the well-known Japanese company, Toshiba, and a great American company based on Long Island, Audiovox Corporation. For the last 14 years they have shared an incredible partnership in cellular phone manufacturing and distribution, which has led to this day, during which we are marking the 7 millionth cellular phone that has derived from this very special relationship. In fact, I have taken the liberty of proclaiming this day, ``Audiovox-Toshiba Day'' in the 5th District of New York.At a ceremony today at Audiovox's headquarters in the town of Happauge in Suffolk County on Long Island, Toshiba will be presenting a gold phone to mark this remarkable milestone. Mr. Takao Kishida, General Manager of the Mobile Communications Division of Toshiba and Mr. Kunio Horiouchi, Department Manager of the division, will be presenting the phone on behalf of Pizo Nishimuro, President of Toshiba. Accepting this unique award on behalf of Audiovox will be two very good close friends of mine, Phillip Christopher, President and CEO of Audiovox Communications Corporation (ACC), and John J. Shalam, Chairman of Audiovox.Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before, the nature of the relationship has been Toshiba manufacturing the phones and Audiovox marketing them in North America. I'm sure my colleagues realize that there are countless numbers of companies in the world who manufacture cellular phones. However, over half of the phones that Audiovox has sold over the course of almost 15 years have come from Toshiba's production line, and, Audiovox officials do not hesitate for one minute to say that Toshiba is the best--based on their quality, their integrity and character, and their loyalty to this special relationship. That's why I think it's so important to highlight this special relationship as an example of what can come of the very special bond that has existed over the past 50 years between the United States and Japan. Regardless of the differences we may encounter in our general trade relationship, I wanted to take a moment to recognize the unique partnership between Toshiba and Audiovox, and the remarkable achievements that they have reached together. This is an exemplary union that should be held up to the highest regard, to demonstrate to others the opportunities that exist between our countries and to encourage other companies to engage in similar ventures.Trade is so very much a critical component of U.S. policy, particularly in this day and age as we become more of a global village. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, please join with me today as we honor two truly energetic and viable companies who have chosen to engage in a partnership that has only served to complement each companies' strengths as well as continuing to highlight the special bond between the U.S. and Japan.",

    "title": "DISAPPROVAL OF MOST-FAVORED-NATION TREATMENT FOR CHINA",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to House Joint Resolution 121 and in support of normal trade relations with China.Every year we debate the extension of NTR to China, but the debate is not really about trade, it's about how we relate to China. There are many reasons for members to object to aspects of the U.S.-PRC relationship. There are issues involving missile proliferation, nuclear technology transfers, religious freedom, human rights, and Taiwan. Opponents of NTR will claim any or all of these issues as justification for discontinuing normal trade relations.For me, the issue has always been how best to convey our concerns to China and how to persuade them to be constructive actors on the international stage. The best way is through engagement because if we don't deal with China, none of the issues that we believe are important will be addressed.This is equally true where we share a common agenda with China. For example, it is in both our interests that North Korea not develop nuclear weapons. Likewise, it is in both our interests that China not devalue the yuan. Such a step could worsen the already severe economic crisis in Asia and undermine American interests there. Would China be more willing to be constructive on these issues if we cut off normal trade relations? I doubt it.This is not a call for business as usual or an indication that we should abandon our security, proliferation or human rights concerns. On the contrary, we must forcefully articulate our views to China where we disagree. The President did just that when he was in China a few weeks ago. He had the unprecedented opportunity to speak directly to the Chinese people about American concerns and American values. This opportunity would not have occurred had we cut off NTR last year and I believe U.S. interests would be seriously damaged if we approve this resolution today.Mr. Speaker, when the United States Government deals directly with China, when U.S. companies do business in China, and when U.S. citizens travel to China, China is exposed to American values. That's the best way for us to engage China.I urge my colleagues to oppose the resolution and support normal trade relations with China.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. This act, an unprovoked use of force and flagrant violation of international law, divided the island and created a tense and dangerous situation. Sadly, almost a quarter of a century after this tragedy, the threat of renewed violence seems greater than ever. We must work together to ensure a peaceful and fair settlement to one of the world's most bitter conflicts.I call on the leaders of Turkish-occupied Cyprus to recognize the will of the international community and make positive steps towards ending the stand-off which has plagued the once-peaceful nation of Cyprus for twenty-four years. Mr. Denktash must end his demand that the illegitimate Turkish Cypriot Republic be recognized before he agrees to negotiations with Mr. Clerides. And Turkey must not aggravate tensions in the region by threatening the use of force against the nation of Cyprus.However, I am encouraged by the work of United Nations envoy Diego Cordovez as well as special U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, and I believe that a peaceful path towards reunification can be found with the cooperation of all parties. As we near the 21st century, we move towards an era of unlimited potential. The days of invasion, intimidation, and forceful coercion can no longer be tolerated and must be replaced by a system of mutual cooperation and the peaceful arbitration of disputes. In the next millennium, there will be no place for armies of occupation.I am proud to reaffirm the close friendship between the United States and Cyprus, particularly highlighted by our commitment to ending the division of Cyprus once and for all. However, on this day we should also remember the victims of violence during and after the 1974 invasion, many of whom are still missing. The suffering experienced by them and their families, and the continuing plight of enclaved Greek Cypriots in the Turkish-occupied territory, compel us to seek a quick and peaceful solution to the Cyprus problem.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3167, a bill to designate the United States Post Office located in East Northport, New York, as the ``Jerome Anthony Ambro, Jr. Post Office Building.'' This legislation is a fitting tribute to a great man and selfless public servant.I am proud to be the sponsor of this legislation. The fact that all 31 members of the New York Delegation cosponsored the bill demonstrates the respect we all have for Jerome Anthony Ambro, Jr. In addition, both Senators from New York have sponsored similar legislation in the other body. It doesn't stop there. The Huntington Town Board--the local government representing the community where the post office is located--unanimously approved a resolution urging Congress to pass this legislation.The reason this bill has such widespread support, from the grassroots to the Capitol, is that Jerry, as his friends called him, served his constituents, colleagues and country well. Unfortunately, our nation sustained a major loss when Jerry passed away in 1993 from diabetes complications.Jerry was a lifelong New Yorker, and he never forgot his roots. Following his service in the United States Army, Jerry served his constituents admirably for four terms as the Huntington Town Supervisor. In that role, he worked diligently to improve environmental protection and senior citizen services on Long Island.Following his local success, Jerry was elected to three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives where he served as Chairman of the Science Subcommittee on Natural Resources and the Environment. He played a leading role in passing clean air and clean water legislation that improved our country's quality of life. Jerry also was a tireless advocate for senior citizens, fighting for the strengthening of Social Security.Jerry Ambro's distinguished public service in local government and the House of Representatives deserves to be honored. The East Northport Post Office will be a legacy to Jerry's tireless efforts to improve the lives of New Yorkers.I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Postal Service Subcommittee for their cooperation in moving this legislation, and I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support this important bill.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and congratulate Rachel Friedstein, Jessica Berenblum, Lauren Schulz, and Raina Tripp who placed second in their quest for the Bayer/National Science Foundation (NSF) Award for Community Innovation. Each of these students has received a $3,000 savings bond and will be honored at a Capitol Hill Ceremony. We should also recognize the outstanding work of their coach, Mr. Jim Frank, whose leadership and guidance was instrumental to the students' success.These Cold Spring Harbor Junior High School students conducted a comprehensive study of the long term damage caused by wearing backpacks that were excessively heavy. They concluded that 25-33 percent of adolescents already experience lower back pain and that overweight backpacks can exacerbate these problems leading to even more serious back conditions later in life. The students worked with physicians and chiropractors to identify risk factors and prevention methods.In the fall, these four students began a program entitled ``Light is Right'' which seeks to inform their peers about the dangers associated with backpack misuse and strategies to avoid this problem. They will hold an assembly for new junior high school students and distribute brochures and stickers describing the problem. Moreover, they will work to create an Internet survey to conduct further research.The creativity and ingenuity of these students should serve as a model to all of our schools and communities. It also shows that students can really make a difference in the lives of their peers by working with their school and the private sector. The award program, which is jointly run by the National Science Foundation and the Bayer Corporation, has adhered to this model of public-private interdependence. It is my hope that other schools throughout the New York area will look to this example and create similar programs. Most importantly, their work will enable other teenagers to lead healthier lives.Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues join me in rising to honor these extraordinary students and their coach.",

McConnell upon his retirement as the bank's president and CEO.Mr. McConnell's background is both diverse and effective. Prior to his election as president of the Flushing Savings Bank he held prominent management positions with AMBAC Industries of Garden City, New York and the EDO Corporation of College Point. He joined the Flushing Savings Bank in 1974 as Vice-president and Treasurer. Realizing his keen sense of leadership and a most effective approach to getting things done, the bank appointed him president in 1981, appointed him to its board of directors in 1983 and elected him Chief Executive Officer in 1990.Mr. McConnell's multiple leadership talents reach far beyond the Flushing Savings Bank. He has served on the Board of Directors of the Community Bankers Association of New York State from 1987 to 1997 and served as the Association's Chairman from 1990-1991. He was highly instrumental in negotiations which led to the successful merger of the Savings Bank Association of New York State with the New York League of Savings Institutions, thereby creating the Community Bankers Association.Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join with me and rise in honor of James F. McConnell, who has imparted a sense of professionalism, leadership and community responsibility. His record is one of dynamism and productivity which readily emerges as a yardstick by which all such future efforts are measured.",

In doing so, I am being asked to fill a pair of big shoes by succeeding the Caucus's founder and first Co-Chairman, Frank Pallone.Mr. Speaker, the Caucus on India and Indian Americans was founded more than five years ago by Frank. His district has a large and vibrant Indian American community, and Frank decided their voice needed to be heard in the Congress. What began as a handful of Members five years ago has been transformed into a thriving Caucus of more than one hundred Members, making the Caucus one of the largest ethnic Caucuses in the Congress.Mr. Speaker, much of this success and growth is a tribute to Frank Pallone's leadership and energy. During his term as Co-Chairman, he has worked tirelessly in the House to improve relations between India, the world's largest democracy, and the United States, the world's oldest democracy. The Caucus has been a forum for important discussions between the Caucus Members and senior politicians, diplomats and industrialists from India. Outside Washington, Frank also has been very active, traveling to cities around the United States where he has met with hundreds of Indian American community leaders.Mr. Speaker, as the Caucus of India and Indian Americans enters its sixth year, I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Frank on a job well done. I am certain the other Members of the Caucus agree with me that we are looking forward to his continued strong participation as a senior Member of the Caucus and to his strong support of the interests of the Indian American Community.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.Mr. Chairman, I stand here today, not as a Democrat, and I hope that my colleagues do not stand there as Republicans, and I would ask all of our colleagues, indeed, to question why do we stand here. What is this all about? What are our values? Where do we fit in this world?We think sometimes about heroes. Indeed, what are heroes? A hero is usually an ordinary person who steps out of the crowd, having no gain for himself, and tries to stop a maddened mob from destroying somebody else's life and interjects himself into the fray. These are some of the values that we try to impart to our children. We should not mind only our own business, we should be trying to help other people.I have heard the question asked over and over again by so many colleagues on both sides of the aisle, what is in the U.S. interest? What are we as a country? I think there is probably not a person in this body who would dispute the fact that they would like to see the U.S. recorded in permanent history as a Nation that is both mighty and just. What is the purpose of our might if we do not use it for good? Is justice not just a state of mind unless we use it for the greater good?I have been, most of my life, a passivist, opposed to so many of the things that so many of my friends have supported. This is a time for peace. This is a time to use our might and our strength and the unique position that the United States of America is in today for good, for something decent, to help save the lives of people in a place so far away, where human beings have been destroyed, where ethnic cleansing has taken place, where genocide has existed. Is that not in the American interest?Mr. Chairman, I come from a very small people, a people who, in our lifetime, were almost totally annihilated by forces of evil. So much of the world turned its back. Oh, they had excuses. We did not know. We did not see. We did not believe. No one told us.We have been disabused of those excuses, Mr. Chairman, today, because we know what is going on and what has gone on and what will go on unless the forces of justice and reason somehow intervene.It was not until the world intervened and democratic countries stepped up to the plate that the people that I come from were liberated, snatched from the jaws of death in concentration camps.So many of the countries, including the United States, for whom all of us are so grateful, stepped up to the plate because it was in America's national interest, and to do the right thing.So many of us and so many others took an oath when that happened, Mr. Chairman, that said, never again, never again were we going to allow something like this to happen. We swore this to ourselves, and we swore this to our God. Others swore along with us.What does that mean? Did we mean this only for ourselves? Did we mean that we would step up to the plate only if we were going to be wiped out? I do not think so, Mr. Chairman.The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Ackerman) has expired.(By unanimous consent, Mr. Ackerman was allowed to proceed for 2 additional minutes.)",

This great day in Greek history commemorates the successful struggle of the Greek people for national sovereignty. It is no secret that the United States and Greece have shared a close relationship since Greece's independence. In fact, Greece is one of the very few countries in the world that has stood alongside the United States during every major conflict of this last century.The United States shares many common threads with Greece, including a commitment to democracy, peace, and respect for human rights. I think it's safe to say that the Founding Fathers of Greece and the United States would be proud of the tremendous achievements of both nations as well as their closeness. The strong bond that is shared by these two countries is now approaching its third century, and as we rapidly approach the twenty-first century, I think its imperative that we recognize countries such as Greece that are eager to move into the next millennium hand-in-hand with the United States.Greek-Americans all around the country are celebrating this great day for their homeland. Parades, dances, songs and feasts will be occurring all over this country in celebration of Greek independence. The celebrations both here and in Greece will no doubt demonstrate the fortitude of its people. Throughout the past 200 years there have been repeated challenges to the independence of Greece, yet its people have stridently fought to maintain both their democracy and independence--and the United States and its people have been proud to stand by her and provide strength, assistance and friendship to overcome those struggles.I am pleased to have this opportunity to once again celebrate Greek culture and toast the Greek people. It is an honor to rise and commemorate the 178th Greek Independence Day. On this day we celebrate more than just Greece's independence, we celebrate Greece as a country and as a friend.",

    "title": "HONORING EMMA JANE BLOOMFIELD",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and congratulate Emma Jane Bloomfield, who recently won an award from the Concord Rotary Club for her paper on Mongolian Culture. This paper was brought to my attention by her proud grandmother, Blanche Bloomfield, who resides in my district in Kings Point, NY. This essay contest demonstrates how our communities can work with our schools to further the educational goals of all of our nation's children. I hope all of my colleagues will have an opportunity to review this insightful and cogent essay and I would once again like to congratulate Emma on her outstanding work.Under the control of Genghis Khan, the Mongolian people once had a forceful army, exploding with wrath and rage. However, the mounting tension between other countries and the Mongolians, caused by so many battles, resulted in the shattering of the Mongol empire. Since the 1300s, they have struggled to rebuild their society. Now that the strength and anger have faded from their community, many Mongols today believe in a strong emphasis on politeness and hospitality. Mongols live on the seeping grasslands of Asia and they use their environment to satisfy many needs. In the rural areas of Mongolia, many men are herdsmen who supervise the wild horses and yaks that roam the Mongols' homeland. The history of the Mongolian people has influenced their present culture, and their beliefs, styles of life, and natural environment are still contributing to the formation of their society and identities. Mongolian history is traced back to the days of power when Genghis Khan ruled the Mongol empire. Genghis Khan was a wild horseman and a strong warrior who inspired the bravery of his people. He had great accuracy and distance when shooting a bow and arrow, and he had a keen mind that conjured up strategies he used to win battles. Khan was widely known for ruthlessly attacking towns and cities for the rewards of victory. Genghis Khan conquered more territory than anyone in Mongolian history, and he imposed his reputation on the world. Despite the cruelty that Khan showed toward other countries, the Mongols praised him and viewed him as the founder of their nation, creator of their people. The Mongols called Genghis Khan the ``Supreme Ruler Over the Ocean'' and ``Emperor of Emperors.'' A large portion of Khan's success was due to his solid armies, both his soldiers and his horsemen. Genghis Khan's armies were vast, and he grouped his men into units of tens, hundreds, thousands, and ten-thousands, so they could move in to battle quickly. Khan's powerful armies were often forced to over 225 miles of land within a day. Most of the warriors were horsemen, and they each owned three to twenty horses, which they alternated daily to give each horse sufficient time to rest. Weapons carried by the warriors were strong bows, lances, and swords. The soldiers wore heavy leather called lamellar to shield them from the fierce swipe of a sword. Many of Genghis Khan's words provoked a feeling of force and fury. ``The greatest pleasure is to vanquish your enemies and chase them before you rob them of their wealth and see those dear to them baked in tears, to ride their horses,'' he once said. Khan was fueled by experiences of the many bloody battles that his armies fought. Genghis Khan relished seeing those inferior to him suffer, and he fought only to claim power and to satisfy his dreams. Khan's dream was to establish a network of riders, used as a spy system, all over Asia. His armies did succeed in taking over parts of China, Middle Asia, and Europe. Khan's empire stretched from Europe to Russia in the north, and from Vietnam to Iraq in the south. With their equipment, strength, and intelligence, the Mongol Umpire led by Genghis Khan seemed immortal. Unfortunately for Mongolian society, the red heat of their empire soon faded to a cowering pink. Because they fought so many battles, the rivalries and conflicts between Mongolia and other countries brought misfortune and an unexpected end to the Mongol Empire. At that time, Russia and China began to expand and they claimed most power that the Mongols had once held. The collapse of the Mongol empire in 1505 scarred its people and society. The power supplied by Genghis Khan was humiliated, and the next centuries were filled with tragedy and struggle. While the Mongols tried to rebuild their economy, Russia and China prevailed over them and took parts of Mongolia under their control. In 1990, the break-up of the Soviet Union provided a blessing to the Mongols, and it offered freedom to some. However, problems still remain in Mongolia. To survive, the people have been forced to roam the grasslands, hunting with bow and arrow, taming horses, and raising livestock. The Mongols' strength has only re- emerged through their formation of a government while they have squirmed out of the reach of Russian and Chinese power. Having rebuilt their society, natural and spiritual things now claim a higher rank among the Mongols. Mongolians believe that heaven, a home to the gods, holds an abundance of power. The Mongols honor heaven and all of nature under it. In fact, earlier Mongol tribes blessed and proclaimed their leaders as the ``sons of heaven.'' In their households, Mongols have always strongly emphasize politeness and hospitality. In pre-modern times the Mongols' homes were spread out all over the Mongols' land. This caused many people to travel from camp to camp, who would need a home for one night. Mongols provided shelter for visitors who later would face a hike across the windswept grasslands. With the arrival of a guest at a Mongolian's home, the host would traditionally offer a hospitality bowl, which would hold chunks of pungent cheeses, sugar cubes, candies, and bordzig pastries deep fried in yak and mutton fats. Using the hospitality bowl was the style in which the Mongols welcomed their guests. Mongolians believed in treating visitors as old and beloved friends, and in turn, the guest of a household would offer kind words to the hosts, and would express respect and gratitude by accepting foods at the table with customary gestures. The traditional religion observed by the people of Mongolia is Tibetan Buddhism. Pedestals, in a Mongol's home, hold statues of Buddha, a symbol that is prominent in Tibetan Buddhism. After freedom of religion was introduced to Mongolia in 1990, Buddhism became the most commonly practiced religion. The government of Mongolia offered money to support the restoration of a sacred Buddhist Monastery. Religion holds importance to the Mongols, yet it only occupies one level of Mongolian life. In the rural areas of Mongolia, the people's lives revolve around hunting or herding livestock. The semi-wild horses who graze in the mountains that enclose the grasslands, are for riding and training purposes. A Mongolian horse herdsman typically makes decisions as to where to let the horses graze, and when to move them to the next camps. Herders of any animal must eventually sell or butcher the livestock. Herdsmen efficiently use parts of the animals for fuel, warmth, and shelter. The job of a herdsman may also be to breed rarer animals, and sell them. Traditionally, hunting occupies a large portion of Mongolian life. Many Mongol hunters use ancient archery techniques to hunt birds. Keen dogs and cheetahs are also used to track down a hunter's game. Occasionally, in earlier times, large-scale hunts would be organized where beaters would drive entire herds of antelope into the lurking hunters' bows. Falcons, too, were used to lead large game to the hunters. In the rural places of Mongolia, the rural life of a Mongol is chiefly filled by the needs of the flocks of sheep, goats, herds of horses, cattle, or camels. Springtime is the season in which herdsmen have the most commitments to the livestock. The births of animals occupy great spans of time, and often an entire family comes to the fields and helps the herder with a difficult birth. Herdsmen scurry around tending to the needs of animals, trying to establish a health start to the herding season. Summertime is less busy, for herds of animals resort to pasture land and the livestock doesn't demand assistance from herdsmen. Yet in the summertime there is still some work to attend to: sheep are shorn for their dense wool and camels and goats are combed for their velvety under-wool. The autumn winds dry the moisture from the grasslands, and as winter approaches groups of herdsmen collect their livestock. The animals are confined to graze in small pens and barns, and hay becomes their main diet. In late autumn equipment and tools are replaced or mended for the new births of livestock in the springtime. Mongolian winters come to the land quickly and last for a long amount of time. Temperatures stay low for weeks, which make each day harder for Mongols to endure. Herdsmen stay loyal to the penned animals and help them through the months of winter, so the cycle can repeat. On the grasslands outside of Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia, the Mongols live in tent-like gers (see appendix D). These homes have rounded walls that slope upward to form a point at the top. These traditional homes provide the Mongolian people with warmth and protect them from blizzards that may storm the grasslands. Gers are covered with felt, usually made by women. The process of felt-making typically takes two weeks for enough cloth to cover an entire ger. Because many Mongols are followers of animal herds, the ger satisfies the needs of their culture, for the ger is easy to dismantle and is designed to be transported from place to place. A ger is most commonly moved by a team of camels or oxen, the strongest animals that can support a heavy weight. The placement of a ger has been influenced by Mongols' traditions. Throughout Mongolian history, the door of the ger has always faced southeast. Mongols believe that because winds gust from the southeast and the sacred sun rises in the east, gers that face in this direction are blessed. The most common animal to be seen roaming the land of Mongolia is the yak. Mongols use the abundance of these animals to benefit their culture by herding them and using the animals as a source of trade. The Mongolian people also dine on meat from yaks and use their fat to fuel stoves. The Mongolian government trades yaks to other countries for oil, manufactured goods, and machinery, which are all conveniences that Mongols cannot process themselves. The Mongols' land is a tangle of many different environments. A portion of Mongolia includes a vast mountain range locking in bleak and rocky grasslands. The most prominent mountain range is the Altai. This cluster of mountains holds the only glaciers in Mongolia, which makes for a nipping, frigid climate. The Mongolian grasslands also border the Gobi Desert, where the climate is arid and hot. Mongol culture, therefore, has adapted to living among extreme temperatures, but it revolves mostly around the more temperate grasslands. The Mongols have proven, in the survival of their culture, that to this day they still have the spark and the strength that the great Genghis Khan possessed.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, we all have been told in so many words that bankruptcies are on the rise, and indeed they are, and that because of that everybody suffers because of increased interest rates and other charges. And we are also told, and rightfully so, that consumers need to take personal responsibility for their obligations. That is true, as well.As we address bankruptcy reform today, we have a unique opportunity to at least modestly combat part of this rising trend in bankruptcies, and one of the best ways that we can begin to tackle that is to have more information for consumers so that they are better informed and can make smarter decisions about their credit needs.How do we do this? First, with better and clearer disclosure rules for solicitations and credit applications. Every one of my colleagues here are familiar were the deluge of solicitations that we get in the mail almost on a daily basis advertising a particularly low introductory rate, and the rate is on the envelope and it does not tell us how long that rate is for and the consumer cannot make an objective kind of a decision; and then he borrows at a rate that he thinks he is going to have for a longer period of time and that ends and the interest rates goes up and he is paying more than he did under a previous credit card that he might have had that he switched over from.This is an opportunity for us to fix part of that problem, and that is why the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Dooley) and myself have introduced this amendment. The amendment requires lenders to provide consumers with the information they need to make informed decisions.Specifically, they would have to do several things. They would have to indicate the minimum payment and day that the payment is due on every periodic statement that they send. They would have to indicate what the late penalty deadlines are so that consumers have all the information they need in order to make that appropriate decision and meet their responsibilities and in order to avoid the imposition of late fees. And whenever a solicitation includes an introductory rate, it must be clear when that rate expires.I think these and some of the other small steps make it much better to avoid bankruptcy on the part of many consumers and users of credit.",

President Lee has amassed a number of accomplishments throughout the last three years.Of all the contemporary leaders that the Republic of China has had, President Lee Teng-hui stands out due to his exceptional ability to guide his nation through the transition to a democratic republic. Furthermore, the effects of the severe financial crisis which have affected much of Asia have been much less severe in Taiwan. This discrepancy can be attributed to President Lee Teng-hui's ability to maintain a stable democratic environment which has allowed a solid foundation for its economy to grow. In addition, he has given his people hope and optimism in Taiwan's ability to confront the future.President Lee Teng-hui has also made great efforts in trying to reach out to his compatriots on the Chinese mainland. Unfortunately, his gestures of friendship have been answered with lukewarm responses at best from the PRC leadership. However, President Lee Teng-hui refuses to give up his hope of seeing a free and unified China in the future and continues to pursue a policy to that end. His persistence is a sign of his dedication to democracy and is greatly appreciated by the Western world, and in particular the United States.I wish President Lee Teng-hui every success in the future. He is a respected leader of a free, prosperous and democratic country and deserves no less than our full support.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to note the accomplishments of Mimi Moskowitz, who will be honored by the Bayside Jewish Center, of Queens County, New York, at a testimonial dinner on Monday, June 7.Mimi is stepping down after two years as President of the Sisterhood of the Bayside Jewish Center, but she will continue to play an active role in the synagogue, as she has done for the past 22 years.Since moving to Bayside from the Bronx in 1977, Mimi Moskowitz has plowed her energy and her limitless talent into the fundraising efforts and entertainment programs of the Bayside Jewish Center. For many years, she co-chaired the synagogue's highly successful New Year's Eve Dinner Dances. These annual events were routinely sold out, and attracted party-goers throughout New York City and Long Island.In addition, Mimi served the Bayside Sisterhood as Program Vice President and Ways and Means Vice President, prior to her tenure as Sisterhood President. She has coordinated numerous Shabbat Dinners, Holiday Hootenannies, This is Your Life tributes, and Purim Parties; has helped edit the synagogue newsletter, the Voice; and has produced countless promotional flyers. The hours of service she has spent volunteering in the synagogue office are too numerous to count.Before arriving in Bayside, Mimi honed her talents in service to the B'nai B'rith of Co-op City, and the Sisterhood of the Castle Hill Jewish Community Center.However, Mimi Moskowitz is perhaps best known for her inventive song parodies and poems, which have been the hit of many an enjoyable evening at Jewish Centers in Queens and the Bronx for more than four decades. Who can forget such classics as Passover is Coming to Town, It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Purim, I'm Dreaming of a Full Sukka, or her seminal work, the full-length production of South Passaic? Indeed, Mimi is believed to be the only person ever to use the phrase Bronx Press Review in a rhyming lyric!Mr. Speaker, Mimi's legions of friends will be flocking to the Bayside Jewish Center on June 7 to honor her for her tireless devotion, boundless energy and limitless service to her synagogue and her community. I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me now in honoring Mimi Moskowitz, congratulating her on the occasion of her testimonial, and extending our best wishes to her for her future health and success.",

    "title": "CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AUTHORIZING CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT PHYSICAL DESECRATION OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, our Founding Fathers must be very puzzled looking down on us today. Instead of seeing us dealing with the very real challenges that face our Nation, they see us laboring under this compulsion to amend the document that underpins our democracy.They see a house of dwarfs trying to give this government a great new power at the expense of the people, the power for the first time to stifle dissent.The threat must be great, they must be saying, to justify changing the Bill of Rights and, for the first time, decreasing rather than increasing the rights of the people. They see their beloved Bill of Rights being eroded into the Bill of Rights and Restrictions.What is the threat? What is the threat? Madam Speaker, I ask again, what is the threat? Is our democracy at risk? What is the crisis to the Republic? What is the challenge to our way of life? Where is our belief system being threatened? Are people jumping from behind parked cars, waiving burning flags at us, trying to prevent us from getting to work and causing America to grind to a halt?Do we really believe that we are under such a siege because of a few loose cannons? Do we need to change our Constitution to save our democracy? Or, Madam Speaker, are we offended?The real threat to our society is not the occasional burning of a flag, but the permanent banning of the burners. The real threat is that some of us have now mistaken the flag for a religious icon to be worshipped as pagans would, rather than to keep it as the beloved symbol of our freedom that is to be cherished.These rare but vile acts of desecration that have been cited by those who would propose changing our founding document do not threaten anybody. If a jerk burns a flag, America is not threatened. If a jerk burns a flag, democracy is not under siege. If a jerk burns a flag, freedom is not at risk and we are not threatened. My colleagues, we are offended. To change our Constitution because someone offends us is in itself unconscionable.The Nazis, Madam Speaker, the Nazis and the fascists and the imperial Japanese army combined could not diminish the rights of even one single American. Yet, in an act of cowardice, Madam Speaker, we are about to do what they could not.Where are the patriots? Where are the patriots? Where are the patriots? Whatever happened to fighting to the death for somebody's right to disagree? We now choose, instead, to react by taking away the right to protest. Even a despicable low-life malcontent has a right to disagree, and he has a right to disagree in an obnoxious fashion if he wishes. That is the true test of free expression, and we are about to fail that test.Real patriots choose freedom over symbolism. That is the ultimate contest between substance and form. Why does the flag need protecting? Is it an endangered species? Burning one flag or burning 1,000 flags does not endanger it. It is a symbol. But change just one word of our Constitution of this great Nation, and it and we will never be the same.We cannot destroy a symbol. Yes, people have burnt the flag, but, Madam Speaker, there it is again right in back of the Speaker's chair. It goes on. It cannot be destroyed. It represents our beliefs.Now poets and patriots will tell us that men have died for the flag. But that language itself, Madam Speaker, that language itself is symbolic. People do not die for symbols. They fight and die for freedom. They fight and die for democracy. They fight and die for values. They fight and die for the flag means to fight and die for the cause in which we believe. My colleagues would have us change that.We love and we honor and respect our flag for that which it represents. It is different from all other flags. I notice in the amendment that we do not make it illegal to burn some other country's flags, and that is because our flag is different. No, it is not because of the colors or the shape or the design. They are all relatively the same.Our flag is unique, because it represents our unique values. It represents tolerance for dissent. This country was founded by dissenters that others found to be obnoxious.What is a dissenter? In this case, it is a social protester who feels so strongly about an issue that he would stoop so low as to try to get under our skin, to try to rile us up, to prove his point, and to have us react by making this great Nation less than it was.How do we react? Dictators and dictatorships make political prisoners out of those who burn their Nation's flags, not democracies. We tolerate dissent and dissenters, even the despicable dissenters.What is the flag, Madam Speaker? The American flag? Yes, it is a piece of cloth. It is red and white and blue, and it has 50 stars and 13 stripes. But if we pass this amendment and desecrators decide to go into a cottage industry and make flags with 55 stars and burn them, will we rush to the floor to amend our Constitution again?If they add a stripe or two and set it ablaze, it surely looks like our flag, but is it? Do we rush in and count the stripes before determining whether or not we are constitutionally offended? What if the stripes are orange instead of red? How do we interrupt that? What mischief do we do here? If it is a full-size color picture of a flag they burn, is it a crime to desecrate a symbol of a symbol? What are we doing?Our beloved flag represents this great Nation, Madam Speaker. We love our flag. Because there is a Republic for which it stands, made great by a Constitution that we want to protect, a Constitution given to our care by giants and about to be nibbled to death by dwarfs.Madam Speaker, I call upon the patriots of the House to rise and defend the Constitution, resist the temptation to drape ourselves in the flag, and hold sacred the Bill of Rights. Defend our Constitution. Defeat this amendment.",

    "text": "Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, and I do so reluctantly only because of the great respect that I have for the sponsors of the amendment, both the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey). Let me start for a moment at the beginning, if I may, to just give the framework of what this is really all about. North Korea is a rather isolated country, probably the most isolated country on the planet Earth. It is a country that the very few of us who have been there have come to realize is almost like a country in a bubble. They are absolutely paranoid.Madam Chairman, 99.9 percent of the people have never been outside of their country, including the leadership of the country. The people have no idea what is going on in the real world, and they have all been indoctrinated and brainwashed into believing that the entire world is lined up against them and the United States and South Korea at any moment about to invade their country and usurp their way of life.It is very difficult to deal and to negotiate with the North Koreans who have very, very little experience in the field of dealing with the outside world, let alone the ability to negotiate the way most societies can.There came a time, Madam Chairman, when we and others were very fearful of the very fact that North Korea had nuclear capability; that it had nuclear reactors; that it was producing nuclear energy; that these were heavy-water nuclear reactors; and that these reactors were producing weapons-grade plutonium that could be used in weapons of mass destruction.At around that time, Madam Chairman, discussions were held with Kim Il Sung, the then leader of North Korea, in which he and others within his government were persuaded that it would be in their best interests if they were allowed because of their financial need and because of their great desire to get assistance, to be able to do away with their very dangerous heavy-water reactors and exchange those heavy-water reactors for light-water reactors.The difference between those two kinds of reactors, Madam Chair, is that the light-water reactors make it very difficult, if not impossible, to produce nuclear weapons-grade materiel. The world would be much safer if they had light-water reactors rather than the heavy-water reactors which were, indeed, already producing this fissionable material.The North Koreans entered into an agreement only on certain terms. They said, if we turn off our heavy-water reactors in order to substitute light-water reactors during the interregnum, we will have no power for our poor country, after making tremendous investment in the heavy-water reactors, albeit for reasons of energy as well as producing weapons of mass destruction. So they had a mixed reason.But they were willing at that time and signed an agreement that said they were willing to swap. But what happens to us, they asked realistically, in the meantime, when we have no power to run our plants and to meet the energy needs of our country?We led an international consortium that was put together, mainly funded by our friends in Japan and South Korea, in which they said, those other countries said, we will put up the billions of dollars to build the reactor. The North Koreans want the prestige of U.S. leadership and participation, and the U.S. at that time agreed that we would supply them with the money for oil and other alternative sources of energy other than nuclear while they closed down one reactor system and substituted it for another. That is good common sense. This is a very small investment on our part financially, and especially compared to the huge commitment being made by our other international partners in what is known as KEDO. We have been working on that.What this amendment would do is this amendment would take away our ability to participate in the project that switches the heavy- to the light-water reactors.Madam Chairman, if the goal today is to see North Korea resume its nuclear weapons program, using their heavy-water reactors, then we should vote for the amendment with the gentleman from New York, because that is the likely outcome of adopting that amendment. By unilaterally adding new criteria to this agreed framework, the amendment sets out conditions that the President cannot possibly certify. It guarantees failure. The amendment requires the President to certify North Korean intentions instead of actions.Who in their right mind would certify anybody else's intentions, let alone the intentions of North Korea? It is their actions that we should be asking the President to certify.In addition, the amendment requires the President to certify North Korean adherence to the joint declaration on denuclearization, an agreement that the U.S. is not even a party to. The adoption of this amendment will tell our allies in Seoul and Tokyo that we are not prepared to follow through on our commitments. It will also confirm, unfortunately, the worst distorted suspicions of the North Koreans who already believe that we never intended to uphold our portion of the agreement.Madam Chairman, the underlying assumptions of this amendment is that the administration has not been tough with North Korea in demanding that they adhere to the agreed framework. In fact, as the inspection of the suspected site at Kamchang-Ri indicated, where everybody thought they were rebuilding their original nuclear facilities and which proved to be a vast, empty, cavernous system of caves, we found that the administration is holding North Korea to its commitments.The purpose of the agreed framework was to freeze the North Korean nuclear program and it has done so. That is an inconvenient fact for my friends on the other side of this issue; but nonetheless, it is the fact. The fastest way to unfreeze that program is to abandon the agreed framework as this amendment would do.Madam Chairman, I ask my colleagues to seriously consider whether the world is more secure if North Korea has nuclear weapons. I think not, Madam Chairman; and therefore, I urge all of my colleagues in the House to oppose this amendment.",

Well, guess what? India does that. Mr. Chairman, 77 percent of the votes in the United Nations, 70 percent of the time that they have an issue, it is done by consensus, with the agreement of India, along with the United States and the other people represented in the United Nations. What the gentleman refers to as only some recorded votes are quite different than all of the matters considered by the United Nations.Votes in the United Nations on U.S. aid should not be used to reward somebody in order to bribe them to vote the way we think. India is a thriving democracy, the world's largest democracy.In addition to that, this would be a terrible time to send that message. This would ironically reward Pakistan, that has just invaded India's side of the line of control in Kashmir and Jammu.

    "title": "25TH ANNIVERSARY OF TURKEY'S INVASION OF CYPRUS",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today marks the 25th anniversary of Turkey's invasion of Cyprus, and I rise with my colleagues to sadly commemorate this tragic event. I have always supported efforts, including legislation, calling for the end of the tragic separation of the island of Cyprus. I am proud to be a cosponsor of important legislation calling for a just and peaceful resolution to the current situation on Cyprus (H. Con. Res. 81), and have also called for an immediate end to the militarization of Cyprus. I have also written to President Clinton numerous times to point out instances of Turkish aggression on the island. Lastly, I have also supported the Republic of Cyprus's application for entry into the European Union.It goes without saying that the situation on Cyprus is of great importance to the United States and to me. The appointment of Ambassador Richard Beady as special emissary for Cyprus demonstrates this importance to the Clinton Administration. I believe that after 25 years of stagnation, the situation on Cyprus demands a fair and comprehensive solution. The UN Security Council has condemned the declaration of independence by the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and has called for the withdrawal of all Turkish troops. The Security Council also called on all states not to recognize the purported state of the ``Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.''In fact, no country in the world recognizes the so-called ``TRNC'' except for Turkey. UN resolutions since 1974 have called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Cyprus, the return of all refugees to their homes in safety, and respect for the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity of the Republic of Cyprus. Several rounds of negotiation have taken place, all of which have failed because of a lack of political will on the Turkish side and its refusal to abide by international law and to comply with Security Council resolutions.Turkey has also continued to upgrade its military presence on Cyprus despite the fact that the Republic of Cyprus decided recently not to deploy Russian S-300 missiles on Cyprus. The TRNC has further blocked progress by setting two preconditions for the resumption of peace talks by requiring the recognition of the ``TRNC'', and the withdrawal of Cyprus' application for membership in the European Union. Neither of these are acceptable to the Republic of Cyprus, and only serve to continue to block any kind of possible resolution.I therefore call on this Administration, in this 25th year, to take a hard sand on Cyprus, to help enable the people of Cyprus to live under a government chosen by their people. The United States must take the lead in finding a solution to Cyprus, and demonstrate to the world that people of different ethnic backgrounds and religious beliefs can successfully coexist. The people yearn for it and the country needs it.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I think we are seeing a rather unique occurrence here on the floor today. Indeed, we usually enjoy doing battle with the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton). He sometimes is really a lone warrior on this issue, the overwhelming majority of the House of Representatives voting against his amendment. But, nonetheless, we have never come to the point where we have forced him into a full retreat on the floor of the House, and that is too bad, because we do appreciate hearing his point of view, in the minority though it might be.The gentleman's amendment is being withdrawn because it is flawed, as is his logic, as are his arguments. The gentleman's intent, as it usually is, is to come to the floor, as he has time and time again, to bash India. And his intent here was to cut aid. And, instead, the flawed amendment would indeed allow an increase in aid to be sent to India. Instead of sending a letter bomb, had his amendment passed, he would have sent a Valentine's card.The gentleman's intent was basically to hurt the most vulnerable people of the Indian society. Our assistance programs help children and the elderly and pregnant women. The gentleman from Indiana comes to the floor as a champion of human rights. Does he not know that in Kashmir there is an elected government, democratically elected; a government that is under continuous assault from secessionist terrorists who are responsible for numerous serious abuses, including extrajudicial executions, torture, kidnapping and extortion?Mr. Chairman, the fountainhead of human rights violations in Kashmir is state-sponsored terrorism from across the border in Kashmir. Just recently, we bore witness yet again to the fact that India was being victimized by an egregious invasion of forces from across the border in Pakistan. This invasion would have become a full-fledged war but for the commendable restraint shown by New Delhi. India has demonstrated that it is a responsible nuclear power, that it does not get provoked easily, and it knows that real power means acting with restraint.India should be recognized for its exceptional conduct during the recent Kargil aggression. This amendment of the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton) does just the opposite.Who are the people terrorizing that he speaks of? These people are terrorizing the peace-loving people of the Indian state of Jammu Kashmir, Hindus and Muslims alike. They are the victims of terrorism for the last several years. It is terror that is unbridled and violent, and it is let loose by the Mujahidin members brought in from all over the world from overseas and aided and given arms by the Pakistanis. That is the real cause for human rights abuses in Kashmir.Mr. Chairman, the real violators of human rights in Kashmir are the numerous terrorist outfits owing allegiance for the fundamentalist religious groups. It is these religious fanatics belonging to such groups as the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, recruited, trained and unleashed by Osama bin Laden and his terror network, who are fanning the flames of human rights violations in Kashmir. The Indian troops that are there are there to maintain the peace and stability of their State of Jammu and Kashmir.The rights that the gentleman from New York (Mr. Burton) would seek to protect are the rights of Mr. Bin Laden, who has blown up U.S. embassies all over the world. Is that who we are concerned about? I think not. It is these terrorist groups and training camps that we have to target, not Democratic India, as violators of human rights.India is a beacon of unity and diversity. It is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-cultural, and multi-religious civilization with a commendable record of tolerance.This is not the time, as the gentleman of Indiana (Mr. Burton) recognizes, to bring this amendment up. It is not the time to bash India and to reward Pakistan. It is not time to punish the victims and to reward the aggressors.",

First let me thank Mr. Gejdenson, Mr. Lantos, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Hastings for co-sponsoring this resolution.Mr. Speaker, the contrasting events in India and Pakistan over a single 24 hour period speak eloquently about the new challenges and opportunities that we face in South Asia. In India, we have seen hundreds of millions of voters enthusiastically exercise their votes in a free and fair election. In Pakistan, we witnessed a military coup.This resolution, Mr. Speaker, recognizes that the people of India have a deep and abiding commitment to democracy and it salutes them for the passion with which they choose their own destiny. No country reflects our own values more in that part of the world than does India.It is high time we seriously begin to recognize this fact and graduate from mere platitudes to some tangible policy changes toward India.I believe that it is time to re-examine our basic premise regarding U.S. policy in South Asia. We should abandon old paradigms and Cold War hangups and see that India, a democracy, is our natural ally in the region.The best way to demonstrate our commitment to the people of India is by ensuring that the President travels to India as soon as possible, as the resolution urges him to do.I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.",

Schreiber High School, in Port Washington, NY. Her award-winning computer science project was chosen from over 1,500 submitted entries, reviewed by a board of ten distinguished scientists who judged the entries for their research ability, scientific originality and creative thinking.Using DNA as the medium, Viviana studied steganography, a data encryption technique that embeds secret computer messages within large amounts of seemingly innocent information. For her molecular computing project, Viviana encrypted the secret message ``JUNE 6__INVASION: NORMANDY,'' and then inserted it in the gene sequence of a DNA strand.Over the years, more than 115,000 students from American high schools in all 50 states and overseas have completed independent research projects and submitted entries. More than 100 of the world's most coveted science and math honors have been won by alumni of this program. Five finalists of this contest have gone on to win the Nobel Prize, and thirty have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences.I had the pleasure of meeting Viviana while she was in Washington, D.C. for the final phase of this year's competition. Viviana is a talented young woman and she is a fine example of the amazing potential of our nation's youth.Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me today in congratulating Viviana Risca upon receiving the first place-prize for her outstanding scientific capabilities and tremendous innovation.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant support of H.R. 3908. With this bill, we are today embarking on a new course in our involvement in the counter-narcotics effort in Colombia. I support the bill because I believe we have an obligation to support democracies when they are threatened. Colombia is the oldest democracy in Latin America and is clearly under siege.But Colombia is not fighting a traditional insurgency whose followers claim some ideological justification for violence. It was once that way, but it isn't anymore. The guerrilla movements in Colombia have abandoned their ideology and instead provide protection to the narcotics traffickers who poison our children. The guerrillas also resort to kidnaping and extortion. From both these activities, the guerrillas generate substantial income making them the best funded insurgency probably in the history of the world. So the first point I would make to my colleagues is that we should be clear about the real purpose of this bill. It is not only to support a counter-narcotics strategy, it also supports a counter-insurgency strategy. It is designed to punish the guerrillas and their drug-trafficking allies in order to drive the guerrillas to the negotiating table and, with luck, arrest the traffickers.We also need to consider who we are providing our assistance to. The Colombia national police have an outstanding human rights record. They are an organization we should be proud to assist. But the bulk of this package will go to the Colombian military, which has one of the worst human rights records in the hemisphere. On top of that, there are credible allegations of ongoing cooperation between elements of the Colombian military and the paramilitary organizations. The good news is that our assistance will be provided to battalions that have been vetted and trained by us. In addition, it appears to me that the leadership of the Colombian military genuinely wants to address human rights issues. We should demand that our assistance be contingent on genuine efforts to arrest and prosecute abusers of human rights.Lastly, I am concerned about the direction of our counter-narcotics strategy. As we have seen in Bolivia and Peru, when there is success with eradication and interdiction in one area the traffic merely moves to another area. In a very real sense, much of the turmoil in Colombia is our fault. Our citizens consume the drugs grown and produced in Colombia, and unless we intensify our efforts to reduce demand here, a supply-side strategy is doomed to failure.In a larger sense, we are faced with a choice all of us would prefer not to make. None of us wants to become more deeply involved in another civil conflict in Latin America, yet doing nothing imperils not only Colombia but her immediate neighbors as well.On balance, I believe we should support the assistance package to Colombia as the best of the options available but we should understand the obligations this policy places on us and we should be aware that we will be involved in Colombia for a very long time.",

    "title": "A TRIBUTE TO REPRESENTATIVE STEVEN CHEN",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I want to call to the attention of my colleagues an article regarding Representative Steven Chen, who serves as the head of the Taipei Cultural and Economic Representative Office in Washington. The article, which ran in today's New York Times, is a fitting tribute to Taiwan's unofficial Ambassador, who has worked diligently to promote and expand relations between the United States and the 22 million citizens of Taiwan.Mr. Speaker, Ambassador Chen is a thorough professional who has enjoyed a long and distinguished life as a career diplomat. He has represented his government all over the world, including postings in the Philippines, Brazil, Argentina, and Bolivia. His experience in the United States also is extensive. During the past 25 years, Ambassador Chen served in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, and he has spent the last three years as the Representative in Washington, DC.Mr. Speaker, I am certain my colleagues would agree that Steven Chen's charm and quiet demeanor have served Taiwan well. Whether meeting Members of Congress in their offices or Executive Branch officials in a more neutral setting, Ambassador Chen has always worked to make certain the United States and Taiwan remain strong friends.Mr. Speaker, as the article notes, Ambassador Chen is planning to retire shortly. I am certain all of my colleagues join me in congratulating Steven Chen on a distinguished diplomatic career. We in the Congress are indeed fortunate to know him, and we wish him well in the years ahead.Washington.--At an embassy that is not an embassy, the ambassador who is not an ambassador can only imagine what it is like to be a full-fledged member of Washington's diplomatic corps. ``In the evenings, you attend cocktail parties, champagne dances,'' Stephen Chen said wistfully of the black-tie world from which he is largely excluded. ``This is the very routine, beautiful picture of the diplomat in a textbook.'' Mr. Chen, the director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, the de facto embassy here for the government of Taiwan, is a charming pariah. While he represents the interests of 22 million of the freest and richest people in Asia, the 66-year-old diplomat might as well be invisible, at least as far as many of the State Department's China experts are concerned. The snubs, Mr. Chen suggested, are an obvious effort to appease Beijing, and they are more than a little unfair to a government that is only weeks away from a peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected leader to another, the first time that has happened in almost 5,000 years of Chinese history. ``There is a kind of unfairness,'' Mr. Chen tells a visitor, the wall behind his desk decorated with a painting of the delicate blossoms of the winter plum, Taiwan's national flower. ``We have been a model student for freedom, democracy and a market economy.'' ``We don't mind if the United States has rapprochement with mainland China--we think it's good to bring the P.R.C. into the family of civilizations,'' he says of the People's Republic of China, Because the United States has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan and has recognized the Communist government in Beijing as the sole representative of the people of China, Mr. Chen and his staff of nearly 200 are barred from the premises of the State Department. They are not invited to diplomatic receptions at the White House, or to most of the dinner parties and glittery balls held at the embassies of nations that recognize Beijing. When Taiwanese diplomats want to talk with Clinton administration officials, the meetings are often held in hotel coffee shops. ``We must meet in a neutral setting, that is the rule,'' says Mr. Chen, explaining the awkward logistics of the job. Relations with China have been especially jittery since Taiwan's election last month of the new president, Chen Shui- bian, a former democracy activist who long advocated Taiwan's independence and whose victory ended half a century of Nationalist rule. On the eve of the election, Chinese leaders all but warned of an invasion if Mr. Chen and his party were victorious. Since the election, both Mr. Chen and Beijing have softened their rhetoric, and Mr. Chen has recently insisted that he sees no need for an independence declaration. Stephen Chen, who is not related to the new president, welcomes the moderated rhetoric from Taiwan's new government. The Communist leaders in Beijing, he says, would strike only ``if they should be unnecessarily provoked.'' ``We have been dealing with them for more than 60 years,'' he said. ``We know when they are bluffing, when they are not bluffing. If we don't give them an excuse, I don't think they're going to attack.'' Mr. Chen, who was born in the Chinese city of Nanjing, last saw the mainland in 1949, when his family was on the run from the victorious Communist forces of Mao Zedong. They fled to Taiwan, his father a diplomat in the service of the Nationalist leader, Chiang Kai-shek. His father was assigned to the embassy in the Philippines when Mr. Chen was 15, and he remained there for more than a decade, attending college in Manila, marrying his Chinese- Filipino high school sweetheart and becoming fluent in English. In 1960, he returned to Taiwan and passed the foreign service exam. He was first sent to Rio de Janeiro, and then to Argentina and Bolivia. In 1973, he was named consul general to Atlanta, where he remained until the United States severed relations with Taiwan and recognized Beijing six years later. Mr. Chen said he can remember sitting in his living room in Atlanta, watching the televised announcement by President Carter that the ``It seemed very unfair,'' he continued. ``It was as if the United States wanted to reward a bad guy, the lousy student, and to punish the good student. That was my feeling.'' In the years since, he said, Taiwanese diplomats have learned how to innovate, especially in Washington, where they employ some of the city's most powerful lobbyists and retain close ties to many prominent conservative members of Congress. Mr. Chen says his office has an annual budget for lobbying of about $1.2 million and contracts with 15 firms. ``They help open doors, they make appointments for us,'' he said. ``But we make the presentations.'' Under a 1979 law, Taiwan can continue to buy American weapons. And Mr. Chen has been a frequent visitor to Capitol Hill in recent weeks as his government seeks Congressional approval for the sale of a wish list of sophisticated weapons. ``If we are deprived of basic defensive weapons, then of course we are thrown to the wolves,'' he said. Mr. Chen is considering a visit to the lair of the wolves. After 40 years in the diplomatic service, he is nearing retirement, and he is planning a vacation on the mainland, which is now permitted. ``I tell you very frankly, I would like to see the Great Wall,'' he said. ``This belongs to the legacy of China. It has nothing to do with Communism.''",

    "title": "THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am honored to join with so many of my colleagues in recalling the horrors visited upon the Armenian people and to take a stand against those who would deny the past in order to shape the future. The Armenian Genocide, which occurred between 1915 and 1923, resulted in the deliberate death of 1.5 million human souls, killed for the crime of their own existence.A shocking forerunner of still greater slaughter to come in the 20th century, the Armenian Genocide marked a critical point in history, when technology and ideology combined with the power of the state to make war on an entire people. The Ottoman Empire's campaign to eliminate the whole of the Armenian population existing within its borders was no accident, no mistake made by a minor functionary. Genocide was official policy and 1.5 million corpses were the result. The innocent, the harmless, the blameless, without regard to age, sex or status, they were the victims of deportation, starvation and massacre.When we here, in the House of Representatives, recall the deaths of the innocent of Armenia, we stand as witnesses to history and recognize the common bond of humanity. We acknowledge not just Armenians, but all the victims of vicious nationalism, ethnic and religious hatred, and pathological ideologies. The double tragedy of the Armenian Genocide, is first, that 1.5 million lives were snuffed out, and second, that the world, including the United States, not only did nothing, but again stood by as genocide took place on an even vaster scale across Europe only 16 years later.``Never again.'' This is the simple lesson we as a nation have learned from the unprecedented slaughter of the innocent in the last century. Our armed forces are serving nobly around the world to make this dictum more than just words. If we are to be a just and honorable nation, we must do more than shrug our shoulders at atrocities. We, as a nation, must bear witness to history, and having acknowledged the horrors of the past, commit ourselves to preventing their repetition.Mr. Speaker, I am here today for one simple reason: to recall publicly that eighty-five years ago one-third of the Armenian people were put to death for the crime of their own existence. To deny this reality is to murder them again. We can not, we must not, allow their deaths to be stripped of meaning by allowing the crime committed against them to slowly slip into the mists of lost memory.Thanks to the strength and commitment of America's citizens of Armenian descent, their memory will not be lost. The victims of the Armenian Genocide will not be forgotten. I'd also like to commend and thank my colleagues Congressmen John Porter and Frank Pallone, the co-chairmen of the Congressional Caucus of Armenian Issues. Thanks to their leadership, this House has again honorably fulfilled America's commitment to memory and justice. Mr. GILMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am honored that my colleagues have invited me to join in today's special order commemorating the tragic events that began in 1915.I know how important this commemoration is to those Armenian-Americans descended from the survivors of the massacres carried out during World War I, almost eighty-five years ago.Indeed, hundreds of thousands of Armenians died at that time as a result of brutal actions taken by the Turkish Ottoman Empire.While the men and women who died during those tragic days would not live to see it, the Armenian nation has now re-emerged, despite the suffering its people endured under the Ottoman Empire and during the following eight decades of communist dictatorship under the former Soviet Union.As I have said before, the independent state of Armenia stands today as clear proof that indeed the Armenian people have survived the challenges of the past--and will survive the challenges of the future as well.Through assistance and diplomatic support, the United States is helping Armenia to build a new future.Today, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join us in looking to the past and in commemorating those hundreds of thousands of innocents who lost their lives some eighty-five years ago.",

    "text": "There are a lot of things fishy going on on the floor today, Mr. Chairman.The gentleman from Connecticut I think might know that I personally did go to North Korea, and I did begin the negotiation with the then dictator of North Korea, Kim Il Song, and it was a very difficult conversation, believe me. It was at a time when they were fully active with their heavy water nuclear reactor, when they were refusing to let the IAEA in to do the inspections and we had those constant standoffs at the airport and they did not want to budge.To get them finally to agree that they would build down and take away and do away with their heavy-water reactor and switch to a light-water reactor, which we wanted them to do which would reduce the possibility of nuclear risk was a very difficult thing. The only thing that they wanted from us in return is to have the face, to be able to save face and not be able to say, well, the South Koreans and the Japanese of who they are not enamored with were bailing them out.They wanted it to look like an international effort. So our contribution is basically funding the oil to heat their country while one reactor is turned off and the other one is turned on.This is really about trying to embarrass the Clinton administration. This is really about establishing a strawman, a bogeyman to have an enemy to rally around and the North Koreans are very, very easy suspects to fill that role. What is going on here is basically to tear down the framework agreement. If we did not have the framework agreement, Mr. Chairman, this would be a much more dangerous world in which we live. This is critical that we go through with this. If this fails and they go back to their heavy-water reactor, where will we be? We will really need every bit of that $60 billion for Star Wars and all of those other things that we are talking about. This is the ounce of prevention that will save us megatons of cure.",

    "title": "URGING COMPLIANCE WITH HAGUE CONVENTION ON CIVIL ASPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the House Concurrent Resolution, H. Con. Res. 293, which calls on parties to the Hague Convention on Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction to abide by the provisions of that agreement.The State Department reports that nearly 1,000 children a year are abducted by a parent and taken outside of the United States. According to a report recently released by the General Accounting Office, despite the efforts of the Federal Government, Americans have little chance of regaining custody of children abducted by a parent and taken to a foreign country. Success in these tragic situations is often elusive because it largely depends on the willingness of foreign governments to cooperate.The 1980 Hague Convention outlines procedures for resolving international child abduction disputes among 54 countries. However, international child abduction remains a serious problem. The denial of parental visitation of children, and the failure of several contacting countries to fully implement the Convention, deprives the Hague Convention of the spirit of mutual confidence upon which its success depends. Countries that deny parents access to their own children merely reward abducting parents and endangers the well-being of abducted children for the rest of their lives.Several families in my Congressional District in New York have personally experienced the terrible psychological and financial strains of international child abduction. The wrongful retention of American children abroad touches not only left-behind parents and their families but also our entire Nation.Mr. Speaker, it is time that we all focus our collective attention on missing children and support H. Con. Res. 293 Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 293, which calls on nations that are signatories to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction to live up to their treaty obligations. I am an original cosponsor of this legislation, and I commend the gentlemen from Texas [Mr. Lampson] and Ohio [Mr. Chabot] for their work on this issue.This issue was brought home to me by one of my constituents, Tom Sylvester of Blue Ash, Ohio. Tom's daughter Carina was taken by his Austrian-born wife on October 30, 1995. Although both the Austrian Central Authority and the Austrian Supreme Court ruled that Carina should be returned to the United States and to Tom's custody, the ruling was never enforced. The only contacts Tom has had with his daughter are a few brief supervised meetings in Austria, and his phone calls to her are always placed on a speaker phone, undoubtedly being monitored.Although the Hague Convention has helped in getting a just decision rendered, the United States currently has no way to force another country to enforce its own laws and judicial decisions within its own borders. In fact, the United States has no recourse if another participating member country does not live up to its obligations under the Convention.I have been working with the State and Justice Departments on Mr. Sylvester's behalf since July of 1998, and I can tell you that it has been a difficult and discouraging process. What is most frustrating is that Mr. Sylvester has done everything correctly under the terms of the Hague Convention, and still, more than four years later, he has been able to spend only a few precious minutes with his young daughter. He cannot even get the Austrian authorities to grant him an agreed upon visitation schedule, and have instead subjected him to a number of indignities.We owe it to Tom Sylvester and thousands of other parents who have suffered the same difficulties as he has to pass this resolution today. And I urge my colleagues to let this be the first of many steps needed to return these American children to their rightful homes.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mary Petro as she is honored by the Jefferson Democratic Club of Flushing for her many years of dedicated service as a District Leader.The Jefferson Club is one of the oldest Democratic clubs in Queens County, New York. Mary Petro served valiantly and with great distinction as a District Leader from 1976 until she stepped down last year. In this capacity, Mary played an instrumental role in local New York City politics for nearly a quarter of a century, through devoted service to her community, to the Borough of Queens, to the Jefferson Club and to the Queens County Democratic Organization. Mary's service to her community and her involvement in civic affairs are legendary in the Borough of Queens.In 1968, Mary moved to Flushing, and immediately became an active member of the community. Mary has volunteered her time and her energies to countless community organizations and charitable endeavors, preeminently among them the Police Athletic League. For her work as the chief PAL fund-raiser for the 109th Precinct, and as an officer of the 109th Precinct's Community Council, Mary was named a ``Civilian Patrolman of the Month.''Despite her tireless community service, Mary Petro has been a faithful employee of Con Edison for more than four decades, and a caring and devoted wife to her husband, Jimmy, for more than 30 years.Mr. Speaker, I have had the pleasure of knowing Mary Petro for a quarter of a century. I have been constantly amazed by her boundless energy, and her innumerable good works done on behalf of her community and her party.Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me now in extending our thanks and appreciation to Mary Petro as she is honored by the Jefferson Democratic Club of Flushing for her many years of service to the people of Queens County.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I am in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana. I only regret that we do not have as much time to put the light of truth to so many of the things that he said, because we have not been given equal time in this debate.That being said, the House has rejected the gentleman's amendment on repeated occasions, and I do hope and expect it will do so again today. I think it should be clear to all by now that punishing India by cutting our assistance is not a policy that this U.S. Congress will adopt.The Burton amendment is the wrong amendment at the wrong time. In the wake of the President's successful visit to India, the U.S. and India have a new opportunity to build a broad-based relationship. Instead of applauding India for establishing a joint working group with the U.S. to fight against terrorism, the amendment would punish India by cutting crucial assistance.The gentleman makes a great many allegations about human rights abuses in India, but conveniently ignores the fact that the people of India are the major victims of terrorism perpetrated by groups supported and trained in Pakistan and associated with Osama bin-Ladin. In fact, after the Kargil incursion and the hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane to Afghanistan, the Pakistani-backed terrorists have stepped up their attacks on innocent civilians and security forces in Kashmir.To characterize India's struggle against terrorism as a violation of human rights is not only unjust, but also provides aid and comfort to the terrorists who have claimed thousands of innocent victims in India. That there are things that go wrong in any civilized society, including India, are true, and some of the things the gentleman points out are true, but these are not done by the government of India.Mr. Chairman, churches are bombed and burned here. People are killed every day here. Women are raped every day of the year here. These things are terrible, but it does not mean that our government is responsible. The best way for us to help India continue to improve its human rights record is to engage in positive and constructive dialogue, one great democracy to another, not with punitive sanctions and cuts.The momentum that we have gained in relations by the President's visit needs to be strengthened and sustained. For Congress to act now to stigmatize India for alleged human rights abuses would send the wrong signal to the 1 billion democratic people in India. I urge all of our colleagues to reject this amendment.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 531 and would like to add my voice to those marking the sixth anniversary of the cowardly bombing of the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aries, Argentina. This searing event horrified the world and has, unfortunately, become a barometer for the political culture of Argentina.While we commend the statements of interest and commitment made by President Fernando de la Rua, I, along with many in this House, remain wary, in light of the six years of stumbling, ineffectual investigation and the reality of justice denied. The truth in this matter points unmistakably to elements within the Argentine state and unfortunately, this reality has been a source of delay and obfuscation rather than a catalyst for action by Agentine investigators.In addition to this disturbing procrastination on the part of investigators to dig deep into the roots of official involvement, the search for justice in Argentina has also skipped lightly over the possible involvement of Hizbollah, Iran and Syria. Notwithstanding the myriad statements pledging an absolute commitment to the search for truth and justice, the reality of the Argentine investigation has been a half-hearted, poorly funded, undermanned, uninspired, slow-motion search for answers.Mr. Speaker, six years ago in Buenos Aires, 86 people were killed and hundreds more were injured by a car bomb created and delivered by an unknown group of conspirators, who targeted their victims because of their Jewish faith. Cowardly and offensive, the bombing of the AMIA Jewish Community Center came little more than two years after the bombing of the Israeli embassy in the same city. By all accounts, Argentina's response to these two horrific crimes has been lackadaisical and disappointing. The victims of these crimes, old and young, male and female, deserve better than to have their quest for justice fade in a bureaucratic haze.I want to commend my colleagues Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen and Congressman Lantos for their excellent leadership on this important resolution, which I strongly urge this House to adopt. Putting the House on record on this matter is a vital step toward ensuring a genuine and effective investigation, and ultimately, a fair trial which provides just punishment for the guilty parties.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am honored to join with my colleagues in bringing the House's attention to the 26th anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, a tragedy that continues to upset the peace and stability of the eastern-Mediterranean region. The Turkish invasion, which occurred on July 20, 1974, has led to the expulsion of over 200,000 Greek Cypriots from their ancestral homelands for more than a quarter of a century.The systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing and harassment of Greek Cypriots has significantly marred the rich history of Cyprus and its people. Lootings and destruction continued to be ordered against archaeological and religious monuments in an attempt to wipe out the Hellenic and Christian Orthodox heritage of the island. The policies of redistributing Greek Cypriots' land to the 80,000 transferred Turkish settlers brought from the mainland by the Turkish government, and of harassing those Greek Cypriot enclaves forced to live within the stifling confines to Turkish-controlled areas on the island, are offensive to our nation's values. These violations of international law, unless acknowledged and remedied, will continue to cast a grim shadow on the future of all Cypriots.We, here in the House of Representatives, must remember the thousands of innocent Greek Cypriot victims not just for the meaning of their suffering, but also as a reminder of all those who have fallen victim to vicious ethnic, religious, and social hatred. Even today, ethnic strife remains a pox on the international community, and the unrelenting pattern of conflict around the world illustrates the importance of commemorative anniversaries such as the one we acknowledge today. Perhaps, it is only when we focus on the similaries of suffering between the people of the world that we can move beyond the differences among us. Our nation's unshakable commitment to human rights and the dignity of all people demands that we acknowledge and remember all those who have suffered at the hands of bigotry, hatred and intolerance around the world.As a nation, we witnessed a myriad of atrocities in the last century. In response, rightly, we have committed our nation to both working for the peaceful resolution of ethnic conflicts around the world and to defending truth and memory where injustice has occurred. Today, I am proud that this House again ensures that the victims of aggression on Cyprus are not victimized in memory as they were in life.Mr. Speaker, I am here today for a simple reason: to publicly recall that since 1974, thousands of innocent Greek Cypriots, regardless of sex or age, have been victimized by ethnic cleansing and partition for no just cause. Failure to take note of the situation in Cyprus is to become a party to this gross injustice, for as we all know, silence and inactivity amounts to acceptance.I continue to advocate the unwavering support of this House in support of the people of Cyprus in their struggle for a peaceful and just settlement to this protracted and ugly conflict with Turkey.Mr. Speaker, I'd like to commend and thank my colleagues Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney and Congressman Michael Bilirakis, the co-chairs of the Congressional Hellenic Caucus. Thanks to their leadership, this House has again fulfilled America's commitment to memory and decency, and most importantly, has kept faith with the people of Cyprus. I'd also like to recognize and express my thanks for the tireless devotion of America's citizens of Hellenic descent. Thanks to them and their commitment, the atrocities which have occurred in Cyprus will not be forgotten. We must build on their successes and work together to find an end to this terrible injustice as soon as possible.",

    "title": "RECOGNITION OF THE QUEENS COURIER",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I pay tribute to the Queens Courier, a weekly community newspaper in the borough Queens, New York, which is celebrating its 15th anniversary.The Queens Courier was launched late in the last century by Victoria Schneps and John Toscano. Victoria was a school teacher who teamed-up with then WABC-TV reporter Geraldo Rivera to expose abhorrent conditions at the Willowbrook State School for the Mentally Retarded. Victoria's daughter Lara had resided at the facility. John meanwhile, a former political editor at the New York Daily News published the weekly newspaper Queens Week. The two entrepreneurs invested a mere $250 each to embark on their journalistic quest where in the beginning they worked out of Victoria's living room and did not take salaries for the first year.The first issue of the newspaper hit the streets on May 9, 1985 as the Whitestone/College Point Courier. The front page headline read ``Whitestone-College Point Courier: First Issue Today.'' That first edition included stories on traffic tie-ups on the Throgs Neck Bridge, local school news and political and gardening columns. Within the next few years, Victoria bought John out and the newspaper attracted many loyal readers and established a strong identity in the area. Then as readership increased, Victoria Schneps expanded the newspaper to cover most communities throughout Queens and subsequently renamed the paper to the Queens Courier.Today the borough-wide publication includes five newspapers serving 36 neighborhoods in Queens. The newspaper features quality writing and reporting in a contemporary and easy to read format. It is available both by paid subscription and can be obtained at hundreds of outlets throughout Queens.The Queens Courier has also won numerous awards for excellence in community journalism while affording local businesses and merchants, the opportunities to reach their customers in an efficient and cost-effective manner. In addition, the publication has ventured into the broadcasting and Internet domain with the weekly public affairs show ``Queens on the Air'' on local cable and an informative site on the world wide web at &lt;a href=\"http://www.queenscourier.com\"&gt;www.queenscourier.com&lt;/a&gt;. I encourage everybody to log onto this site to see what community journalism is all about.Yes, from humble beginnings--including that stint until 4 a.m. to get the very first edition out--to obtaining the respect and trust of thousands of Queens citizens, the Queens Courier has become a newspaper heavyweight in the new millennium. Yet the publication continues to stay on the original mission that it set 15 years ago--to provide local news coverage in a fair, accurate and balanced manner. Whether through the breadth of its stories, the quality of its editorials, the informative advertisements, special features and insightful columns--the Queens Courier remains on the cutting edge of community journalism.Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me now in congratulating Victoria Schneps and the entire staff of the Queens Courier for a terrific 15 years of service to the Queens community. I am confident that the Queens Courier will continue to enjoy success for many more years to come.",

The time is approaching for both sides to work out their differences and find a way to co-exist without antagonism.

They are people in Europe, some of them in Poland, especially who my mother would refer to as her aunt so-and-so or her cousin so-and-so, people that she never saw again when she left Poland as a 6-year-old girl.People who just disappeared and nobody knew what happened to them, but everybody knew, in reality, what happened to them. They had been rounded up, little kids, their parents, husbands and wives, separated in extermination camps, put into gas chambers and just changed into smoke.The entire world, Mr. Speaker, stood by for so long during that period of time. People did not want to know. It was a catastrophe of just enormous proportions that at the end, there were over 12 million people that were exterminated, 6 million of them Jews, Catholics, labor union workers, gypsies and others. Horrible experiments done on human beings just for the sadistic curiosity of so many physicians gone mad in Nazi Germany.The world turned a blind eye. Oh, they had excuses. They did not know. They did not hear about it. When we think about it, Mr. Speaker, people disappearing in the middle of the night, half of towns just disappearing and others thinking, thinking that they better not speak up, lest something happen to them.We must recognize this tragedy of all tragedies, Mr. Speaker. The action in the House today to make the Rotunda available for a commemoration of this terribly horrific event is something that we do with a great deal of sadness, but with the knowledge of knowing that if we did not take this kind of action to keep reminding the world that, indeed, these things do happen, that they can happen, and that there are good people who must and need to speak up, then we could never prevent this from happening again.Mr. Speaker, I commend all of our colleagues who have spoken here today and all who have expressed their support for this resolution, and I thank the sponsors of the resolution for bringing it before us today.",

The full extent of the damage is as yet unknown, but the numbers of dead are at least in the tens of thousands, the number of injured in the hundreds of thousands, and the number of displaced is so far over a half a million.The estimate of property damage now tops $5 billion, but mere numbers cannot capture the extent of the devastation, nor the horror at the loss of life and loved ones.Mr. Speaker, I want to express my personal condolences to all of those in India for the tragic losses that they have suffered.I also want to express my condolences to those Indian-Americans whose families or friends have been affected by the earthquake. I know that the Indian-American community has mobilized since the earthquake to provide donations to those organizations that are assisting the relief operations on the ground in India, and the community should be commended for and assisted in its efforts.The U.S. Agency for International Development has responded with a pledge of $5 million in emergency assistance joining many other nations as the international community comes together to assist in the search and rescue effort.I am sure that, in this hour of India's deepest need, the United States and the international community will continue to do all that they can to assist India in the rescue and reconstruction efforts.Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us today expresses the deepest sympathies of the Congress to the people of India and expresses our support as the people of India begin to rebuild their lives.

Mr. Sharon's election in a time of crisis speaks volumes about him and the State of Israel. I would add that this resolution says something important about the United States that many countries in the Middle East need to know: Whoever the Prime Minister of Israel may be, that person and the government of Israel will enjoy the friendship and full support of this House and the American people.Mr. Speaker, I have great confidence in Ariel Sharon, a man who I believe can bring both peace and security to the people of Israel. The people of Israel--the only genuine democracy in the Middle East--have spoken and the results of their election must be respected. Anyone who believes Prime Minister-elect Sharon's election can be used to heighten tension, or to drive a wedge between the United States and Israel, is badly mistaken.The bond between the United States and Israel, our longstanding friend and ally, is absolutely unshakable. Whether the prime minister is Ehud Barak or Ariel Sharon, Shimon Peres, or Benjamin Netanyahu, it is absolutely critical that all nations know that Israel will have the full support of the United States of America.Mr. Speaker, Ariel Sharon's election sends a powerful message that we would be well-advised to heed: Yasir Arafat can't be a negotiator for the ``peace of the brave'' by day and a coordinator of cowardly terrorist acts by night. The people of Israel will not tolerate terrorism as a tool of diplomacy, or as an acceptable response when Palestinians believe that Israel's diplomatic offers are inadequate.It seems to me that in giving this mandate to Ariel Sharon, the people of Israel are saying, in a very clear way, that peace initiatives will be met with peaceful responses, and that acts of violence will be met with appropriate responses, rather than further concessions.Mr. Speaker, the Palestinians should be cautioned not to misread Sharon's hardline reputation to mean he is intransigent. This prime minister-elect represents a real opportunity. The Palestinians would be well advised not to try to wait out Sharon's government until the next election; they may lose more than they gain.As an original cosponsor of the resolution, I want to commend and thank Mr. Hyde and Mr. Lantos, the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member on the House International Relations Committee, for their dedication and effort in getting this bill before the House today.",

This support reflects the results of the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review conducted by the Clinton Administration which declared its intention to support Taiwan's participation in international organizations and to make every effort to make sure that this important goal is accomplished.Second, this legislation will move Taiwan toward membership in the WHO. Such membership could benefit Taiwan tremendously. For example, in 1998, the WHO was unable to assist Taiwan with an outbreak of a virus that killed 70 children and infected 1,100 more. WHO membership could have prevented needless deaths and sickness.Third, the WHO could benefit enormously from Taiwan's more active participation in the WHO. Taiwan has made tremendous achievements in the field of health, and the WHO should have full access to Taiwan's technical and financial assistance.Mr. Speaker, the bill requires the State Department to initiate a plan to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan at the annual summit of the World Health Assembly, next month in Geneva. I believe that this is an appropriate step for the United States to take in support Taiwan's participation in international organizations.I urge my colleagues to support the bill.",

    "title": "COMMEMORATING ARMENIAN GENOCIDE",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am honored to take part in an important annual event in the House of Representatives, the commemoration of the Armenian Genocide. I am proud that dozens of Members gather each year to mark this dark chapter in human history. Such devotion to memory is not a trivial matter. We know this to be true because, even today, there are those who would vainly try to deny the past, in order to influence the future.We, as a moral people, cannot allow such wicked efforts to prosper. Even passive acceptance of such lies would be tantamount to participating in a second genocide. As we all know, surely and irrefutably, the first Armenian Genocide, occurred between 1915 and 1923, and resulted in the deliberate death of 1.5 million human souls, killed for the crime of their own existence. The second Armenian Genocide, which every year we must struggle against, is the ongoing effort by some to deny reality, to deny history, to deny one of humanity's darkest hours.Mr. Speaker, the Armenian Genocide marked a critical point in history. We can look back now, with the wisdom of hindsight, and see in the deaths of a million and a half Armenians the first signs of the breathtaking cruelty of the last century. We can see technology and hatred converging toward the creation of a new phenomenon in human history, the apotheosis of evil, the creation of genocide, the organized attempt to annihilate an entire people.The Ottoman Empire's campaign to eliminate the entire Armenian population existing within its borders was no accident, no mistake made by a bureaucrat. Genocide was official policy and 1.5 million Armenians died as a result. They were starved and shot, deported and humiliated. They were old and young, innocent and blameless. They were killed, not for what they had one, but for who they were.Mr. Speaker, when we assemble here, in the House of Representatives, and remember the Armenian Genocide, we stand as witnesses to humanity's worst potential and promise to do better. To not stand by, impassive and confused in the face of horror. We commit ourselves to our common humanity and the precious rights enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. Genocide is incomprehensible, but not unstoppable.For genocide to be removed from our world and banished forever, we must begin with teaching our children what has happened, and recalling, publicly and clearly, the unprecedented slaughter of the innocent in the 20th century; first in Armenian and then throughout Europe. As a just and honorable nation, we must do more than shrug our shoulders at atrocities. We must bear witness, year after year, and in doing so, commit ourselves to preventing history's repetition.Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I are here today for one simple reason: to remind our nation that eighty-five years ago one-third of the Armenian people, 1.5 million men, women and children, were put to death for the crime of their own birth. To deny this reality is to deny that genocide can happen again.I want to thank America's citizens of Armenian descent for their unfailing commitment to their people's history and their unwavering struggle to ensure that the memory and history of their peoples' darkest hour is never lost. Thanks to them, the Armenian Genocide and its lessons will not be forgotten in our time and in our nation.Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn't thank and commend my colleagues, Congressmen Joe Knollenberg and Frank Pallone, the co-Chairmen of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues. Thanks to their leadership, this House will again honorably fulfill America's commitment to memory and justice.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring the Bayside Jewish Center on the occasion of its 75th Anniversary.It was in late 1926 that a small number of Jewish residents in the Bayside West community of Queens, NY, began to meet in a store on 32nd Avenue near 201st Street, made available by Isaac Muss, father of past Honorary President Charles J. Muss. Around the same time, a group of Jewish residents in the central Bayside area rented a loft and began to meet on the third floor above some stores on Bell Boulevard.During the next seven years, the activities and participation grew steadily. In 1934, Rabbi Ariol Hyams became the spiritual leader of the Bayside West Jewish Center. Because interest had increased substantially, the space available to the members was no longer sufficient. Thus, they joined together with the group at the Center on Bell Boulevard to found and incorporate the Bayside Jewish Center. This was 1935.It was not until 1960, after many trials and tribulations in respect to finding a permanent place for the center, when the traditional and formal dedication of the new Bayside Jewish Center building was held. Immediately following the dedication of the facility, the Bayside Jewish Center became the main center of community service, a veritable beehive of activity.Many great personalities have attended meetings and functions at the Center including President Jimmy Carter, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, Senator Jacob Javitz, Senator Wayne Morse, Mayor John Lindsay, Mayor Robert Wagner, numerous Members of the House of Representatives, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, Cantor Moshe Kousavitsky and President Norman Lamm of Yeshiva University.The Center supported many well known causes such as the United Jewish Appeal, Bonds for Israel, Yeshiva University, and other worthy institutions. The Center was the founder of several local organizations as well, such as the Clergy Club of Bayside and the Council of Churches and Synagogues.One of the great accomplishments of the Bayside Jewish Center was the founding of the Etz Chayim Youth Organization. This organization has brought together over two hundred teenagers to hold their Sabbath Services in the Junior Ballroom of the Center, followed by lunches on each Sabbath or holiday. Etz Chayim can also take credit for weekend Shabbatons, sponsored by Yeshiva University on an annual basis and attended by over three hundred young people from many communities throughout the United States, which have become well-established events. To this day, hundreds of its members are active leaders of many synagogues and Jewish organizations throughout the world.Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring the 75th Anniversary of the Bayside Jewish Center and all of the people whose lives it has touched.",

Chet also serves as Political Activities Chair of the Polish American Congress, which represents the more than one million Americans of Polish descent in the New York Metropolitan area. He has met with many Polish leaders, including Lech Walesa, and has worked to organize the Polish community in New York politics. He recently testified at the Holocaust Restitution Committee and helped to organize several Holocaust programs. Due to his activism among Americans of diverse backgrounds, members of the Southeast Asian Community have nicknamed Chet the ``Queens Political Ambassador.'' He has been awarded citations from various immigrant communities and has received local acclaim as a champion of immigrants and new Americans.Cantor Doreen Gamell studied music and philosophy for years before finding her true calling. When Cantor Jacob Taron asked her to substitute for him at a Friday night service in Port Washington, she found the perfect home for her voice, mind, and heart. Several years of study and several student pulpits later, Doreen Gamell became the Cantor at Temple Shalom in Floral Park. In addition to her duties at the synagogue, Cantor Gamell has been recognized for her work instructing developmentally challenged adults in the study of the Jewish texts and music, and in ritual and Torah cantillations.Frank Biordi, President of Biordi Construction Company, has long been involved in community and business affairs in Queens, and has been a strong supporter of various local and national civic organizations. Frank has been a generous benefactor of the SIDS Foundation, Cancer Care Society, Deepdale Gardens Boulevard Bank Drive, Bayside Little League, and New Hyde Park Little League.Joanna Laba is the Executive Director of Savoy at Little Neck, a world-class assisted living facility which opened in the fall of 2000. Her responsibilities include: developing and maintaining operational systems, maintaining a maximum census, developing initiatives consistent with resident-care needs, maintaining the memory support program, and supervising admission criteria practices. Joanna has also developed and managed support groups for seniors and their caregivers, including those concerning Alzheimer's and other memory-impairing diseases.Mohammed Saleh was born and raised in Bangladesh, and received his Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy from the University of Dhaka. Mr. Saleh has served his community in several capacities: as President of the Long Island Muslim Society, Former President of the Empire State Pharmaceutical Society, and Founding President of the Bangladesh-American Pharmacists Association. He currently owns three pharmacies in the New York Metropolitan Area and is an active member of the Pharmacists Society of the State of New York and the National Community Pharmacists Association.Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in honoring these exceptional Americans as they are honored by The Eastern Queens Democratic Club, for their outstanding service and tireless dedication to the community.",

    "title": "HONORING LILLIAN TICK ON HER 100TH BIRTHDAY",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring Lillian Tick on the occasion of her 100th Birthday.Lillian Tick was born Lillian Ostrega, the oldest of five children to Isadore (Ichimayer) and Frieda (Frima) Ostrega, in the city of Wyshkov, Poland on the third day of July 1901.Mr. Speaker, Isadore Ostrega left Poland for the United States in 1908 to search for a better life for himself and his family. In 1912, after years of hard work, he was able to bring his wife, Frieda, to join him. When Frieda left Europe, it was Lillian who obtained and supplied food for her family. It took eight years before Lillian's parents were finally able to save enough money to bring their children to America. Lillian, her three brothers--Louis, David and Hyman--and her sister, Dora, all arrived at Ellis Island in 1920.Lillian eventually met and married Morris Tick, a lansman emigre from Poland. They had three children: Irving, who passed away in 1988, Theodore (Ted) and Natalie.Mr. Speaker, Lillian Tick is affectionately called Mama Lilly by all who know her and cherish her. Mama Lily's many friends and admirers include Rabbi Dr. H. Joseph Simckes, and Cantor Sol Zim and the other congregants and employees of the Hollis Hills Jewish Center, where she is nearly a permanent fixture.Mama Lily is a four-foot-nine-inch bundle of energy. To this day, she still cleans and dusts to the level of her own height, maintains her own room, and insists on doing the dishes each evening, as well as the family ironing, despite having fractured both hips and walking with the aid of a quadruped cane.Mama Lilly reads the newspapers everyday, and attends Shabbat and High Holiday services regularly. When she is able, she observes the various Yahrtzeit memorials in honor of her dear departed.Mr. Speaker, if you ask Mama Lilly how she feels, the response is invariably, ``I'm fine.'' When you meet Lillian Tick for the first time, you find a universal mother and grandmother. From then on you will always address her as, and you will always have, a ``Mama Lilly.''The Hollis Hills Jewish Center is celebrating Lillian's 100th Birthday on June 23, 2001, so that all of Mama's many friends can share in this joyful occasion. She is beloved by all; her search for a new and better life in America, her independent spirit, and her life of hard work is the essence of our great nation: a land of immigrants yearning to breathe free.Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to rise and join me now in honoring the 100th Birthday of Lillian Tick, who has touched the lives of so many people during her glorious years with us.",

    "title": "CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AUTHORIZING CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT PHYSICAL DESECRATION OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, the Founding Fathers must be very puzzled looking down on us today. Instead of seeing us dealing with the very real challenges that face our Nation, they see us laboring again under this compulsion to amend the document that underpins our democracy. They see a house of dwarfs trying to give this government a great new power at the expense of the people and, for the first time, to stifle dissenters and the way in which they dissent.The threat must be great, they must be saying, to justify changing the Bill of Rights for the first time and decreasing rather than increasing the rights of the people. They see our beloved Bill of Rights being eroded into the Bill of Rights and Restrictions.What is the threat? What is the threat, Mr. Speaker? I ask again, what is the threat? Is our democracy at risk? What is the crisis to the Republic? What is the challenge to our way of life? Where is our belief system being threatened? Are people jumping from behind parked cars, waving burning flags at us, trying to prevent us from getting to work and causing America to grind to a halt?Mr. Speaker, do we really believe that we are under such a siege because of a few lose cannons? Do we need to change our Constitution to save our democracy, or are we simply offended?The real threat to our society is not the occasional burning of a flag, but the permanent banning of the burners. The real threat is that some of us have now mistaken the flag for a religious icon to be worshipped as pagans would, rather than to be kept as the beloved symbol of our freedom that is to be cherished.These rare but vile acts of desecration that have been cited by those who would propose changing our founding document do not threaten anybody. If a jerk burns a flag, America is not threatened. If a jerk burns a flag, democracy is not under siege. If a jerk burns a flag, freedom is not at risk and we are not threatened. My colleagues, we are offended; and to change our Constitution because someone offends us is in itself unconscionable.Mr. Speaker, the courts have said that the flag stands for the right to burn the flag. The Nazis and the Fascists and the Imperial Japanese Army combined could not diminish the constitutional right of even one single American. Yet, in an act of cowardice, we are about to do what they could not.Mr. Speaker, where are the patriots? Where are the patriots? Whatever happened to fighting to the death for the rights of someone with whom we disagree? We now choose, instead, to react by taking away the right to protest. Even a despicable low-life malcontent has a right to disagree, and he has the right to disagree in an obnoxious fashion if he wishes. That is the true test of free expression, and we are about to fail that test.Real patriots choose freedom over symbolism. That is the ultimate contest between substance and form. Why does the flag need protecting? Is it an endangered species? Burning one flag or burning 1,000 flags does not endanger it. It is but a symbol. But change just one word of the Constitution of this great Nation, and it and we will never be the same.We cannot destroy a symbol. Yes, people have burnt the flag, but, Mr. Speaker, it still exists. There it is, hanging right in back of us. It represents our beliefs.Poets and patriots will tell us men have died for the flag, but that language itself is symbolic language. People do not die for symbols. They fight and they die for freedom. They fight and they die for democracy. They fight and they die for values. To fight and die for the flag is to fight and die for the cause in which we believe. Today some would have us change all of that.We love and we honor and respect our flag for that which it represents. It is different from all other flags. I notice in the amendment that we do not make it illegal to burn someone else's flag in someone else's country, and that is because our flag is different.No, not because of the colors or the shape or the design. They mostly have stars and some have stripes and scores and dozens are red, white, and blue.Our flag is unique because it represents our unique values. It represents tolerance for dissent. This country was founded by dissenters that others found obnoxious.What is a dissenter? In this case it is a social protester who feels so strongly about an issue that he would stoop so low as to try to get under our skin, to try to rile us up to prove his point, and to have us react by making this great Nation less than it was.How do we react? Dictators and dictatorships make political prisoners of those who burn their Nation's flags, not democracies. We tolerate dissent and dissenters, even the despicable dissenters.What is the flag, Mr. Speaker? The American flag? Yes, it is a piece of cloth. It is red, it is white and blue. It has 50 stars and 13 stripes. But if we pass this amendment and desecrators decide to start a cottage industry and make flags with 55 stars and burn them, will we rush to the floor to amend the Constitution again?If they add a stripe or two and set it ablaze, surely it would look like our flag, but is it? Do we rush in and count the stripes before we determine whether or not we are constitutionally offended? What if the stripes are orange instead of red? How do we interpret that? What mischief do we do here? If it is a full color, full-sized picture of a flag that they burn, is it a crime to desecrate a symbol of a symbol? What are we doing?Our beloved flag represents this great Nation, Mr. Speaker. We love our flag because there is a republic for which it stands, made great by a Constitution that we have sworn to protect, a Constitution given to our care by giants and about to be nibbled to death by dwarfs.Mr. Speaker, I call upon the patriots of the House to rise and to defend the Constitution, to resist the temptation to drape ourselves in the flag and to hold sacred the Bill of Rights. Defend our Constitution. I urge the defeat of this ill-conceived amendment.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, in 1996 Taiwan held the first ever direct election for president and four years later, in the presidential election of 2000, opposition party candidate Chen Shui-bian won the presidential election. Miraculously, Taiwan had a peaceful transfer of power, and for the first time in fifty years, an opposition party replaced the ruling party. Today, Taiwan's democracy is in full bloom. Every political office is contested through free and fair elections, thus dispelling the myth that democracy and Asians don't mix.Taiwan's rapid evolution into a full fledged democracy with a capitalist free-market economy clearly signals that Taiwan is ready to play a larger role on the international stage. Already, Taiwan is a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and participates actively in the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Inter-American Development Bank.Congress has repeatedly recognized Taiwan's desire to broaden its participation in the international arena by adopting legislation supporting Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization. The aftermath of the 1999 earthquake is a perfect example of why Taiwan should be allowed to participate. Unlike other disasters around the world, the United Nations delayed providing assistance to Taiwan until they got permission from China. If Taiwan had been a participant in the WHO, or better still, a member of the United Nations, no such delays would have occurred. Instead, thousands of Taiwanese suffered needlessly until the international community finally responded.After one year in office, President Chen Shui-bian has a solid record of achievement for his nation. Taiwan continues to seek resumption of dialogue with the Chinese mainland regarding eventual reunification. In addition, Taiwan has maintained a strong relationship with the United States and other friendly nations. Taiwan stands tall among nations and over the years has played a significant role in helping other nations develop. Taiwan has sent over 10,000 experts to train technicians in developing countries and has provided aid to many countries in need. It has given much to the world and the world community is enriched as a result.Unfortunately, despite Taiwan's desire to be a helpful global partner, Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations. It is time for the United Nations, on the principles of universality enshrined in the United Nations Charter, to acknowledge Taiwan's accomplishments and allow Taiwan to be a Member State.Mr. Speaker, Taiwan belongs in the United Nations. I personally support Taiwan's bid to return to the United Nations and I urge other members to do so as well.",

And the interesting thing is, when we have resolutions of this nature from time to time, we name those for whom we mourn. We regret that we cannot even supply you with that massive list as yet. There are so many of our constituents, our friends, our neighbors, our relatives, who do not yet know that they are among the mourners. This has not fully set in to our city and to our State. And yet we mourn. And let me assure you that while we mourn, we are not broken. The forces of evil have destroyed our skyline, but they have not destroyed our resolve. They have killed our people, but they have not killed our will.We come here as well to say thank you, to say thank you to each and every one of our colleagues in the House from all over America who have been so supportive to us and to the people that we represent.We express our special condolences, and ask you to do the same, to our colleague Joe Crowley who is not with us today because his cousin, a brave firefighter, is believed to have perished. Two hundred of our firefighters, over 200, only of our firefighters, are dead. Over 50 of our policemen, representing a great city, a diverse city, made up of so many people, rushing into this burning inferno, tumbling down, knowing that 200 colleagues have already died and yet continuing to go in to try to save their fellow citizens, paying no heed to their own safety.New Yorkers are tough. We are very tough. We are going to get over this. Yesterday was a day that we practiced our democracy in our State of New York. It was a primary day. We were in the middle of an election when this happened. That election has since been set aside. I was in one part of my district outside of the city of New York where there was a race going on for county executive, millions of dollars were being spent, the fight has raged for months and months with both sides at each other. And when the election was suspended, the campaign teams of both sides were seen on line together, side by side, at the blood bank.We bleed together as Americans. We cannot give you the names. The names would fill a book. We cannot give you the number, but the number is in the thousands; the mourners in the tens of thousands. But I can tell you that each and every one of them is a martyr, unknowingly; people who went to work, people who got on a plane, people who lost their lives doing things that average Americans do.We will not rest, not one of us, Democrats or Republicans, until the evil people who perpetrated this deed are found.

The towering pyramid of wreckage upon whose perimeter in New York City I have just walked hours ago is a monument, staggering in its dimensions and horrifying in its implications.In that massive tomb, Mr. Speaker, lie the remains of a still-unknown number of my fellow New Yorkers and our fellow Americans. The terrorists who murdered these people conceive of themselves as the hand of God and have executed their wicked judgment against our people. And what were our countrymen's crimes? Their crime was to go to work in a free Nation. Their crime was to get on an airplane. Their crime was to visit one of the greatest cities in the world. And, in many cases, Mr. Speaker, their crime was to attempt to save the lives of other human beings.Mr. Speaker, the kind of havoc, murder and carnage which the terrorists have inflicted upon our Nation can only be compared to war. And war, Mr. Speaker, is what we will give them back. We know which neighborhoods these people live in. We know who their landlords are. We will find out where they get their paychecks. We will hunt them down, not only the most obvious of their public leaders, but also the most hidden of their private supporters.Tonight, Mr. Speaker, evil again is on the march, and we must respond. And respond we will.

    "title": "AUTHORIZING PRESIDENT TO EXERCISE WAIVERS OF FOREIGN ASSISTANCE RESTRICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO PAKISTAN",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1465 but do so with some serious reservations. While I think we all agree that the President needs a significant amount of flexibility in order to effectively prosecute the war on terrorism, I believe we should be careful about the types of assistance that could flow to Pakistan under this particular proposal.Clearly, everyone supports the provision of economic assistance to Pakistan. Among the poorest nations in the world, Pakistan was, until a recent rescheduling, in default on U.S. loans and continues to need assistance with its massive foreign debt. In addition, the Pakistani economy remains weak although General Musharaff should be given credit for adhering to the structural adjustment plan required by the International Monetary Fund. Pakistan should also be given assistance to provide health care and education. Life expectancy is low, infant mortality is high, and too many of Pakistan's children are educated in Madrassas that provide only lessons in hatred.The problem with this bill is that it opens the door to a significant new arms relationship with Pakistan and before the United States even considers going down that road, we must consider who the arms are likely to be used against. It is clear from looking at Pakistan's immediate neighbors that the threats to Pakistan are low. In Afghanistan, the expectations for a post-Taliban government are that it would not be a threat to Pakistan. Since China is Pakistan's long-time partner on nuclear and missile-related technologies, it is unlikely Pakistan would use the weapons there. There are tensions between Iran and Pakistan but they don't seem to rise to the level of armed conflict. That leaves India, which is where any weapons we provide are likely to be used. We should think long and hard before we agree to supply Pakistan with any weapons or spare parts that would be used against India. India strongly supports the U.S.-led coalition against terrorism and does so without preconditions or reservations. Now is not the time for the U.S. to abandon its democratic friends in South Asia, or elsewhere.One final point, Madam Speaker, we should remember that among the sanctions we are waiving here today are those imposed because of the October 1999 coup in Pakistan. The message from this waiver must not be that democracy is no longer important. In fact, the one lesson we should draw from the current situation is that democracy remains the solution to extremism everywhere. We must continue to urge Pakistan to return to democracy as soon as possible.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am outraged by the statement of one of the previous speakers who has now left the floor who said, with his unique sense of justice, that we should treat everybody equally; that we should treat the terrorists and victims the same; that we should treat Hamas the same way and look at them in the same way that we treat little girls going to a disco, or grandmothers taking their grandchildren out for pizza for lunch. That is not justice; that is ridiculous.Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution. I would like to thank the chairman, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), and the ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), for their outstanding efforts in crafting this resolution and getting it to the floor in so timely a fashion.I believe it is critically important at this moment, this moment of truth, for the House of Representatives to speak out against the Palestinian terrorism which has cost so many innocent Israelis their lives.It is well past time for Congress to say enough, enough killing, enough terror, and finally, enough duplicity, excuses, and lies. Palestinian terrorism is not an accident; it is not an uncontrollable cycle. In fact, it is the result of a deliberate, deliberate refusal by the Palestinian Authority to crack down on terrorist groups like Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic jihad.It is the result of the Palestinian Authority's revolving-door prison policy, and the Palestinian leadership's unconscionable refusal to arrest terrorists whose names and addresses are made familiar by endless Israeli requests for action, requests that have been confirmed by our own government.Hamas is a terrorist group, and the PA harbors them. Our President says there is no difference, that the Palestinian Authority must be held accountable for these grotesque decisions which make any hope of peace an impossibility.The Palestinian people have legitimate grievances and they have a right to express them; but they have no right, no right, no right to blow up and murder innocent men, women, and children.Mr. Speaker, the United States cannot work during the day with Palestinian leaders on ``the peace of the brave'' while in the evening they turn a blind eye to terrorist bombings, shootings, and mayhem. As President Bush made so clear in his address to this Congress and to the American people, the time has come for every Nation and national group to choose: they are either with us or they are with the terrorists.The Palestinian Authority has exactly that choice to make now. Either they destroy the infrastructure of Hamas, Islamic jihad, and other terrorist groups, or they will lose their relationships with the Congress, lose their relationship with the United States, and in the end, stand to lose much more than that.Mr. Speaker, we must pass this excellent resolution. Again, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman Hyde) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) for helping the House to find its voice on this very critical issue.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution commending and welcoming General Musharraf of Pakistan. It is fitting that we should commend him for his support of the U.S.-led war on terrorism. Mr. Musharraf has accommodated our requests for bases, allowed us to use Pakistani airspace and otherwise provided us with logistic and intelligence-related support for our operations in Afghanistan. For that we are truly grateful.Rhetorically, Mr. Musharraf has aligned Pakistan with the nations opposed to terrorism, he abandoned his support of the Taliban in Afghanistan and recently met with Hamid Karzai the interim leader of Afghanistan offering his support for the new regime. In his speech of January 12, Mr. Musharraf pointed Pakistan away from Islamic extremism and back toward the goal of the founders of Pakistan: a secular, moderate, democratic, Muslim state. but there is a long way to go before Pakistan reaches that goal.For too long, terrorist groups that operate across the line of control in India have been given safe haven in Pakistan. The authors of the attack on the Indian parliament last December and on the state assembly building in Srinigar last October found aid and support in Pakistan. White a series of high-profile arrests and the announcement of a formal ban on militant groups operating in Pakistani are good beginnings, the jury is still out on whether infiltrations across the line of control have stopped.The steps taken to date are helpful but some recent backsliding is also in evidence. Last week, Mr. Musharraf claimed that the Indian intelligence services where behind the kidnaping of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. Such allegations are baseless and do not help either find Mr. Pearl or lower the level of tension between India and Pakistan.Beyond this, Mr. Musharraf has returned to the formulation that the terrorist groups in Pakistan are ``freedom fighters''. This is not acceptable. Pakistan can no longer say it is simply giving ``political'' support to Kashmiri groups while secretly aiding their infiltration into India. The point of U.S. policy since September 11 has been to oppose all terrorists, not just those who are conveniently or easily opposed. Mr. Musharraf must choose, he is either with the terrorists or he is with us, he cannot have both.On the subject of democracy, Mr. Musharraf has also said the right things. He has laid out a timetable for Pakistan's return to democracy and has held village level elections. Provincial and national assembly elections are scheduled. But we must not forget that Mr. Musharraf is the reason that Pakistan is again off the democratic path. For him to receive full credit for restoring democracy elections at all levels must be held, including elections for his office. All of this is admittedly difficult to accomplish against the backdrop of Islamic extremism, but it is Mr. Musharraf's own timetable and he should be urged to keep it.Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate for us to welcome Mr. Musharraf and thank him for his support, but we should also be mindful of how much further Pakistan has to go.",

During the past nine decades, thousands of members from throughout the United States have set forth to promote a prosperous and peaceful Israel, ensure Jewish continuity, pursue social justice, and provide for the health, education, and well-being of American Jewish women and their families.Since the group's humble beginning as a women's study circle, dedicated members have helped Hadassah to become one of the world's leading humanitarian organizations. In Israel, Hadassah's flagship project, the Hadassah Medical Organization, is the most advanced medical center in the region. This state-of-the-art healthcare facility is comprised of two hospitals, 90 outpatient clinics, numerous community health centers, and annually services over 600,000 patients regardless of race, religion, or creed.The compassion of Hadassah is not only illustrated by their healthcare efforts. Hadassah funds and maintains four major Israeli and American programs--Young Judaea, Young Allya, Hadassah Israel Education Services and the Jewish National Fund. Each of these programs strives to support and promote Jewish life for Israelis and Americans of all ages. In addition to these programs, Hadassah is engaged in a wealth of educational, advocacy, training, and community service initiatives both in the U.S. and in Israel.In honor of more than 300,000 members of Hadassah, I am privileged to pay tribute to their selflessness, incalculable hospitality, and success. Mr. Speaker, I would ask that you and my colleagues of the U.S. House of Representatives join me in congratulating Hadassah and its dedicated members for nine decades of social action and noble work.",

    "title": "CHRISTOPHER BLAHA--HERO AVENGER",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank and praise Army Lieutenant Christopher Blaha for his heroic actions in the defense of our nation. I would like to share with my fellow colleagues the following two articles describing Lieutenant Blaha's incredible service in our fight against terrorism. September 11, 2001 was a horrific day for the United States, yet brave men, such as Lieutenant Blaha, show us all that the spirit of America has not, and will not, be broken. Mr. Speaker, we will prevail.On every grenade he threw at the al Qaeda fighters, New Yorker Christopher Blaha wrote the name of the best friend he lost to terrorists on Sept. 11. Also burned into the Army lieutenant's mind was the memory of a second buddy, who died trying to save lives at the World Trade Center. After a fierce eight-day fight in remote Afghan mountains, 24-year-old Blaha, from Great Neck, L.I., returned to safety yesterday and immediately spoke of his two lost pals, Andrew Stergiopoulos, who worked for bond firm Cantor Fitzgerald, and FDNY firefighter Jonathan Ielpi. ``There was definitely a vindictive side to it--I can go back and tell their families everything we did.'' Blaha said, as he rested at the Bagram air base near Kandahar. As his fellow soldiers cheered the returning troops, Blaha, fighting with the Army's 10th Mountain Division based in upstate New York, told how he had written Stergiopoulos' name on his grenades. Blaha's mom, Cooky said her son had formed a bond for life with Steriopoulos as the pair grew up in Great Neck, playing ice hockey for a community team, the Great Neck Bruins. John Hughes, the father of skating gold-medalist Sarah Hughes, also played on the team. ``Andrew and Chris were real close--I'm just so proud of what he's done,'' Cooky Blaha told The Post. Steriopoulos' brother, George, said from his home in Great Neck that his family was ``touched'' by Blaha's words. ``It's been very hard,'' he said. ``It would have been Andrew's 24th birthday on March 7.'' ``I saw Chris going off to boot camp, and we've been hoping that he's OK. That's really touching, what he said.'' Ielpi, a 29-year New York City firefighter with two young sons, had known the Blaha family for years, having attended St. Aloysius elementary school in Great Neck with Christopher Blaha's eldest brother, Jack. Ielpi's mom, Anne, said last night her family had been thinking of Blaha during his Afghanistan mission and was hoping he returned safely. ``We've known the family for years and we think it's great if he can get a little retaliation,'' she said. ``It means a lot to everyone.'' Blaha had told his mom before leaving for Uzbekistan in January that he would dedicate his mission to his friends. ``He's just a kid from Great Neck really, but he rang this morning and told me he had been ordering in the planes with the bombs and I couldn't believe it--he's made us all proud,'' she said.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I am honored to rise today to salute the nation of Greece and celebrate the 181st anniversary of Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire. This great day in Greek history commemorates the successful struggle of the Greek people for national sovereignty.The Ancient Greeks forged the notion of democracy, something for which the United States and the rest of the world will always be thankful. Indeed, we owe Greece the inspiration for our own democratic form of government. As Thomas Jefferson pointed out, Greece is ``the light which led ourselves out of Gothic darkness''. I think it is safe to say that the Founders of both Greece and the United States would be proud of the tremendous achievements of both nations.Throughout the past 181 years, there have been repeated challenges to the independence of Greece, yet its people have stridently fought to maintain both their democracy and their independence. The United States and its people have been proud to stand by her and provide strength, assistance and friendship to overcome those struggles. Greeks across the United States and throughout the world have much to celebrate on this great day of independence.Today, the United States shares many common threads with Greece, including commitments to democracy, peace and human rights. Greece has sent us her sons and daughters in past generations, helping us to build our proud nation. We will not forget the fierce resistance with which Greece opposed the Axis powers in World War Two, nor their equally staunch resistance to the expansion of communism in the war's immediate aftermath. Greece has been one of our strongest allies ever since. For nearly 5 decades now Greece has been a key NATO member, helping to stabilize its area of the Mediterranean. Since Greece and the United States share many interests and many values, the celebration of the 181st Anniversary of Greek Independence gives us the opportunity to call for an even closer collaboration between both our countries.Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to celebrate once again Greek culture and to toast the Greek people. It is an honor to rise and commemorate the 181st Greek Independence Day. On this day we celebrate more than just Greece's independence, we celebrate Greece as a nation and as a friend.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I reluctantly rise in opposition. After a decade of work, I had been tremendously pleased to see that my amendment to ban the marketing and movement of downed animals at auctions in stockyards was included and accepted by the House, and I am disappointed today that this commonsense legislation to protect the safety of the food supply and to end the suffering of downed animals was neutered by the conference.The transport and marketing of these incapacitated, sick, and crippled animals creates a tremendous human health concern, as well as humane concerns. This is only one-tenth of 1 percent of the market, and they are not euthanized only because at that point they could not be used for human consumption.The downed animal amendment has 165 sponsors, was accepted by both Houses. The House should know that meat from downed animals has an increased risk from bacterial contamination and other diseases, including neurological afflictions such as mad cow disease. The Veterinary Services Department of the USDA itself said that downed animals is the number two risk for mad cow disease.We have prohibited the use of this product in the school lunch program; McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's have banned the use of this, California bans the use of this. How on earth do we justify using the meat of these poor downed, crippled, sick animals in our own food supply?Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Farm Security Act Conference Report. After over a decade of work, I was tremendously pleased to see that my amendment to ban the marketing and movement of ``downed animals'' at auctions and stockyards and to require that these animals be humanely euthanized was included in both the House and the Senate version of the Farm Security Act.Today I am disappointed to report that this commonsense legislation to protect the safety our Nation's food supply, and to end the suffering of downed animals was severely neutered during conference committee negotiations.The transport and marketing of these incapacitated sick or crippled animals creates tremendous human health concerns as well as humane concerns. Downers make up only one-tenth of 1 percent of the market. And not to euthanize them just because then they couldn't be marketed for human consumption, is indeed a sin.The downed animal amendment cosponsored by 165 members, was accepted by the House and the Senate and offered a solution that would protect both the public health and downed animals.Meat from downed animals has an increased risk for bacterial contamination and other diseases, including neurological affictions such as mad cow disease. This is not a fringe idea.Last year, the USDA itself instituted a policy precluding the purchase of beef from downed animals for the national school lunch program because of these safety concerns.How on God's Earth can they justify marketing this to the rest of the country, when they say it is unsafe to put in our school lunch program?In addition to this, the fast food chains are doing the appropriate thing. Chains such as McDonald's and Burger King and Wendy's have all banned the use of meat from downed animals in their products. And who else? California, the largest cattle producer in the country, Colorado and Illinois, have already prohibited the entry of downed animals into the food supply. Why just them? All Americans must be protected from this risk.And yet, and yet, there are some who kowtow to the few irresponsible folks within the industry in order to protect only one-tenth of 1 percent of the market.Last year a Zogby America Poll of 1,000 people in our country found that four out of every five opposed the use of downed animals for human food.I want to emphasize that my downed animal amendment passed both bodies; it has 165 cosponsors; and that it gives USDA the authority it needs and does not interfere with the USDA's current disease-testing program.",

    "title": "PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today with a heavy heart, because with this resolution of solidarity the House formally acknowledges three critical policy failures:First, we are owning up to the failure of our Nation's Pygmalion-like, romanticized notion that we could transform an Arab Che Guevara into a Palestinian Nelson Mandela. In the end, Yasir Arafat could not put down the gun.Second, we are at last admitting that our policy of one more chance was understood by Yasir Arafat to mean that, no matter what, there would always be one more chance. We are declaring today that there are no more last chances.Finally, Mr. Speaker, we are acknowledging the failure of our countless efforts to squeeze from Mr. Arafat even the smallest commitment to nonviolence. After trips by the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the CIA director, and the President's special envoy, Yasir Arafat still cannot put down the gun.Today, Mr. Speaker, we are acknowledging failure. Not a failure of our making, nor one of our choosing. But this admission is the first step toward realizing our policy toward our ultimate goal of peace with security and a peace with dignity.We are declaring today that there are no more last-chances left. His credibility is gone. His promises are hollow. The Congress, at least, has had enough.Instead of sharing dreams of hope and plans of progress, as all great leaders have, he inspires young people to kill themselves to blow up babies and grandparents in pizzerias, or young girls going to a dance, or worshipers observing Passover. Nothing can justify the use of such evil depravity as a negotiating tool. He cannot put down the gun.``Get re-involved,'' Mr. Arafat and the world told us. ``Get re-involved and the violence will stop. And so we did. But he couldn't put down the gun.In February 2001, President Bush sent Secretary of State Colin Powell to the Middle East and Arafat couldn't put down the gun. The Administration endorsed the Mitchell Committee report, and sent CIA Director George Tenet to facilitate implementation of the Mitchell report, and Arafat couldn't put down the gun. At the UN, President Bush called for a Palestinian state, and in a major speech, Secretary Powell elaborated on the President's vision, and Arafat couldn't put down the gun. The President sent General Anthony Zinni as his special envoy, and the Vice-President offered to meet with Yasir Arafat, but Arafat couldn't put down the gun. The President sent Gen. Zinni again, and Arafat still couldn't put down the gun.And finally, finally, after 19 months of daily drive-by-shootings, mortar attacks, rocket attacks and suicide bombings in restaurants, cafes, discos and religious observances, the people being murdered by Arafat's bombers said enough is enough. Israel has endured what no other nation would ever be asked to accept: the daily slaughter of its citizens by the very parties with whom others expected it to negotiate.And so the IDF was sent into the hotbeds of Palestinian terrorism. And the results are quite clear. Just as our armed forces broke the back of Al-Qaida in Afghanistan, the Israeli Army has rightfully crushed the Palestinian terrorist infrastructure. Not surprisingly, there has been a real, sustained and significant reduction in Palestinian violence against Israel.As did every Member of the House, I hoped that the Oslo agreement between Israel and the Palestinians would lead to peace. I still believe that peace is possible, but it is only possible if the Palestinians will finally put away the guns and bombs and seek their statehood at the bargaining table.So yes, Mr. Speaker, we are acknowledging failure. Not a failure of our making, nor one of our choosing. But we are today recognizing a terrible truth: as it stands today, the Palestinian Authority is the author, solicitor, supporter, organizer and financier of Palestinian terrorism. In concert with Iran, it is an enemy of peace. And what about tomorrow? After all, it is the Middle East. Perhaps Mr. Arafat can be resurrected as a seeker of peace. But until then, what we have done has failed.And this admission is the first step toward realigning our policy toward our ultimate aim: a just and lasting settlement between Israel and its Arab neighbors; a peace with security and a peace with dignity. Let us hope it begins today.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to call to the attention of the House of Representatives the work of Rabbi Mordecai Waxman, one of America's great citizens, who is retiring from his position as senior rabbi at Temple Israel in Great Neck, New York. On Sunday, May 19, Temple Israel will hold a dinner to celebrate and honor Rabbi Waxman for his 55 years of devoted service not just to the Jewish community on Long Island, but to the Jewish community throughout America and around the world.Well-known throughout New York, Rabbi Waxman will be remembered in human history as one of the key figures in the effort to heal the painful breach between the Jewish people and the Roman Catholic Church. Working with two Popes, Rabbi Waxman played a key role in the Second Vatican Council's publication of the Nostra Aetate document, which transformed modem relations between Jews and Catholics.Rabbi Waxman has not only been a leader between religions, but also a key figure in the U.S. Jewish community over several decades. Beginning with his ordination at the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1941, Rabbi Waxman has continuously sought opportunities for leadership, first, as the founding rabbi at Congregation Shaare Tikva in Chicago, Illinois and then, only a year later, serving as a U.S. Army chaplain from 1943 to 1946.Following his service to our nation, Rabbi Waxman went on to lead Temple Israel, along the way becoming editor of the Journal Conservative Judaism, the president of the Rabbinical Assembly, the president of the World Council of Synagogues, the chairman of the International Jewish Committee for Interreligious Consultation, the chairman of the National Council of Synagogues and even the first rabbi to become a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Gregory the Great due to his vital role in Jewish-Catholic rapprochement.Mr. Speaker, America is not a great nation because a small corps of heroes do great deeds. America is a great nation because our charter of freedom has enabled thousands of ordinary men and women to do extraordinary things.Rabbi Mordecai Waxman is just such an ordinary doer of extraordinary things. As a citizen, as a U.S. Army chaplain, as a leader of the Jewish community in America and internationally, and as a husband to the late Dr. Ruth Waxman, the father of Hillel, Jonathan and David Waxman, and the grandfather of five wonderful grandchildren, Ariya, Amir-Kia, Lailee, Jessye and Avir, Rabbi Waxman has represented what we all know is best about our nation and our society.Mr. Speaker, I call upon the whole House to rise and join me in thanking Rabbi Mordecai Waxman for his contributions to our country and its citizens, and in wishing him a retirement of peace, contentment and good health.",

    "title": "TIME FOR REGIME CHANGE IN BURMA",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate September 18th, 2002, the 14 year anniversary of one of freedom's great tragedies. On this day in 1988, a military regime assumed power in the country of Burma during a brutal crackdown, slaughtering approximately 10,000 nonviolent demonstrators in the streets of Rangoon and throughout the nation over a period of months. Were these demonstrators committing some crime? Had they broken the law of the land? Were they planning some heinous act of treason?The answer is no on all three counts--they did not, had not, and were not.The people of Burma are guilty only of sacrificing for the same dreams that have summoned greatness in men and women alike throughout history: freedom, democracy, and human rights. As Burma's 1991 Nobel Peace Prize recipient Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has said, ``. . . even under the most crushing state machinery courage rises up again and again, for fear is not the natural state of civilized man.''September 18th, 1988 was not only a tragedy, however. It was also a day of great hope. Since 1988, the Burmese people's courage has never for one instant waned or even cooled. In 1990, despite harassment, arrest, and intimidation, the National League for Democracy was voted into power with an astounding 82% of the seats in parliament. We members of Congress, as elected officials, in particular should understand the uniqueness of this victory. I know most of my colleagues in this building would do anything for that kind of mandate. In 1991, 1996, and 1998, the people of Burma and the National League for Democracy demanded recognition of this election with demonstrations and party gatherings that resulted in widespread arrests and subsequent torture. And, in August of this year, Burmese students again took to the streets in Rangoon, calling for the release of all of Burma's political prisoners.We know from our own history that the struggle for freedom is not easy nor is it without sacrifice. The sudden rush of change might come at any time, whether through the crumbling of a wall or a crowd's deafening cry for democracy in the streets. We do know, however, that the United States of America has always stood for the principles that our nation was founded upon, and we will continue to support those that share our dreams.Burma's military regime should be put on notice that the United States will neither forget September 18th, and what it represents for the Burmese people, nor tire in our belief in freedom. Most importantly, the regime should also know that many of us in the United States Congress are growing weary of the constant stalling and delaying of a full-scale political dialogue that includes Burma's ethnic nationalities. Now is the time for change in Burma and I urge my colleagues to join me in calling for that change.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I would just like to point out to our colleagues and the American people who might be listening that we are talking about somebody who is alive and well. These kinds of speeches are usually made about somebody who has passed from the scene. But Ben Gilman is an actual living legend here in the Congress and in this great land of ours.Mr. Speaker, I have been privileged the years that I have been serving here in the Congress to have served just about my entire congressional career on the Committee on International Relations with the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman). We sit on opposite sides of the aisle, and we have done that throughout our careers; and I have to state that there is nobody that has more respect than does Ben Gilman for both sides of the aisle and within the ranks of our committee.We do not always agree on every single issue, but we have to respect Ben for the positions he takes and the things that he fights for, many of which, if not 99 percent of them, I associate myself with.I want to point out to some of the Members, especially some of the younger Members of the House, that some of the most important things that they can do here, because especially with the dimension that our world is taking today, is to travel. I have had the pleasure of going on quite a number of trips together with Mr. Gilman, both when our party was in the majority and when his party was in the majority and he was the Chairman; and we learned so much on those trips, not just about each other, which is very, very important, but about the rest of the world.Ben did not travel to those parts of the world where people think a person goes to because they are luxurious and they are vacation spots. I remember once we went to India together and we flew over there courtesy of the Air Force, and when we got there, one of the things we were going to do besides visiting people of all kinds was to meet with His Excellency, the Dalai Lama. There had been a tremendous typhoon that had come through the night before. The Air Force thought it might be dangerous and then figured out that indeed our Air Force plane could not go up to the mountain where the Dalai Lama was.Ben was able to talk to the people within the government of India. They provided us with a flying boxcar that could actually get up there and land, and we did that. It must have been close to 120 degrees in that plane without windows. Our lunch melted. And yet Ben was so determined that we meet with His Excellency, the Dalai Lama, that we made that trip, a very, very difficult trip.Ben and I have gone up mountains together. We have done that in Colombia where, in meeting to fight the scourge of drugs, something in which you have been a leader in for three decades now, recognizing that problem way before almost anybody else in this House of Representatives, it took close to 1,500 of the national police of that country to protect us when we stood overnight there against the drug lords in Cartagena.So many trips, so memorable, some with our wives when they were not as dangerous as others.Just on a personal vote, to give my colleagues the dynamics of this man's career, I have been serving in the House for 20 years. I was not born when Ben Gilman was flying those missions in World War II, in the Army Air Corps, serving with my dad. That is how long Ben has been serving this country.When I grew up as a little boy, sharing a religion and a tradition that Ben Gilman does, one that is really a very small percentage, a small minority in this country, there were very few people of my faith to look up to as role models in the business of politics, elected office in America in those days. My mom told me that there was this guy in our State in New York named Ben Gilman, who was a great American, who stood for great principles and great values; and he was somebody that we could all look up to. And, indeed, I did; and it was a blessed day that I was elected to be able to serve side by side with Ben Gilman and to fight with him for so many of the causes that all of us believe in. For that, I have to tell Ben, for that, all of us are very, very grateful; and we thank him for his great service.",

    "title": "AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE AGAINST IRAQ RESOLUTION OF 2002",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, the President continues to make his case before the Congress, before the American people, and before the United Nations to garner support and legitimacy in the case against Saddam Hussein. There is no question about any of the facts the President has cited in making the case for urgent action against the threat posed by the Iraqi current regime.Only the deliberately obtuse can doubt that Saddam Hussein is a murderous, rapacious dictator with an addiction to aggression, and a long record of gross miscalculations.Since seizing power and killing all of his domestic rivals, Saddam spent the entirety of his rule either committing acts of gross unprovoked aggression, preparing for war, conducting war, brutalizing his own countrymen, or committing crimes against humanity.Madam Speaker, if we believe there is good in the world, surely we must recognize that there is also evil. Saddam Hussein is pure evil. The litany of Iraq's bad behavior is very familiar, and there is no real question about Iraq's appetite for weapons of mass destruction and his thirst for nuclear weapons. We know beyond a shadow of doubt that even after defeat in the Gulf War, and even while the United Nations inspectors were attempting to verify Iraq's United Nations mandated disarmament, Saddam Hussein's regime continued his covert and comprehensive plans to acquire those weapons and the means to deliver them.All of these facts are established and known, and the President made them all very clear last night. The single question we must answer, the single decision from which all other decisions will naturally descend is what to do about this threat. It is grave. It is immediate, and it will not satisfactorily resolve itself without action. We cannot simply hope that Saddam Hussein will be deterred. He has shown himself to be an inveterate and dangerous gambler.We cannot simply hope that Saddam will not share weapons of mass destruction technology with terrorists. We know al Qaeda elements have already been at work soliciting Iraqi aid in this field. We cannot simply hope that U.N. inspections will rout out Saddam Hussein's weapons of terror. We know that he has defeated inspections for 10 years and is prepared to risk his regime in order to preserve them.Madam Speaker, hope is not a plan; nor will hope ensure our national security. I believe that we all want a nonviolent resolution to this problem.As the President said last night, ``Military action is not imminent or unavoidable.''Madam Speaker, it is not our first choice, but the only way for us to be clear about Saddam's obligation is for us to speak with one voice. Madam Speaker, we have fought wars that we have not declared, and we have declared wars that we have not fought. Let us hope that this is one of the latter.I believe that authorizing the President to use force, if necessary, is the best way to avoid war and is the best way to make clear that preservation of peace depends on Iraq's compliance with its obligations. But if we must use force, then the central issue to my mind is how to secure the greatest and the broadest international endorsement for our proposed course of action.Madam Speaker, since World War II, the United States, on the basis of broad bipartisan consensus, has been leading the world through the creation of a system of international security based on shared norms and institutions. The international order our Nation has established and sustained since the presidencies of Roosevelt and Truman and Eisenhower, the so-called Pax Americana, has succeeded for decades because it has been perceived internationally as legitimate and is not just self-interested. The peace of the Americans, not just the peace for the Americans.The goodwill that we have built up for decades is not simply the product of our support for democracy and free markets but rather our enduring and substantial material support for international institutions such as the United Nations and NATO and, through them, our commitment to international cooperation in the pursuit of global security. The global idea that we are all in this together has enabled our country to lead for decades without any significant backlash.The real questions that we should be asking are not about whether something should be done about Iraq. Something must be done. Our national security requires it. The key questions that remain are about international order and our relationship with the rest of the world.The President's speech to the U.N. seemed to be the first step in our effort to build a coalition. Last night's speech was another. These were necessary efforts, and we must continue. Because a preventative war devoid of any sort of international consensus is not a precedent that we choose to establish. Our Nation used to refer to that kind of project as aggression. Like it or not, we will need the international community when and if the time comes for the reconstruction of Iraq.But beyond our efforts in Iraq, we continue to need the international support for the war on terror. We cannot scorn international concerns and reservations without lasting harm to our larger and longer-term objectives.While I am prepared to endorse the President's request for authorization to use force to respond to the threat by Iraq, I continue to have grave concerns about the administration's complete failure to explain what an unsupported war on Iraq will do to our efforts to establish a stable global order. I continue to have grave concerns about the administration's complete failure to explain how an unsupported war in Iraq will advance international cooperation in the war on terror. And I continue to have grave concerns about the administration's complete failure to explain how we will restore a post-Saddam Iraq to the family of nations.Madam Speaker, all that being said, we must recognize Saddam Hussein's regime is a reign of evil, promising the world nothing but terror and death. A decent people have an obligation to confront evil in its womb.Madam Speaker, I will support the resolution, but I fear that defeating Iraq and deposing Saddam are likely to be orders of magnitude much easier than repairing a potential breach in international perceptions about our Nation's intentions and our values.",

    "title": "U.S.-INDIA RELATIONS",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, as we move toward the conclusion of the 107th Congress, I think it is fair to say that we will look back on this period as a time when South Asia became a major focus of U.S. foreign policy. Obviously, Afghanistan has occupied much of our attention, as our forces have routed the Taliban and Al Qaeda forces, which had turned that country into a base for international terrorism.But a South Asian relationship that has perhaps received fewer headlines, but which I believe will prove to have a long-lasting and deep value for both countries, is our growing relationship with India.After September 11, when so much changed for America and the world, India immediately stepped forward in full support and solidarity with the United States in the war on terrorism. But this level of cooperation and partnership between the U.S. and India in the struggle against terrorism was nothing new. The two countries had actually been cooperating on counter-terrorism efforts since the establishment of the U.S.-India Joint Working Group on Counter-terrorism in January 2000. Further, this cooperative system for addressing the problem of terrorism was part of a much larger realignment in relations between the world's two largest democracies.When President Clinton traveled to India in March 2000--the first visit by an American President to India in more than 20 years--bilateral relations had already been showing signs of slow but steady improvement. President Clinton's trip to India, and the visit a few months later in September 2000 by Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee--marking the first time that two lndo-U.S. summits had taken place in the same year--resulted in the development of a new framework for bilateral relations that was spelled out in ``A Vision for the 21st Century.'' This Vision Statement called for a greater institutional dialogue, including a U.S.-India Financial and Economic Forum, a U.S.-India Commercial Dialogue, a U.S.-India Working Group on Trade, and joint groups dealing with such wide-ranging issues as energy and environment, science and technology exchange, and cooperation on the promotion of democracy internationally. I am pleased to report that these cooperative bodies have been active and have produced substantive results.Since assuming office in early 2001, the Bush Administration has continued the progress begun by its predecessor. After 9/11, there was an upsurge in U.S.-India relations, given the urgent need to address the source of terrorism in Afghanistan. While India and the United States are united as democracies that have been the victims of horrendous terrorist violence, much of it coming from the same extremist sources based in Afghanistan and Pakistan, our relationship is by no means limited to our alliance in the war on terrorism. At their November 2001 meeting, President Bush and Prime Minister Vajpayee issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to continue transforming our relationship, including increased exchanges and technical cooperation in the defense and security areas. They also called for policies to enhance the economic and commercial ties between our nations and agreed to dialogue and cooperation in the areas of energy, the environment, health, space, export controls, science, biotechnology and information technology. The cordial relationship between President Bush and Prime Minister Vajpayee, like the warm ties that President Clinton continues to enjoy with the Prime Minister, serves as a visible symbol of the friendship and partnership between our countries on so many levels. In his visit to the United States this September for the UN General Assembly meeting, Prime Minister Vajpayee attended commemoration ceremonies for 9/11, demonstrating again that the Indian and American peoples stand together as supporters of democracy committed to standing steadfastly against the scourge of international terrorism.Mr. Speaker, India's commitment to democracy is not just some abstract principle. For 50 years, India's political system has been based on free and fair elections. We have just witnessed the latest example of this commitment in India's state of Jammu and Kashmir. Despite the ongoing threat of terrorism, much of it emanating from neighboring Pakistan, four rounds of elections have just been completed in Jammu and Kashmir for the state assembly. Despite efforts by the terrorists to intimidate voters and candidates, the elections have been successfully concluded. Voter turnout has been estimated at a respectable 44 percent, and the early indications are that the current ruling party will lose its majority in the assembly. The fact that the state government will peacefully change hands as the result of an elections is but further evidence that India's democracy is not only alive and well, but thriving.Mr. Speaker the progress in U.S.-India relations that has been made over the last several years has allowed us to broaden and deepen a relationship with a sister democracy in a part of the world where the United States has significant interests. It is a relationship that can only continue to bring both countries great benefits.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise today to pay tribute to a great man who has dedicated much of his life to improving relations between Taiwan and the United States. Dr. Lyushun Shen has served as Deputy Representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) for the past four years and will be leaving Washington soon to accept a new challenge as Director General of TECRO in Geneva. At his new post, he will be working on, among other things, finally bringing Taiwan into its rightful place as a member of the World Health Organization, a development I strongly support.As the Deputy Representative of TECRO, Dr. Shen has carried out many responsibilities ranging from interacting with Members of Congress to serving as a senior liaison with the large and vibrant Taiwanese community in the United States. As almost all of our colleagues know, TECRO--Taiwan's unofficial embassy here in Washington--and its employees are devoted to making certain the United States and Taiwan work closely on matters of mutual concern and importance in the areas of trade, investment, commerce, culture and security.Mr. Speaker, Dr. Shen is an old Washington hand. He is presently serving his third tour of duty in Washington, where he previously was Director of TECRO's Public Affairs Division from 1994 to 1996, as well as a Staff Consultant for Congressional Liaison from 1982 to 1986. In between his postings in Washington, Dr. Shen remained focused on U.S.-Taiwan relations. From 1996 to 1999 he was Director General, Department of North American Affairs at Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and from 1991 to 1993 he headed the Kansas City office of the Coordination Council for North American Affairs, TECRO's predecessor organization. This important position gave Dr. Shen a firsthand perspective on America's heartland, which oftentimes offers a different perspective than Washington.Dr. Shen's professional experience has been built on a strong academic foundation. Dr. Shen received both his master's degree in international relations and his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. While working in Kansas City, he was a visiting professor of international relations at the University of Kansas.Mr. Speaker, Dr. Shen has developed many friendships and a wealth of goodwill on Capitol Hill. He has served as a trusted resource of information regarding Taiwan and Cross Straight relations. Many fellow members of this body have been fortunate to have traveled to Taiwan with Dr. Shen.Mr. Speaker, I am certain that our colleagues will join me in extending our best wishes to my good friend Lyushun as he takes up his new assignment. We also hope that he will be able to make his way back to Washington in the future. In the meantime, we expect many great things from this tireless advocate for Taiwan's interests. He is indeed an important asset for the 22 million people on Taiwan.",

Soon, the people of Port Washington began to organize daily for environmental action and Myron's organization slowly grew from a handful of members to a prestigious and influential non-profit action group. Today, Residents for a More Beautiful Port Washington boasts more than 2,000 active members who cross political, racial, religious, ethnic and economic divides to preserve and enhance the environment of Port Washington and the surrounding communities.Among the major projects the group has spearheaded are: protecting drinking water, building waterfront trails, contributing thousands of dollars to the Port Washington Board of Education to fund projects which helps students to learn about our ecosystem, planning the Main Street Park and Town Dock, and of course, planting hundreds of trees throughout Port Washington.As the founder and chairman of Residents for a More Beautiful Port Washington, Myron Blumenfeld has consistently displayed his lifelong passion and spirit to improve our environment and our quality of life. A graduate of Syracuse University with a Masters Degree in Business from New York University, Myron was vice president of Bloomingdales for 34 years where he routinely answered his phone with ``Save Hempstead Harbor''. Myron's commitment to the environment was quickly recognized by then Governor Cuomo who appointed Myron as Chairman of the Long Island Parks Commission. As Chairman, Myron initiated the first Long Island Parks environmental education program. Myron also served as Chair of the Sierra Club's Atlantic Chapter and formed the Sierra Club's first Long Island Chapter. In addition, Myron served on the boards of the Environmental Planning Lobby and American Friends of Neot Kedumin. In November of 2002, Myron and the Residents for a More Beautiful Port Washington received the well deserved Environmental Advocates of New York State Award.Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent such an exceptional individual and commend Myron Blumenfeld for his dedication to preserving and working for the beautification of Port Washington. On May 18, 2003, Residents for a More Beautiful Port Washington will recognize Myron's important contributions at its 35th Annual Gala. I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to please join me in wishing Myron Blumenfeld and the Residents for a More Beautiful Port Washington many more years of success as they celebrate their 35th Anniversary.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I love our flag and that for which it stands. It stands for a Nation founded by people fleeing from an oppressive regime. It stands for freedoms, not the least of which is the freedom of opinion and the unimpeded expression thereof, including the freedom to protest.Bear in mind, this was a Nation founded by protesters. When our Founding Fathers sought to guarantee these freedoms, they created not a flag but a Constitution, debating the meaning of each and every word, every amendment, every one of which gives people rights. They did not debate a flag. The flag would become a symbol of these rights.There are those who would have fewer rights. Why? What is the threat to the Republic that drives us to erode the Bill of Rights?Well, someone burned the flag. Whatever happened to fighting to the death for somebody's right to disagree? We now choose instead to react by taking away a form of the right to protest. Most people abhor flag burners, but even a despicable, low-life malcontent has a right to disagree and disagree in an obnoxious fashion if he wishes. That is the true test of free expression, and we here are about to fail that test.These are rare but vile acts of desecration that have been cited by those who would propose changing our founding document, but these acts do not harm anybody. If a jerk burns a flag, America is not threatened. If a jerk burns a flag, democracy is not under siege. If a jerk burns a flag, freedom is not at risk. We are offended. To change our Constitution because someone offends us is, in itself, unconscionable.Hitler banned the burning of the flag. Mussolini banned the burning of the flag. Saddam banned the burning of the flag. Dictatorships fear flag burners. The reason our flag is different is because it stands for burning the flag.Though we in proper suits may decry the protests and the protestors and the flag burners, protecting their right is the true stuff of a democracy. The real threat to our society is not the occasional burning of a flag, but the permanent banning of the burners. The real threat is that some of us have now mistaken the flag for a religious icon to be worshiped as pagans would, rather than to be kept as the beloved symbol of our freedom that is to be cherished.It is not the flag burners who threaten democracy. Rather, it is those who would deny them. In the name of our Founding Fathers, save us from those who would put up this defense.The Constitution was written by intellectual giants and is here today being nibbled by small men with press secretaries. If flag burners offend us, do not beat a cowardly retreat by rushing to ban them. Protesters, like grapes, cannot be eliminated by stomping on them. Meet their ideas with bigger ideas for an ever better America to protect the flag by protecting democracy, not by retreating from it.We cannot kill a flag. It is a symbol, and yes, patriots have died; but recall what they have died for. They have died for liberty. They have died for democracy. They have died for the right to speak out in protest. They have died for values.The flag is a symbol of those values. What they died for are American principles. Saying that people died for the flag is symbolic language. The Constitution gives us our rights. The Constitution guarantees our liberties. The Constitution embodies our freedoms. It is our substance. The flag is the symbol for which it stands.True patriots choose substance over symbolism. Diminish one right and it shall forever stand for less. Do not pass this amendment. Do not diminish the Constitution. Do not cheapen the flag.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a great American and a great New Yorker, Solomon Newborn, who passed away on June 16, 2003 at the age of 86, after a life dedicated to public service, his community of Plainview, the Town of Oyster Bay, his religion, and--most importantly--his family.After growing up as the poor child of Austrian immigrants, Solomon worked his way through New York University, where he received both his Bachelor of Science in Accounting and his Master's Degree in Education.During World War II, Sol decided to enlist in the Navy. But the Navy told him that it was no longer enlisting men, so Sol, determined to serve his country and his flag, enlisted in the Army Air Corps, the forerunner of the United States Air Force. Solomon Newborn became a decorated Captain who served valiantly in flight and in uniform fighting the Nazi regime.Sol's dedication to the highest standards of his profession was always evident in his work. A Certified Public Accountant and recognized specialist in the fields of municipal auditing, Solomon was elected the Receiver of Taxes of the town of Oyster Bay in 1996, a position he held until 1983. He was also an author on taxation and municipal accounting, subjects he taught at Adelphi University and Queens College, my alma mater.Sol also understood how important it was to be a part of a community. As soon as he and his wife, Rita, moved into their home in Plainview, New York, in 1953, they began to develop the idea for the Plainview Jewish Center. Sol was not only one of the founders, but the synagogue's first president. Today, The Plainview Jewish Center continues to thrive as one of the largest synagogues on Long Island. Ironically, Sol died a full half century to the day after the first planning meeting was held in the Newborn's own living room.Solomon Newborn was the organizer of the Annual Brotherhood Conference of Plainview Service Clubs, served as Chairman of the Red Cross for Plainview and was the Senior Vice Commander of the Jewish War Veterans in Hicksville. His tireless efforts on behalf of his community and various groups have earned him the ``Man of the Year'' award from Yeshiva University and the ``Masada'' award from the United Jewish Federation.Solomon is survived by Rita--his wife of 54 years, four children and one granddaughter: Ira, Evan, Jud, Kym and Stacey.Solomon Newborn was the kind of man who led by his heart and always encouraged other public officials to be true to themselves. I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to please join me in honoring and thanking Solomon for his service to our nation and to extend to his family our deepest sympathies and condolences.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I am reminded of the old vaudeville act where the guy goes to a doctor and he says ``Doctor, Doctor it hurts when I do this. What should I do? And the doctor says, `Do not do that.' ''Every action has a reaction. And people who perpetrate violence and commit acts of violence provoke responses.I rise in strong support of the resolution. I want to commend the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), the author, for bringing it to us. The resolution brings something critical to our discussion about the future of the Israeli/Palestinian peace process, and that is moral clarity. We should be absolutely clear about this. Neither the Israeli soldier nor the American soldier who defends his nation by preemptively eliminating terrorists can with any decency be compared to the terrorist who intentionally sets out to murder innocent women and children on a bus or in a disco or in a pizzeria or in a shopping mall or in a supermarket or going to work in the Twin Towers in New York. Terrorism and the defense against terrorism are not a cycle of violence. Active defense against terrorism including strikes against terrorists and terrorist leaders and those who harbor them is a moral obligation of a free and democratic society. We do it because it is right, and Israel does it for the same reason.Tempting as it may be, peace cannot be achieved through delusion, pretending that all parties to this conflict are of equal goodwill or everyone shares the belief that the two-state solution is a recipe for failure. Hamas and Islamic jihad engage in terrorism not to create the state of Palestine, but to destroy the State of Israel. Their victims are Jews not by coincidence of citizenship, but by active design. These are not just misguided militants or eager extremists, as our newspapers might label them. They are fanatical haters, murderous zealots committed to destroying both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, driving out both Jews and Christians and building an Islamic state on the ashes.Mr. Speaker, peace may be possible; but it is not automatic. It is almost certainly impossible until these hate groups are crushed. The Palestinian Authority cannot succeed. It cannot fulfill its mandate as the single voice of the Palestinian people. It cannot perform its historic role as the agent of Palestinian statehood as long as these groups are allowed to exist. In the words of a former Israeli prime minister, we must pursue the peace process as if there were no terrorists, and we must pursue terrorists as if there were no peace process.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.Mr. Chairman, the Saudis have been bad, bad, bad, but this amendment makes everything worse, worse, worse, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.There seems to be a lot of confusion because there is an array of speakers we have seen who are usually on the same side on these issues. And I have to tell you what the real problem is. The real problem is that there are two Saudi Arabias. One is the Wahabi fanatics, who are prone to terrorism, and the other is the government and the royal family that is holding on by their very rich, and sometimes greedy, claws to the tenets of power and making money.It is in their interest to control the terrorists and to eliminate the terrorists. If you had to put your money down on one of these players, which one would you pick? The answer is, and my bet for a lousy $100,000 goes with the government. This list that we would put the Saudis on, every other nation on that list is a government sponsor of terrorism. The Saudis have terrorism, but it is not sponsored by the government. Osama bin Laden's number one enemy is not the United States, it is not Israel, it is their own government of Saudi Arabia. This wicked genius that did such damage to our country and to my city picked 14 Saudis to be on those planes for a specific reason, because he knew what it would do to the reputation of the country that has outlawed him, that has banned him, that has taken away his citizenship. They do not need our bucks. What they need is a little bit of encouragement, a little bit of encouragement when they do do the right thing, which is not very often. But they are trying, too, to rid themselves and the rest of the world of this terrorist threat that promises to topple their government and then some others.This money that we are talking about is to bring some people in the military from Saudi Arabia here to join with our military people to teach them how to deal with these terrorists, how to cooperate with us. Anybody who knows anything about the intelligence on this issue, anybody who has studied it in depth knows that the names and addresses of so many of the terrorists that have been picked up in the Middle East and other places in the world have been provided to us by the Saudi Government. They cannot proudly stand up and say that because it would threaten them more than it does right now.This amendment is the amendment to bite your nose to spite your face. Sure, we want to kick the Saudis around; sure, they have done some terrible things. But if we want to help those in Saudi Arabia who want to correct it, the right vote on this is ``no'' on this amendment. Let us not pander, let us not trip over each other to show our reasonableness on antiterrorism. Let us think this issue through and do the right thing, the right thing for America, the right thing for the world, the right thing for the international community, and the right thing for all those people who want to end terrorism. Let our military and our intelligence people have the benefit of meeting with those people from Saudi Arabia that want to help in this situation.Vote ``no'' on this amendment.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Meeks-Crowley-Ackerman amendment to prevent the unnecessary closing of the St. Albans Primary &amp; Extended Care Center. This center provides primary care and offers specialized geriatric programs and restorative rehabilitation to veterans from New York City and Nassau County. To close it would be a disservice to the Veterans of Queens and Nassau County.At a time, when we have sent over 150,000 troops to fight in Iraq, it is indefensible that these men and women may come home to find that the Veterans Center is no longer there. Closing this facility would be an insult to those who have served our country so bravely.The Veterans Administration is currently dangerously under-funded. To save dollars, the Administration wants to close Veterans' health centers. However, the administration did manage to find the money to give the wealthiest Americans a tremendous tax cut. We must fulfill our promises to our veterans and continue to provide access to the quality health care they were promised.Currently, veterans sometimes have to wait months for doctors' appointments at VA Hospitals. Closing St. Albans will simply exacerbate this problem. If St. Albans is closed, veterans will have to go to other already overcrowded facilities in New York.We owe it to our veterans to provide them access to quality health care. St. Albans needs to remain open.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an icon of public service, May W. Newburger, for her exemplary career, dedicated to the people of the Town of North Hempstead, Nassau County and New York State.May Newburger has had a long and distinguished career, to the great benefit of the people. May spent eight highly productive years, from 1978 to 1986, in the New York State Assembly. She served as Town Councilwoman in North Hempstead from 1991 to 1993, and was the first woman to be elected chief executive of a Nassau County town. Now in her fifth term, she has served as Town Supervisor of North Hempstead since 1993.As Town Supervisor, May Newburger has been the driving force behind long-term strategic financial planning in North Hempstead, most notably through the Debt Management and Capital Plans. She has already transformed a $7-million budget deficit into a surplus of $7.7 million, and through her leadership and foresight, she will have reduced the Town's debt by $107 million over the next ten years. This planning has helped move the Town from the lowest bond rating in its history to its highest ever.Mr. Speaker, under May Newburger's dynamic leadership, North Hempstead was named ``Town of the Year 1999'' by the Long Island Development Corporation, and received the ``Quality of Life'' award from the Long Island Division of the American Society of Civil Engineers. May also spearheaded the initiative to reclaim the Morewood Property, an environmentally damaged area, turning it into the Harbor Links municipal golf course. This prescient, breathtaking project is one of America's most environmentally friendly championship level golf courses, winning the ``Environmental Stewardship Award'' as well as the prestigious ``Audubon Signature Distinction.'' Supervisor Newburger also successfully lobbied the Environmental Protection Agency for $200,000 to designate New Cassel as a Brownfields Pilot Community.Throughout her career in public service, May Newburger has served on many state and national committees and has received innumerable awards and honors. In 1981, she served as a New York State Delegate to the White House Conference on Families; from 1987 to 1989 she chaired the American Jewish Congress' National Commission on Women's Equality. She was also a member of the State Judicial Committee on Women in the Courts, the Governor's Commission of Domestic Violence and the State Commission on Child Care.Mr. Speaker, the good citizens of North Hempstead and Nassau County are truly blessed to have had the great benefit of May Newburger's vision, leadership, dedication and drive for these many years. Her commitment to her constituents has never flagged; she has been indefatigable in the cause of improving the lives of others. I am awed by her accomplishments, humbled to have known her, and very proud to call her my friend.Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to please rise and join me now in honoring May W. Newburger, in celebrating her outstanding career in public service, and in extending our best wishes to her as she goes on to meet new challenges.",

As this historic day approaches, I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate President Chen Shui-bian and the people of Taiwan for their continuing political reforms and economic achievements.Mr. Speaker, over the last decade, Taiwan has established itself as a strong and successful model of democracy. Under the leadership of President Chen, the government and people of Taiwan have continued to implement domestic reforms and strengthen diplomatic relations with surrounding nations. This continuing commitment to democratic progress can best be seen in next year's elections. With both the presidential and legislative elections scheduled for 2004, next year will likely prove to be a politically dynamic and exciting year for Taiwan. I applaud the robust multiparty democracy that Taiwan has become.Mr. Speaker, along with its democratic development, Taiwan remains an important economic partner for the United States. We are Taiwan's largest market, but Taiwan is our 7th largest trading partner. This is a remarkable achievement for this island nation of 22 million people. Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization last year will set the stage for even greater opportunities for U.S. business.Mr. Speaker, as Taiwan continues to earn international acclaim as a model of democratic progress and free market economics, I call on my colleagues to join me in commending Taiwan during the upcoming celebration of Taiwan's National Day.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise, reluctantly, in support of this supplemental appropriations bill.I do so not because the President has called us to this task, but in spite of that fact.I do so not because of my sympathy for the people of Baghdad, although I am sympathetic, but because failure is not an option.The Middle East was, before the war, it remains today, and it will be tomorrow, a region of critical importance to our Nation. We have close allies who depend on America for their freedom; we have vital economic interests; we have ongoing challenges from regimes like Iran and Syria that continue to sponsor terrorism and pursue weapons of mass destruction. We can not walk away.I rise in support of this massive $87 billion expenditure not because it is the final step in securing Iraq, but with the knowledge that it is in fact just the one more step on a long and hard road this Congress agreed to embark upon in October of last year.If anyone here thinks we just have to swallow this one bitter pill, they are sadly deluded.Mr. Chairman, there should be no mistake: over the next few years, Iraq is going to cost this Nation billions upon billions of dollars. And because of the majority's tax-cutting fanaticism, these billions are going to come in the form of debt--to be paid by our children and our children's children. And this, because the majority party has squandered our surplus by their tax pay off to their wealthiest contributors.Nonetheless, I believe this is money that must be spent. Despite the administration's lies. Despite the President's massaging of the facts. Despite the shameful manipulation and distortion of intelligence that was used to justify the war. Despite the inept and pathetic failure of our diplomacy before the war. Despite the astonishing incompetence of our planning for after the war. Despite the stupid fantasies about an exile takeover and a speedy exit. Despite the incomprehensible pig-headedness that characterized our initial reconstruction efforts. Despite our arrogance toward the international community and so many of our allies.Despite all these appalling failures and breaches of public trust, there is still the necessity of protecting our Nation. There are still American men and women struggling to accomplish our Nation's tasks in Iraq; they need and are entitled to our support. There are still Islamist terrorists pouring into Iraq to pursue their crusade of terrorism against our Nation; they need to be stopped, they need to be destroyed. There are still millions of Iraqis who are counting on us not to abandon them to mercies of Saddam's loyalists and the invading jihadis, they need to be reassured we will not betray them. These vital tasks cannot continue without the money in this bill.In the context of September 11th can anyone really believe that abandoning Iraq would not produce a greater haven for terrorists there then the Taliban produced in Afghanistan?There is no easy way out of this. Pursuit of a quick or cheap solution is as fanciful as a mirage in the desert.The rest of the world is not going to clean up this mess. While we should aggressively pursue every avenue to involve the international community in this tremendous and critical project, we cannot expect the world to come to our rescue. The Bush Administration did our Nation a terrible disservice in conducting our international relations in such an arrogant and high-handed way. We have alienated much of the world and repairing this error, I fear, will take far longer than resolving the debts we will accumulate from rebuilding Iraq.Since 1776, our choice as Americans has always been to act, to take our fate in our own hands. We may appeal to heaven, but we should not depend on divine assistance. We may solicit the aid of allies, but we must not place our national destiny in the hands of others. We may fervently hope for success, but we cannot allow hope to be the keystone of our policies. Our Nation has been built and sustained by action, by deeds, and by hard choices.Today we are called upon to make just such a hard choice: to open the American treasury to rebuild a defeated nation, and to pile up debt upon ourselves and our children (having yesterday given away our ``rainy-day funds'' to Republican rain-makers) so that we might pursue a more secure world tomorrow.Mr. Chairman, we don't have to like it, and I can tell you, I don't. I am bitter and fighting mad about the sly deceit and mendacity that has characterized this Administration's Iraq policy and that is continuing to this day.But we have a job to do and it costs money. It costs a lot of money. And it will cost even more money in the future.The alternative, however, is not just ruins left in Baghdad, the alternative is a failed state, a new home for terrorists and their plans. The choice is fighting terrorism by cleaning up the squalor in which terrorism thrives, or taking our chances, and hoping everything turns out OK.I can not--I will not--vote to put our Nation's future into the unthinking hands of fate, or worse, into the hands of the people we are fighting at this very moment in Iraq.We must succeed. I urge all Members to support the bill.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to call the attention of the House to a wonderful event that will occur this Friday, October 24, in my district: the 50th anniversary and rededication of Temple Emanuel of Great Neck. This synagogue, since its founding, has been a vital force in my community, instilling hope, providing opportunities for prayer, education and fellowship, and acting as a vigorous agent of tzedaka, of righteousness, charity and social action.Since 1969, this energetic congregation has been led by Dr. Robert Widom, an exemplary rabbi, a community icon, a wise, decent and kind man, and, I'm proud to say, my close friend and counselor. Under his leadership, Temple Emanuel has grown, thrived and fulfilled its mission of providing a home to a dynamic liberal Judaism that promises and delivers both continuity and change.Mr. Speaker, this wonderful anniversary recalls the divine promise of redemption made by Isaiah who foresaw the restoration of the Beit HaMikdash, the holy temple in Jerusalem: ``Behold I will set down gems as your flooring stones and lay your foundation with sapphires. I will set your window frames with ruby and make your gates of carbuncle stones and your entire boundary of precious stones. All your children will be students of the Lord, and your children's peace will be abundant.''This joyous 50th anniversary of Temple Emanuel will celebrate and amplify the echoes of the profound spirit of the Great Temple. This anniversary will rightfully celebrate the creation, half a century ago, of a place for Jews to join together to commune with God, to ask for atonement and to celebrate the holidays and mitzvot established in the Torah. For a generation, Temple Emanuel has been the place for hundreds of Jewish families to celebrate simchas, births, b'nei mitzvot, and weddings; the life events which connect individuals and families to our community and to their faith.The structure of this synagogue is not mere mortar or brick; it is not wood, stone or steel. This house of prayer, this home for a community, is founded on centuries of faith and tradition, it is built up with love and dedication, and its roof is an abiding faith in the promise made to King Solomon so long ago. Even as this congregation has matured, this structure of spirit has not aged.Those of us who know this congregation, who know the people who, for 50 years have made it hum with activity and life and spirit, we know it's not just a temple, it's not just a synagogue: It's a shul, a spiritual home, a place that reflects the highest aspirations of an ancient people living proud and free in this great Nation.Mr. Speaker, in the Jewish tradition, when a book of study is completed, traditionally we celebrate the success by offering encouragement to immediately return to the work ahead. This anniversary, this celebration of 50 years of sustaining Jewish life in a profound and modem way, is a real and deeply satisfying achievement. But it is an anniversary which only promises greater things.Mr. Speaker, the words we say are ``Chazak! Chazak! v'nitchazayk!'' Be strong! Be strong! And may you be strengthened! Mr. Speaker, I ask all of the Members of the House to stand and join me in offering Temple Emanuel a hearty yasher koach, and best wishes for the next 50 years.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I did not intend to speak on this. In listening and thinking this through, I feel compelled to take the well.I am one of the few on this side of the aisle that voted with President Bush the first time, as well as this President Bush, because I thought it was important, the right thing to do, that those of us who have said ``never again'' to tyrants must protect not just ourselves, but other people as well, and step up to the plate, and that it would be sinful not to do what we have to do in ridding the world of a tyrant. I am not sorry that I participated in that, because, indeed, it was the right thing to do, and remains so.But things have happened and things have changed as we watch what has evolved, as we watch an administration that ran for office and continually talked about bringing morality back to government and taking personal responsibility, and suddenly seeing the evolving of what has happened here, which is truly mind-boggling.Personal responsibility. Who knew what in the White House and when? Personal responsibility. Things starting to go wrong.Where is the plan? Those of us who supported the action always said we were going to win the war. There was no doubt about it. You could not find an oddsmaker in Las Vegas to say that Saddam Hussein was going to win the war. The day, the amount of time, the casualties, that was always a question.But the question that we pressed in the Committee on International Relations was, can you win the peace? What we have here is a Secretary of War who has now become the Secretary of Peace, and he does not know how to do it.The President stood here in this House and said to us Members of both bodies assembled, ``British intelligence tells us this.'' I think it is what Nixon called ``plausible deniability.''I never heard a President say someone else's intelligence told us this. He was warned. He was warned by the CIA Director that that intelligence was wrong. Blame the British. Blame the CIA Director. Blame the brave men in the Navy on the Abraham Lincoln.What happened to personal responsibility? Where is the plan? We have been deceived; we have been lied to, we in the Congress and the American people as well, and that is intolerable. People took the oath of office to tell the truth. Where is the truth?Indeed, this is a dilemma. We have so many American lives on the line in that country, but the President owes us a plan. A company declares bankruptcy for a half a million dollars, they have to have a plan. For $87 billion, there should be a plan. What is the plan? Nobody knows the plan.``Trust us.'' Well, I have run out of trust in this administration. I do not mind that the emperor has no clothes; I mind that the emperor does not have a plan, because lives are at stake.We want to protect our troops. Bring back a bill that would protect the troops. We are not going to leave them hanging out there. But to spend $87 billion, and nobody knows how, nobody knows why, nobody knows where, nobody knows when, is something that is absolutely unconscionable, and something in which I can no longer participate.I will be voting no.",

I want to offer my best wishes and congratulations to all the men and women who have contributed their time, energy and support to bring this tremendous project into being.America and New York in particular have been blessed by a growing number of Jews of Iranian descent, who have made an enormous contribution to the health and vitality of our Jewish community. Owing to their bitter experience as a persecuted religious minority in Iran, they--more than most--have come to understand the meaning of the prophet Jeremiah, ``If you will remain in this land, then I will build you up and not pull you down; I will plant you, and not pluck you up. . . .'' The expansion of this community's physical presence through the construction of this center is a sign of continuing growth and maturity, and one which I happily encourage.Mr. Speaker, as always, breaking ground on a new religious center is a joyous event. Such structures are gifts to the future and expressions of our most admirable goals for our posterity. The Young Mashadi Jewish Center in Great Neck will include classrooms and a playground for children, a youth center for young adults, a recreational lounge to accommodate social, cultural, and educational programs for the community seniors, and other spaces available to host all those events which connect individuals and families to their community.This center will be built with love, dedication, determination and an abiding faith in the future of the Jewish people. In short, it will be a center that reflects the values of the people who built it.Mr. Speaker, in the Jewish faith, when a book of study is completed, the accomplishment is celebrated by offering encouragement to immediately return to the work ahead.

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 15 and congratulate my colleague Mr. Wilson of South Carolina for his sponsorship of the resolution.Madam Speaker, the resolution before us today commends India on its celebration of Republic Day and urges continued strong bilateral relations between the United States and India. But there is much more to celebrate than simply India's Republic Day. There are the commonalities between the U.S. and India, in particular both are thriving multi-cultural democracies. India is the largest and the U.S. is the oldest. This year both nations are in the midst of the great democratic tradition of elections. India's elections begin later this month and run through the beginning of April.Beyond our common experiences with democracy, the United States and India have been growing ever closer over the last several years. Beginning with President Clinton's trip to India in 2000, the U.S.-India relationship has truly blossomed over the last several years.In the immediate aftermath of the horrendous attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, India was the first nation to step forward and offer unqualified support and assistance to us. Just a few months later, India suffered a devastating attack in the heart of its democracy, the parliament building in New Delhi. These events underscore the fact that both nations have faced, and continue to face, serious threats from global terrorist organizations.These unfortunate events have led to a significant expansion of the U.S.-India relationship into areas where our two nations had not previously cooperated: defense and counter-terrorism. Evidence of the new and intense level of cooperation in these areas can be found in the most recent joint exercises between air force units of the United States and India in central India just last month.On the other aspects of our relationship, like the newly announced U.S.-India Strategic Partnership and a steady stream of senior level visits in both capitals speak volumes regarding the robust nature of our relationship. So it is only fitting Mr. Speaker, that the Congress, join the chorus of voices in recognizing that the oldest and largest democracies are on a new and welcome path bilaterally.Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, never would I have thought that defending the Constitution would be so lonely a job on the floor of the United States House of Representatives. Do not get me wrong, I believe in decency and Mary Poppins and all things nice; but what is at stake here is freedom of speech and the assault thereon.I become more and more concerned about the concentration of the media in the hands of so few players, that kind of media power concentrated in the hands of so few and influenced specifically by the far right wing and religious right in this country.We talk about the President and the Presidency, and we say that the President has a bully pulpit, and he does. That does not concern me. What concerns me is the bullyism and the bullying that is going on. When networks and stations and people-owned medias are afraid to be critical of the administration, to impose a fine on speech that you do not like of a half a million dollars a shot, multiplied by 30 or 300 stations, does not have a chilling effect. It has a freezing-out effect where people will be afraid to speak out.It is not for us to put limits on free speech. The public decides what they want to listen to and wants to hear. They can change the channel, they can change the station, they can turn it off. To talk about motherhood and breast feeding as something that is good is fine, but people are offended by a breast? Is that obscene? Maybe it was in poor taste at the time, but is it obscene?That Howard Stern on the radio would be threatened with extinction from broadcast because he did not hang up in time on somebody that called in, that was not the issue. The issue is that he is beginning to speak out against the President and the administration, and he is paying the price because of the pressure on the media by the President and his media cronies.This concentration of the media denies the public access to the right to speak out. It is not just speech that we agree with and we think is pretty that we have to tolerate. The test of freedom of speech is if we tolerate ugly speech, obnoxious speech, and speech that we disagree with. And saying that we are protecting the country and the children, what about personal responsibility? Everybody should protect their own children from what they do not want to listen to or see.These become weapons of mass communication, and no one will own them except those who have the hands on the levers of power in the White House and their friends.That is what we find obscene? What is obscene is public officials lying to the public, lying about public policy, lying about education. It is about not providing enough money for AIDS or cancer; that is what is obscene in this country. We need people to defend our Constitution. We need people to defend freedom of speech, and that is really what is at stake here. This is going to become a very dark day in American history. We are going down the slippery slope of limiting our Constitution and the protections that it gives to the American people.Mr. Chairman, I for one will be voting against this bill.",

    "title": "DAY OF REMEMBRANCE FOR THE HEROES AND MARTYRS OF THE HOLOCAUST",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to call the attention of the House to the Day of Remembrance for the Heroes and Martyrs of the Holocaust. Today is the National Commemoration day, and the Rotunda of the Capitol again will serve as the focal point of America's obligation to remember. Sadly, the Holocaust is not old news, even though the last camp was liberated in 1945, even though the last victim was killed in 1945, even though the Nazi regime fell in 1945.Unfortunately Mr. Speaker, the Holocaust is a current event. It is not then, it is now. It is today, it is this moment. Today in America, Holocaust survivors are still struggling to win back their lost property and overdue compensation. Today in Europe, on the same streets the Nazis declared Judenrein--Jew-free--Jews are again being attacked and assaulted. Today around the world, newspapers and media outlets are spewing vicious, venomous anti-Semitic lies and incitement. Today in other countries, ethnic cleansing is taking place. Today, intolerance, xenophobia, racism, and anti-Semitism are realities in our world, and we cannot ignore this fact.Our obligation as a nation which has adopted the ethos of ``Never Again,'' at a very bare minimum, is to remember. Our national commitment to remember the Holocaust is worth reflecting on and is something we can be proud of as long as we remain vigilant and aware of the unique nature of this tragedy in human history.The American people's commitment is embodied in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and its ongoing mission. The American public also gives generously to non-profit groups that develop and share Holocaust education programs around the country. And most importantly, the United States remains an active and vocal supporter of universal human rights and guardian against the continued risk of genocide. There is, unfortunately, a justification for this activity beyond good heartedness.The shame of this country's refusal to either admit Jewish refugees from Nazi persecution or even to bomb the railway lines to the concentration camps will forever remain a blackmark on our national honor. While this loathsome chapter of our national history cannot be unwritten, we can and must pursue policies that ensure such tragedies never occur again. Refugees continue to deserve the protection and assistance of the United States, and we must never be afraid to intervene to prevent genocide or ethnic cleansing.We must also continue to build and strengthen the bonds of friendship and support between this nation and the State of Israel, which emerged out of the ashes of the Holocaust. While much of the world quibbles over, or disputes entirely, the right of the Jewish people to establish a state in their historic homeland, the United States has never for a moment doubted the rightness and morality of this enterprise or questioned the right of the Jewish people to have a state of their own. Indeed, many of those states which either assisted the Nazis in the liquidation of their Jewish populations, or simply sat by quietly as the Nazis fulfilled their vicious agenda, are today among Israel's most vigorous critics.By contrast, the United States is, and I hope always will be, Israel's closest ally and friend in the international community. I am proud of America's support for Israel, and I think it is no coincidence that the United States and this Congress do so much answer the call of memory the Holocaust demands.Today in the Capitol we recall the stark facts of the Holocaust: that in the years between 1933 and 1945, a modern, cultured, Western nation transformed from a democracy into a dictatorship; that this dictatorship initiated a war not only against the nations of Europe, but against the Jewish people; that to fulfill the mandate of genocide Nazi Germany established ghettos, special military killing units, a bureaucracy to manage the construction and operation of the concentration camps, slave labor camps and extermination camps, and a transportation system to bring Europe's Jews to their doom; and that at the end of the Nazis' regime, their campaign of persecution and annihilation had systematically murdered some 6,000,000 innocent Jews.Mr. Speaker, we must remember this. To ignore the Holocaust is to risk its repetition and to clear a path for deniers and bigots and their agenda of hate. The Holocaust must be remembered. As a moral nation, we can do no less.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 460, and I thank the leadership on both sides of the aisle for their efforts in bringing this important statement of Congressional support for Israel to the floor. Few causes unite our political system as much as support for our beleaguered ally, our fellow democracy, the State of Israel, which long before September 11th was fighting daily against radical Islamist terrorism.American support for Israel has been a key element of our foreign policy ever since President Harry Truman defied his advisors and chose to make the United States the first nation to recognize the new Jewish state in Palestine. That historic decision put the United States firmly in the camp of those who support the return of the Jewish people to Zion, with full sovereignty over their affairs, and perfect legitimacy in their right to live as a free and independent people in their own homeland.In the sixties and seventies, when the rest of the world turned its back on Israel, during those years when the Arab states swore to destroy Israel and drive the Jews into the sea, it was the United States that sold Israel the arms it needed to defend itself. During the eighties and nineties, as the threat of armed conflict began to fade with the supply of U.S. military equipment to the Israel Defense Forces, and diplomacy began to displace the threat of war, it was the United States that led the world toward a peaceful resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. And so it is today.Though many are now willing to grudgingly accept Israel's right to exist, they continue to resist its right to define its own identity as a democratic Jewish state. In this resolution we make perfectly clear our ironclad support for this principle.Though many are now willing to grudgingly acknowledge that Israelis have the right to live in peace, they continue to shrink from recognizing Israel's right to self-defense. In this resolution we make perfectly clear our strong support for that right, particularly in Israel's decision to take the fight against terrorism directly to those responsible for the violence.Though many are now willing to concede that Prime Minister Sharon's plan for disengagement from Gaza is an important step forward, they continue to resist accepting this step as a demonstration of Israel's genuine willingness to make sacrifices for peace. In this resolution we make perfectly clear our appreciation for the real courage and powerful leadership this step represents.Guileful advocates complain about Palestinian refugee rights and speak innocently of their so-called ``right of return.'' We know this is no more than a call for Israel's elimination by demographic means. Shrewd propagandists blandly describe the Palestinian campaign of terror, of bus-bombings and mass-murder in pizzerias and discos as an ``uprising'' and even have the nerve to complain of its cost to Palestinian civilians. We know the terrorists come from among the Palestinian people and it is incumbent on the Palestinian people to stop them without reward. Naive diplomats urge Israel to once again shake hands with terrorist thugs whose promises are worthless and whose intentions are only of Israel's ultimate demise. We know that political reform in the Palestinian Authority is an absolute prerequisite to achieving peace. Outrage and bile are spent in unlimited quantities over Israeli settlements, as if building a house and bombing a bus were somehow equivalent or even related. We know that Israel has already offered to make concessions for peace and that secure and recognized borders are essential for any final status agreement to hold. And we know too that ultimately, all the contentious issues between Israelis and Palestinians, over security, borders, refugees, water, Jerusalem and many others, will have to be decided not on a battlefield, but at a bargaining table; not by suicide bombers but by negotiators.Mr. Speaker, Israel is engaged, as it has been since its first days as a sovereign state, in a fight for its life. Israel's enemies can fulminate and dispense their vitriol. We know, and we make clear today in this resolution that a safe, secure Israel is the fundamental requirement on which Arab-Israeli peace can, one day we hope, be made. I again thank the leaders of the House for bringing this important resolution to the floor and I urge all Members to join me in voting in support of it.",

    "title": "DEPLORING MISUSE OF INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE BY UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY FOR POLITICAL PURPOSE",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution. I strongly believe that this House needs to speak out against the disgraceful ruling by the International Court of Justice, ICJ. I just wish that what we said to the Nation and to the world through this resolution was a more fulsome explanation of U.S. policy about not just Israel's security fence and the appropriate role of the ICJ, but the peace process, the Roadmap, the need for Palestinian political reform, and a complete cessation of Palestinian terrorist violence.In this respect, I would commend to Members' attention H. Con. Res. 390, a resolution I introduced in March together with several distinguished colleagues in the House that highlights not just Israel's right to defend itself, and our strong support for that right, but also speaks clearly about our vital national security interest in resolving the conflict according to the terms of U.N. Security Council resolutions 242, 338, and 1397.Indeed, what makes the ICJ's horrendous ruling more than a meaningless annoyance is its unfortunate potential for misuse. Considering the predilection shown by Palestinian leaders to pursue any line of political action, except for those that require them to set their own house in order and prevent violence from blocking the path back to direct negotiations with Israel, I think we can fully expect the ICJ's ruling to become the latest and most salient Palestinian excuse for inaction, recalcitrance, and doublespeak.By noting the deficiencies of the resolution at hand, I don't mean to understate the wretchedness of the ICJ's ruling. I would note that the court's ruling is as awful as it was predictable, which is to say, entirely. Anyone who expected the ICJ to render an unbiased opinion, forget the shameful call the court actually issued for Israel to, in effect, defend itself by digging its own graves, is several degrees past naive and well on their way toward the title of ``hopeless sucker.''The ICJ's opinion is riddled with flaws and stretches of remarkable illogic. The principal failing, if one can identify just one, is the complete reliance on a pro-Palestinian lens. The result, as clearly demonstrated in the court's opinion, is a misapprehension of the nature of the territory at issue, the nature of the conflict between the parties, the legal standing of the parties and the appropriate role for the court itself. Not surprisingly, the court took garbage in, and spit garbage back out.In this light, the court's refusal to look at either the lengthy Palestinian campaign of terror which has resulted in nearly 1,000 Israeli deaths, or at the actual and ongoing contribution that the fence has already made to stopping Palestinian suicide bombers, is entirely predictable. It also smacks of casual anti-Semitism. When the deaths of hundreds of Jews is of no interest, and condemnation is ready only for non-violent self-defense measures, more than a hint of a double standard is detectable.Again, Mr. Speaker, I do support the resolution, and I believe it is vital that the House speak strongly and clearly about this recent travesty. I urge Members to vote in favor of the resolution and to make clear their strong and unshakeable support for the one true democracy in the Middle East, the State of Israel.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Last year, Mr. Chairman, President Bush announced a 5-year, $3 billion aid package for Pakistan in return for Pakistan's continued cooperation in the global war on terrorism. At that time, the President, through his spokesman, said that Congress would be looking closely at Pakistan's efforts on nuclear nonproliferation, on combating al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and other terrorist groups, and the reestablishment of democracy.Without question, Pakistani cooperation in the war on terrorism will be key to our success. Yet since the President's announcement, the media has been filled with reports of Pakistan's A.Q. Khan's nuclear network, where it turns out two-thirds of the axis got their nuclear technology and that Khan's agents tried to sell it to the other third.In addition, there have been recent reports of uneven cooperation from Pakistan with regard to terrorism generally, and al-Qaeda in particular. These reports reach to the very heart of the administration's justification for supporting Pakistan.Lastly, I do not think anyone can credibly say that the so-called referendum on General Musharraf's rule, or the parliamentary elections held last year, were either fair or free. Real democratization in Pakistan just does not seem to be high on General Musharraf's list, and we must do much more than to pretend it is high on ours.My amendment would require the Director of Central Intelligence to issue a classified, that is classified report to the appropriate committees of Congress regarding, one, the efforts of any Pakistani entity or individuals to acquire or transfer weapons of mass destruction and related technologies or missile equipment and technology to any other nation, entity, or individual; two, Pakistan's efforts to curb proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them; three, Pakistani steps to ensure that their own nuclear weapons are secure; four, Pakistani efforts to dismantle terrorist networks operating inside Pakistan, including but not limited to al-Qaeda and the Taliban; and, finally, five, Pakistani steps to restore democracy.The point, Mr. Chairman, of my amendment, is to help Members establish, on a classified basis, some of the facts about Pakistan's efforts and cooperation on all of these subjects. We will all be asked to support substantial military and economic assistance to Pakistan over the next several years, and I strongly support that proposition, but I believe that Members should understand the whole picture as they are being asked to approve this substantial assistance.While I understand that executive agencies generally do not like reporting requirements, we are a coequal part of government, and we have to learn the facts and the truth, we have to authorize and appropriate the money, and we must be informed. I have personally, as well as others have personally, tried to get the information from the administration, particularly regarding A.Q. Khan, and those efforts have been rebuffed.I do not believe my amendment would be unduly burdensome to the CIA, since they are supposed to be following the events in Pakistan anyway. I am merely asking that they put their information into some useful form for Members.Mr. Chairman, the administration has said repeatedly and properly that weapons of mass destruction and the possibility that they may be acquired by terrorists is the single biggest threat facing the United States, and in Pakistan, we have the epicenter of both of those threats. Our relationship with Pakistan is a complicated one and presents the United States with one of its most difficult near-term foreign policy challenges. I think the Members must make intelligent decisions regarding Pakistan, and we should have as much information on a classified basis as possible.Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to support the amendment.Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, times have sure changed since this appropriations bill was last presented to this Congress. We were a country free of mad cow disease and I was trying to pass an amendment requiring that no funds from the bill be used to allow downed animals into our food supply. I stood before this Congress and said: Let us do everything we can to make sure that mad cow disease never enters this country. Let us take precautionary measures and prevent downed animals--livestock too sick to walk or stand--from entering our food supply and require those animals to be humanely euthanized.This year, we are no longer a country free of mad cow disease and the USDA has since wisely implemented a series of interim final rules to strengthen food safety regulations in the United States. I applaud the USDA and FDA for their recent actions to strengthen safeguards against mad cow disease. I was pleased to read about recent regulations to remove highly infectious cattle materials from food, dietary supplementals and cosmetics. Though these regulations should have been in place years ago, I am thrilled to see that the USDA and FDA have embraced common sense policies to protect Americans.In good faith that the USDA will continue to enact sound policies to strengthen food safety laws and protect cattle from inhumane treatment, I will not be introducing my amendment again this year. As the USDA reviews the 22,000 public comments regarding their interim ban on downed animals, I urge the Department to consider the overwhelming number of comments--over 99 percent--that are strongly in favor of the ban.Mr. Chairman, I would also like to take this opportunity to assure fellow Members in this House, that any attempts to weaken or destroy the ban, will be met with the fury and resistance of the American people, who have overwhelmingly expressed their strong voice for a permanent downer ban. Let the record reflect that we fully expect that the final downer rule will be as strong, if not stronger, than the interim final rule. Tainted meat from sick animals has no business with American families. Let us not wait until the first case of the human form of mad cow disease is confirmed before taking actions to ensure the safety of our meat. Let us continue to work with the USDA and FDA to implement policies so we never ever have to see an American fall victim to mad cow disease.The CHAIRMAN. Under the rule, the Committee rises.Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Ose) having assumed the chair, Mr. Bass, Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4766) making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005, and for other purposes, pursuant to House Resolution 710, he reported the bill back to the House with sundry amendments adopted by the Committee of the Whole.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution expressing support and condolences to the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in South and Southeast Asia. I also want to commend Chairman Hyde and Ranking Member Lantos for their leadership on the resolution.Mr. Speaker, the people of South and Southeast Asia are faced with a natural disaster of an unprecedented scale. Over 150,000 people are dead and the World Health Organization estimates that between 3 and 5 million people are lacking basic survival requirements. Unfortunately, these numbers seem to rise with each passing day. Our condolences and prayers go out to all of those who have been affected by this deeply personal tragedy. But beyond our prayers, the people affected will need the assistance of the international community to prevent the outbreak of disease which threatens to take as many lives as the tsunami.The humanitarian response by the affected governments, the United Nations, and NGOs working in the region has been impressive in the face of tremendous need and daunting logistics. The outpouring of private contributions from all over the world should reaffirm our faith in humanity. But the magnitude of the need will remain long after the initial humanitarian response has provided people with shelter, food, clean water, and medical care.The $2 billion already pledged by the United States and other donors is an excellent down-payment, but I think we are only beginning to glimpse the massive undertaking that reconstruction will be. I hope that the House will rapidly consider the legislation that Chairman Hyde and Mr. Lantos are working on to provide substantial emergency assistance to the affected survivors, to help them rebuild their homes and their lives.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution and to commit themselves to supporting the additional relief we can certainly expect to be necessary.",

On January 9, the world witnessed the peaceful expression of Palestinian national aspirations. By holding the freest and fairest elections in the Arab world, it is clear that the Palestinian people, like any people, want to choose their own destiny.I hope, we all hope, that the election of Mahmoud Abbas as President of the Palestinian Authority opens a new chapter in the pursuit of Middle East peace. But as history has taught us, hope in the Middle East can be fleeting, and so our hope is accompanied by trepidation. We hope that this election will mark the beginning of a new relationship between Israelis and Palestinians, that this change in Palestinian leadership will enable the Palestinian Authority to take the courageous steps required to achieve peace that we have long argued were necessary. We hope that the change in Palestinian government will be recognized by Israel as an opportunity to achieve for themselves the secure Jewish, democratic state that has been their goal since independence. We hope that our own government sees the opportunity to again pick up the mantle of peacemaker, and support both parties in the struggle to achieve the vision of two states, living side by side, in peace, articulated by the President in his speech 2\\1/2\\ years ago.But there is much work to be done. President Abbas faces many challenges but first, foremost and absolutely, he has to stop terror and the potential for its resumption. Without this step all the other necessary reforms will be for naught. To achieve this President Abbas must reform Palestinian security services; end incitement against Israel; and deliver a government free of corruption and capable of producing the economic growth and prosperity the Palestinian people are entitled to expect. The United States can, and should, help here. I am pleased that the supplemental that we will consider in the coming weeks will have additional assistance for the Palestinian people. Now is the time for U.S. leadership in support of Abu Mazen's efforts to fight terror, reform his security services, and eliminate corruption. In the coming weeks and months we will have time to judge his efforts, but bearing in mind the potential for failure, now is the time to act in pursuit of peace.Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not say a word commending Israel for facilitating the recent elections. Prime Minister Sharon assured me, when I was in Jerusalem last November that he would do everything possible to ensure that Palestinians could vote, and he did. That is the kind of leader he is, and he deserves our support and our trust.Mr. Speaker, it is not yet a new day and we have not yet ``turned the corner.'' But I am certain we will be condemned by future generations if we do not do all we can to seize this moment and the opportunity it represents. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution but more importantly to remember that in the coming months we will be asked to take additional risks for peace. We should take them.",

Darnell was born before the doctor arrived at his parents' home on February 4, 1905. From nearly that day forward, Rev. Darnell has dedicated his life to helping others. He graduated from Hanover College in 1928, and went on to study at the Union Theological Seminary, receiving his Master of Divinity Studies in 1931.Shortly after completing his education and being ordained by the Presbyterian Church, Rev. Darnell joined The Community Church of Little Neck as a Pastor. During his 53-plus year tenure with the Church, Rev. Darnell oversaw tremendous growth in the congregation's membership and a considerable expansion of the church facilities. Upon his retirement, Rev. Darnell was named Pastor Emeritus of The Community Church of Little Neck, and he continued his faithful service to Little Neck and the surrounding communities by performing weddings, baptisms, funerals, and supplying pulpits until the age of 95.In addition to his church service, Rev. Darnell has received numerous awards and accolades. He helped found the Great Neck Clergy Association to fight anti-Semitism and promote brotherhood, tolerance, and understanding among the different religious traditions represented in the community. Rev. Darnell also served as the Director and Trustee of the New York State Christian Endeavor Union Summer Assemblies, as a commissioner to the General Assembly of The United Presbyterian Church, and on various committees of the New York City Presbytery.Local and family values have always been of the utmost importance to Rev. Darnell. He and his wife, Dorothy, celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary this past September, together with their three children, seven grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.Mr. Speaker, I commend The Reverend Warren E. Darnell for his 75 years of dedicated service to his community. As a pastor, community leader, husband, and father, Rev. Darnell has contributed much to the great many lives he has touched. In recognition of this, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to please join me in honoring The Reverend Warren E. Darnell as he celebrates his 100th birthday.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Peace Corps and to celebrate National Peace Corps Week, which ran from February 28 to March 6, 2005.Last week, we honored Peace Corps Volunteers for their dedicated work in promoting world peace and friendship across the globe. In an era where global interdependence and camaraderie has become increasingly important, the Peace Corps plays an integral role in connecting individuals from different countries, races, and creeds.Since the inception of the Peace Corps on March 1, 1961, over 178,000 volunteers have served in 138 countries. Currently, there are more than 7,700 Peace Corps volunteers serving in 72 countries around the world--the highest number of volunteers in the field in the past 29 years. Peace Corps volunteers are quite a diverse group, serving as teachers, information technology consultants, youth and agriculture workers, health and HIV/AIDS educators, and business advisors.I am proud to say that the 5th Congressional District of New York currently has 12 of its own as Peace Corps volunteers. They are, in alphabetical order and followed by the countries in which they serve: Kimberly A. Beers, Dominican Republic; Ling-Yun Chen, Turkmenistan; Michael E. Garris, Armenia; Seth B. Gazes, EI Salvador; Melissa Gonzalez, Costa Rica; Orlando Gonzalez, Costa Rica; Amy Y. Han, Uzbekistan; Grace E. Lee, Madagascar; Pei-Zei Lin, Burkina Faso; Erin C. McNally, Turkmenistan; Richard Z. Mo, Paraguay; Debbie Nip, Moldova.Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to please join me in honoring all of the past and present Peace Corps volunteers who selflessly serve abroad, empowering individuals in developing countries and spreading their message of world peace and friendship. These fine men and women have committed years of their lives to helping total strangers and to making our world a better and friendlier place. We salute your unselfish acts.",

    "title": "CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, late last year, the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress took a very destabilizing action when it voted to submit an ``Anti-Secession Law'' to the full Congress, which convened on March 5. That Anti-Secession Law was subsequently adopted by the full Congress and is now Chinese law.There can be absolutely no doubt about the intent of this law, which is to create the legal justification for a military attack against Taiwan.The law spells out a range of activities which, if taken by the Taiwanese people and their democratically elected leaders, would legally constitute secession to the Chinese. Many of these activities, such as Constitutional reform and popular referenda, are the mainstay of any democracy. Yet the Chinese would use them as an excuse for a military attack on the 21 million people on Taiwan.The United States fully understands Taiwan is in a very difficult bind. It is a flourishing democracy, one of the most vibrant in Asia, with freedoms of speech, the press and assembly and intensely competitive free political parties. Yet it is claimed as a sovereign territory by the People's Republic of China, which is not a democracy and has no freedom of the press, speech or assembly. And this neighbor now threatens to annex Taiwan by force.Under the terms of the Taiwan Relations Act, which is the legal bedrock of our policy, the United States insists that the future of Taiwan must be determined by peaceful means. And we have stated that no actions should be taken by either Taiwan or the People's Republic of China, that endanger the peace and stability that now exists across the Taiwan Strait.Mr. Speaker, during the past year, the Bush Administration cautioned Taiwan about actions which might appear to challenge this status quo. Now the PRC, through this provocative legislation, is challenging the status quo in a very big way. The State Department said this legislation is highly unhelpful. I strongly agree with this position and register my strong opposition to the enactment of the Anti-Secession Law.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join millions of Greeks and Greek-Americans in celebration of the 184th anniversary of Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire.Through it was 184 years ago this day that the Greek people fought for their unquestioned freedom, the Greek tradition of liberty and self-governance extends back thousands of years. The city-states of that storied peninsula were truly the forefathers of our democratic lineage. Our own founders drew upon the teachings and experiences of the ancient Greeks in their pursuit of individual freedom.There is no area of human thought that does not pay homage to the enduring contributions of Greece. Our greatest masters of mathematics, literature, science, art, architecture, theatre and philosophy all trace their intellectual heritage through its people. It is without question that the ancient Greeks were responsible for bringing light on what was an otherwise dark world.In two centuries, we have watched as a new democracy has been reforged where the very idea of democracy was born. The Greek people have also helped build America as well. Greek-American communities continue to add to the richness and tradition of many of America's cities, not least of all, in my own district in New York City. Our shared values of freedom and individual excellence have made Greek-Americans an important part of the quilt of American society.Mr. Speaker, on this occasion in which we celebrate Greeks independence, let us all remember the great debt we owe to the civilization that has given so much of itself to become the foundation of all democracies. By carrying on the great tradition of democracy, let us remember and honor the legacy of ancient Greece, as we stand with our Greek friends and allies of today.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join the Benjamin family of Glen Head, New York in celebration of the 50th birthday of Mrs. Deborah Benjamin, which will be commemorated this Saturday, June 25th, 2005 at Gotham Hall in Manhattan.Deborah Ann Coyle Benjamin was born on June 28, 1955, in Peninsula Hospital in Rockaway Beach, New York. Deborah is the eldest of Ken and Gladys Coyle's three children. Her sister, Denise DeVita, and brother, Ken Coyle, Jr., both live on Long Island in New York.Deborah spent her childhood and early adulthood in Rockville Centre, New York, where she attended Hewitt Grammar School, and graduated from South Side High School. After high school she attended Elizabeth Seton College in Westchester, New York.In the years after college, Deborah worked for her father's insurance company, the Wheatley Agency, for 20 years and retired in 2000 as Vice President of Group Insurance Sales.In 2000, Deborah married her long-time best friend, Alvin Benjamin of Glen Head, New York. Alvin is the Owner/President of Benjamin Development in Garden City, New York. They currently reside in Glen Head, Manhattan, and Highland Beach, Florida.Since her retirement, Mrs. Benjamin has devoted much of her time to charitable organizations dedicated to improving the lives of children. She is most actively involved with the Fanconi Anemia Research Fund, which is dedicated to finding a cure for this rare, but serious blood disease. Additionally, Mrs. Benjamin has lent her support to Palm Beach County-based Kids In New Directions, which assists children in making positive life choices and developing leadership skills. Countless children in New York, Florida, and throughout our nation have benefited from Deborah Benjamin's philanthropy and her generosity of time and spirt.Al and Deborah Benjamin enjoy spending time with their families, friends, traveling, giving to charities in the New York and Florida area, and remain lovingly devoted to one another after 5 years of marriage.Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Representatives to join me now in thanking Deborah Benjamin for her selfless contributions to society, in congratulating her on her 50th birthday, and in extending our best wishes for her future success and happiness as she marks this important and joyous milestone.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I love our flag and that for which it stands. It stands for a Nation founded by people fleeing from oppressors. It stands for freedoms, not the least of which is the freedom of opinion and the unimpeded expression thereof, including the freedom to protest. This was a Nation founded by protesters.When our Founding Fathers sought to guarantee these freedoms, they created not a flag, but a Constitution, debating the meaning of each and every word, every amendment of the Bill of Rights, each and every one of which gives people rights. They did not debate a flag. The flag would become a symbol of these rights.What is the threat to the Republic today that drives us to dilute the Bill of Rights? Well, someone burned the flag once this year. Whatever happened to fighting to the death for somebody's right to disagree?We now choose instead to react by taking away a form of protest. Most people abhor flag burners; but even a despicable, low-life malcontent has a right to disagree and to disagree in an obnoxious fashion. That is the true test of free expression.Flag burners are rare, but vile, acts of desecration that have been cited by those who would propose changing our founding document, but these acts do not harm anybody. If a jerk burns a flag, America is not threatened. If a jerk burns a flag, democracy is not under siege. If a jerk burns a flag, freedom is not at risk. We are offended. To change our Bill of Rights because someone offends us is, in itself, unconscionable.Who bans flag burning? Hitler did. Mussolini did. Saddam Hussein did. Dictators fear flag burners. The reason our flag is different is because it stands for burning the flag.Though we in proper suits may decry the protesters and the flag burners, protecting their right is the stuff of democracy. The real threat to our society is not the occasional burning of a flag, but the permanent banning of the burners. The real threat is that some of us have now mistaken the flag for a religious icon to be worshipped as would pagans, rather than to be kept as a beloved symbol of our freedom that is to be cherished.It is not the flag burners who threaten democracy. Rather, it is those who would deny them.The Constitution this week is being nibbled to death by small men with press secretaries. If the flag burners offend us, do not beat a cowardly retreat by rushing to ban them. Meet their ideas with bigger ideas, for an even better America to protect the flag by protecting democracy, not by retreating from it.The choice today is substance or symbolism. We cannot kill a flag. It is a symbol; and, yes, patriots have died, but they have died for liberty. They have died for democracy. They have died for the right of the protestors. They died for values.The flag is a symbol of those values. Saying that people died for the flag is symbolic language. What they really died for are American principles. The Constitution gives us our rights. The Constitution guarantees our liberties. The Constitution embodies our freedoms. It is our substance. The flag is the symbol for which it stands.True patriots choose substance over symbolism. Diminish the Constitution by removing but one right and the flag shall forever stand for less. Do not pass this amendment. Do not diminish the Constitution. Do not cheapen our flag.",

That flag represents our Constitution, and that Constitution is what makes the difference between us and others.It is not a flag because it is a different shape or has different colors. It is what it represents, and for the gentleman to stand up and cite why we are against doing this and citing history, we have laws against, as the gentleman from Florida said, public urination or nudity in public. Those laws, could the gentleman tell me where there is a constitutional amendment to ban that? There is none. We take care of that with other laws.In the history which the gentleman is so fond of citing in this country, never has there been a case where we amended the Founding Fathers' Bill of Rights.

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, the Department of State pays for services to protect foreign missions and officials in the U.S. In New York City, the city lays out the money and gets reimbursed. Under this program, it is the New York City Police Department that protects foreign missions and officials, including meetings at the United Nations such as the General Assembly.Over the past several years, Congress has authorized and appropriated approximately $10 million per year for this program. However, the cost of providing these services has increased substantially, as we can imagine, since September 11, 2001, while the authorizing appropriated level for the program has remained the same. This has led to an accumulation of State Department debt which was approved but remains unpaid to the City of New York.While New York is not the only city where such services are called for by the State Department, Los Angeles and Chicago occasionally, among others, provide these services as well, New York is the only city owed money by the State Department.The amendment raises the authorized level for the program to $15 million in each year for fiscal years 2006 and 2007, and also authorizes the State Department to pay $19.58 million in back payments for expenses incurred since 2002.Mr. Chairman, in New York City the State Department has found a flexible and consistent partner willing to front the money as well as a cost-effective solution to address an important security concern when leaders from around the world gather at the United Nations or elsewhere in New York. The least we can do is authorize the program at a level that allows the State Department to pay its bills in a timely way.I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman Hyde) and the ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), for their support and cooperation and leadership and help, and to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. King), who is the cosponsor of this amendment, for his great work in solving and resolving the issue.I urge all of our colleagues to support the amendment.Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I certainly believe that the United States needs to be vigilant in protecting our nation and combating terror; however, we must be careful that we do not unnecessarily sacrifice our civil liberties in pursuit of our enemies.While many of the provisions were needed, both then and now, when Congress passed the original PATRIOT Act in October 2001, we rightfully placed sunset clauses on certain provisions that infringed on our civil liberties and granted extraordinary powers to federal authorities. These sunset clauses were incorporated in order to provide us with the opportunity to reexamine and reevaluate whether the need for such invasive powers continues to outweigh their sometimes overly intrusive nature.Rather than providing Congress with the opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of a measure and correct any abuses, the PATRIOT Act Reauthorization would renew two of the original sunset provisions for a period of ten years and make the rest of the temporary provisions permanent. This would effectively remove all Congressional oversight over the PATRIOT Act. As a result, Americans would forever forfeit some of their most cherished privacy rights and precious civil liberties.One of these provisions gives federal investigators authority to examine and access individual records at libraries and bookstores. Under this measure, federal authorities do not have to demonstrate probable cause of criminal activity or of an individual's connection to a foreign power. In addition, libraries and bookstores are prohibited from informing patrons that the government is monitoring their reading transactions. While there is broad bipartisan opposition to this provision, the Republican leadership, in a gross abuse of the democratic process, failed to allow even a vote on an amendment that would repeal this egregious provision.Measures like this are not going to help us prevail in the war against terrorism. Instead, we should be providing our law enforcement agencies with sufficient risk-based funding, so that they can be adequately equipped to protect our homeland. Yet, the Bush administration continues to cut funding for state and local law enforcement, the men and women in our communities who serve on the front lines of domestic security.I too am committed to keeping our nation safe while we are fighting the war on terror. But at the same time, it is just as imperative that we protect our constitutionally guaranteed civil rights. A free society is what makes our nation great, and now, more than ever, it is crucial that we protect our civil liberties with unshakable resolve.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Pearl Schenkler, a rare and special woman on the occasion of her 90th birthday.Pearl was born in 1915 in New York City to immigrant parents. The second of four daughters in a family that truly lived the American dream, Pearl learned from the example of her parents. Her father, a steelworker, and her mother, a homemaker, unique in their commitment to education, insisted on sending each of their four daughters to college. Inspired by her two younger sisters, Pearl graduated college and became a teacher in the New York Public School System. Pearl spent the first part of her career teaching the second grade in P.S. 221 in Harlem and finished her remarkable career of service not far from my childhood home at P.S. 154 in Queens.Her commitment to teaching and molding her students was second only to her efforts in raising a strong family. Pearl and her husband Max were married for more than 50 years. He, too, was an educator and together they taught and learned. Their two children, my friends Carole Jacobson and Michael Schenkler, are illustrations of how the important values that weave the fabric of our city have been nurtured by children of immigrant parents and shared with the next generation. Pearl Schenkler gave her children the same meaningful start her parents gave to her.Carole and Michael and their many cousins, all of whom I have the pleasure of knowing, are part of the wonderful story of our great country. Pearl Schenkler, her parents, her husband, her sisters and brothers-in-law helped to build my home borough of Queens into a beacon of learning and understanding. In 1954, Pearl and Max moved their family from the Bronx to Kew Gardens Hills. Soon, Pearl's parents and eventually all her siblings called that neighborhood their home. The borough of Queens, New York was the beneficiary of the talent, knowledge and kindness the family shared with their neighbors and the greater community.In one of the great tradition of those before them, Pearl and Max, like so many other New Yorkers, eventually retired to Florida, where Pearl quickly took to working for others and joined the Boca Chapter of B'nai B'rith Women. She became the editor of the Boca Raton Clarion, the organization's newspaper, winning nationwide awards for the best publication from some four hundred chapters of B'nai B'rith. Pearl began spending countless hours helping local children who were sick or in need, as well as helping to fund the construction of a hospital in Israel. She then moved on to become President and led the Boca Raton Chapter for a number of years. Even with all of these selfless responsibilities, Pearl and Max still made time for family. They visited New York often and their kids and grandkids were frequent guests in Boca. During his later years, Pearl spent much of her time caring for Max, her life companion who passed away after a wonderful and fulfilling life at the age of 93. Mr. Speaker, as Pearl looks back and treasures her memories of 90 wonderful years, she will continue to be flanked by family. On October 8, 2005, her 90th birthday, her children and grandchildren will be with her in Florida to celebrate this momentous occasion.Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to please rise and join me in congratulating my friend Pearl Schenkler and sending her our very best wishes for a very happy 90th birthday.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Madam Speaker, first, let me assure the gentlewoman from Virginia that I know she comes to the floor with a pure heart and with every good intention. Let me also assure her that I am not the Grinch that stole the Christmas tree ornaments.That being said, I really do not understand what we are doing today. I do not understand why we need to set up a straw man just to knock it down, to protect the symbols of Christmas as if they were under attack. Is this another war we fight for reasons that do not exist?There are people around who need an enemy at all times to try to separate us one from the other as Americans in order to advance their own agenda. I do not think we should be playing into their hands. Nobody is attacking Christmas or its symbols. I enjoy Christmas, sing Christmas carols. I do not celebrate the religious significance of it, but it is a holiday I tremendously respect, as I do my Christian friends, and do wish them a Merry Christmas. But that is not the point.What we are doing here is we are selling the American people sizzle and providing no steak. We are choosing symbolism over substance, and we are not providing substance, which is why I think most of us came to the Congress of the United States, not to protect symbols, but to protect everybody's rights.Now, I know when people want to be inclusive they come to the floor and they are very inclusive. I get included in when you want to talk about Judeo-Christian traditions or heritage.When you want my participation, you know how to do it. But I am offended by this. You have drawn me out. Why not protect my symbols? My symbols are not protected here. And I am not asking them to be because if you came to the floor protecting my symbols and nobody else's, I would say, no thank you. Do not protect me unless you protect everybody because that is the American way. We are doing symbols over substance. We have embarked on a very slippery slope, the incline of which might be too steep. We do not know the unintended consequences.I like Christmas. I like the message of Christmas. I like helping the needy and the poor and the least among us. But I did not come here to protect the symbols.Did something happen when I was not looking? Did somebody mug Santa Claus? Is somebody engaging in elf tossing? Did somebody shoot Bambi? If you eat venison, are you a suspect? What silliness we engage in, protecting symbols.If you wanted to protect the message of Christmas, come to the floor with real bills with substance. Where is your bill to house the homeless? Where is your bill to feed the needy? Where is your bill to clothe the naked? Where is your bill to protect senior citizens who will not be able to heat their homes this winter? Where is the substance? Why are we engaging, in this terrible time in which we are in, in symbolism?We can be doing something meaningful. Where is the bill for real health care? Where is the bill to educate the children that we really are leaving behind? We are not doing any of those things. I think we could be doing so much more instead of feeding the flames that divide us instead of bringing us together.I wish the gentlewoman a merry Christmas. I have no compunction about doing that. But I do not want my government to engage in the foolishness of deciding for people what their symbols should or have to be. And I know that it has been amended so that it now reads that this is for Christian people. I do not want to be here telling Christian people how to observe Christmas. I mean, I did not come here to protect toys and tinsel anymore than I came here to protect presents and potato latkes. This is not my deal. And we have important work to do that is important to real people of all faiths, and people of all faiths should not engage in anything that feeds those who would be divisive.I know that is not the intent of the gentlewoman, because I think I know her heart well. But this is the unintended consequence of bills such as this when we go down that path.Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

Nobody is attacking the symbols of Christmas. Are you objecting to our wanting to be included because the symbols of your religion are more important than the symbols of anybody else's religion in America?

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today is Yom Ha-Shoah, Holocaust Memorial Day, and I rise to honor the memory of the 6 million Jewish souls extinguished in the greatest act of organized depravity in history.There have been many barbaric regimes and there have been many other vicious campaigns of annihilation undertaken both before and after the Holocaust. Some even produced more victims. The Shoah, however, is unique and is thus deserving of special attention, not because the victims were Jews--many millions of innocent non-Jews were murdered by the Nazis--but because the Holocaust revealed a painful and abiding truth about humanity that remains with us. In squalor of the camps, in the ashes of the crematoria, and in the fires of the ovens, it was demonstrated that the norms of civilization, the boundaries of morality, and the protections of society and government are no more protection than a fragile tissue of behavior, one torn aside with shocking ease to reveal the latent bestiality in human beings.The imperative of Holocaust for us today, as legislators and participants in American government is the same for all Americans and, in truth, all humanity. That imperative is to remember. There are many reasons why: To remember all those people murdered for the crime of their birth and rededicate ourselves to preventing such a crime from being repeated. To remember that bigotry and ignorance can metastasize in politics with horrific consequences. To remember that whole communities can be wiped out with the power of the modern state and to recommit ourselves to the protection of the weak and powerless. To remember all those men and women and children who were cremated and dumped into mass graves, not just to end their lives, but to deny their very existence.But most of all we must remember because it can happen again.It is happening again. It is happening in Sudan. Right now. Today. Some 400,000 Sudanese have already been killed and, if today is a typical day, 500 more will join them as the world wrings its hands and wonders what to do. This lassitude, this fecklessness, this disgraceful toleration of genocide is nothing new either. We saw it when there was slaughter in Southeast Europe. And we saw it as a genocide was perpetrated with machetes in Rwanda. And even before the Holocaust, it happened to the Armenians and today we debate whether it ever happened at all.We must remember the Holocaust because genocide is real. It is not history, it is reality.Today, genocide is a reality in Sudan. Tomorrow, when Iran acquires nuclear weapons, will we see the mullahs attempt to finish Hitler's barbaric work? Impossible? Incomprehensible? Sophisticated people will ask, ``Who would harness the power of a modern state to the absurd goal of killing Jews? Who would risk their state over it?''We must remember. A world that doesn't keep Auschwitz fixed in its mind will see it rebuilt. We must remember.",

    "title": "SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution.First, let me thank Chairman Hyde and Ranking Member Lantos for bringing this matter to the floor.Yesterday, I read a news article quoting a Hamas representative who thanked the United States for providing Hamas with ``the weapon of democracy.'' The weapon of democracy. Like other Hamas spokesmen, this man was being completely frank. In my experience, people who think they are on a mission from God generally do not dissemble about their intentions. The decision by the Bush administration to press for elections that did not exclude Hamas, as the Oslo agreements required, is seen by Hamas, quite literally, as a gift from heaven. Indeed, it is a fact of surpassing strangeness that the same President who would not deal with Yasser Arafat because he was tainted by terrorism is in large measure responsible for insisting on the elections that brought Hamas to power.Allowing Hamas to compete was substantially our grave mistake. Electing Hamas, however, was the Palestinian people's own free choice. No one questions the mechanics of the election itself, only the nature of the elected. Let us recall that Hitler's National Socialists, the Nazi party, also came to power in free elections. References of this type are usually inappropriate. The Holocaust was a unique, horrible event, and nothing should ever be done to diminish it or turn it into another rhetorical cheap shot. But in this case the comparison of how coming to power was the same is very apt.What is Hamas? Hamas is declared to be, by our government and the European Union, a terrorist organization. It is an ally and an aid recipient of Iran. It is an organization of religious zealots who put bombs in stores and clubs and restaurants, hotels and discos and buses and proclaim their work to be the will of God. It is an organization that insistently proclaims its intention to exterminate the State of Israel and to replace it with an Islamic state under Sharia law. It is an organization that proudly declares its beliefs that Jews are the descendants of ``pigs and monkeys.'' Hamas is responsible not only for the cold-blooded murder of hundreds of Israeli citizens but also dozens of Americans.And while they may be crazy, they are not stupid. They are watching us very closely, and they are looking for any sign of weakness, any departure from principle, any signal of grudging acceptance. It is absolutely vital that they see nothing of the sort. When Hamas looks at America, at the administration, at the Congress, they must see nothing but fierce, unrelenting, and implacable rejection.There can be no political absolution for this pack of killers; and the very idea of giving our taxpayers' money to these bloody-handed fanatics, people who have slaughtered our own citizens, is offensive. Suggesting that we do it indirectly, that we merely subsidize rather than fund their rule, is no less unacceptable.People in the executive branch trying to figure out how to square this circle should pay close attention to this debate. I would say to them: Before you urge the President to ask the Congress to provide assistance to the Palestinians, you had better start counting votes. This Congress is more likely to restore British sovereignty over the United States than it is to appropriate even $1 for the West Bank or Gaza.Hamas is a terrorist organization, and the United States has clear policy for dealing with terrorists: We do not do it. We do not legitimize them, and we do not acknowledge phony distinctions between their political and their terrorist ``wings.'' We do not forgive them for the hundreds they have murdered in exchange for a handful of promises. And we certainly do not pay them. Not in cash, not in coupons, not in vouchers, not in green stamps, not in airline miles. Americans do not give money to terrorists, to terrorist governments, and to people who elect terrorists. We have better things to do with our money.When President Abbas was first elected, I was among those who were strongly encouraging the administration to boost his prestige and help build him up with assistance and projects. But he never demanded that Hamas and other terrorist groups disarm and disband. Now we see that after a year of trying things the way Abu Mazen wanted and not feeling they got any real benefits, Palestinians have voted to go in a different direction. That is their right. But it is absolutely critical that our policies adjust to reflect their decisions.Just as I believed that the Palestinian choice of Abu Mazen's vision of nonviolence and peace deserved our support and assistance, I think the election of Hamas, with its dogmatic adherence to terror and its insistence on Israel's extermination, deserves our strongest condemnation and is an unmistakable change in how we do business.Elected terrorists are still terrorists. We should not give them legitimacy. We should not deal with them diplomatically. And, most obviously, we should not give them hundreds of millions of dollars from our taxpayers. U.S. foreign assistance is a gift, not a right. The Palestinian Authority, as long as it is led by Hamas, is a terrorist organization responsible for the deaths of dozens of Americans and obviously disqualified from this kind of aid.Not doing business as usual means, by definition, that things have to change across the board. Only a comprehensive rejection of Hamas's leadership can satisfy the requirements of continued U.S. leadership in the war on terror. The message and the methods of Hamas must not only fail but they must be seen to fail throughout the world and especially in the Middle East.Compromising with Hamas and doing a little bit of business here, a little bit of business there, accepting phony commitments and using back-door intermediaries will prove to Islamic radicalists that there is no price they pay for terrorism as long as you succeed in taking the reins of power. We cannot afford to send that message to the Palestinians or to anybody else.I strongly encourage the adoption of this resolution and prompt consideration by the House of additional legislation to respond to the challenge to America and our interests that are posed by Hamas.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Rabbi Dr. H. Joseph Simckes, who has just retired after 29 years of service to the Hollis Hills Jewish Center.As the spiritual leader of the Hollis Hills Jewish Center, Rabbi Simckes' dedication and compassion to our community has been unparalleled. I have had the great honor of knowing this intelligent, wise and kind-hearted individual, both on a personal level and as an advocate for the numerous important issues, and, particularly, support for the state of Israel, that we have worked on together.Throughout his extraordinary career, Rabbi Simckes has been deeply and profoundly involved in the education of Jewish youth. His strong support of Jewish education was evident early in his career through his role in helping to found the first Solomon Schecter Day School in Boston. Rabbi Simckes has also led over 40 student-groups on tours throughout Israel. I have seen first hand the importance Rabbi Simckes places on education through the important work that he has done helping sculpt today's Jewish curriculum and the vast knowledge and rigor that he displays in his moving sermons. The wisdom he has shared both inside and outside of his congregation has improved and enriched the lives of thousands in the community.Rabbi Simckes is also a trained therapist, whose compassion and guidance have comforted both old and young. Rabbi Simckes has been a pillar of strength throughout his tenure counseling, comforting, and sharing in the pain and joy of the whole community.Rabbi Simckes has stood with the Queens Jewish Community during our most important life-cycle moments: births, bar-mitzvahs, weddings, and, of course, deaths as well. Always warm, always accessible, Rabbi Simckes has guided our community as pastor and friend.Our community has been blessed to have such a devoted and passionate leader. Though Rabbi Simckes will be missed his role as congressional rabbi, his spirit and convictions will remain as a permanent legacy for the community. The importance he placed on learning, and his deep devotion to the Jewish people and their faith, have inspired us all, and we look forward to his continued involvement in our lives.To Chana Simckes, on behalf of the entire community, I want to thank you for sharing your husband to us so readily and for so long. Without your love and support neither he, nor we, could have made it so far, and for so long, together.Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in the House to join me in recognizing my leader, my pastor, my guide, and my friend, Rabbi Dr. H. Joseph Simckes for his 29 years of service to the Hollis Hills Jewish Center. We send him our very best wishes in his years of well-earned retirement.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Rabbi David Wise, who in August began his tenure as Rabbi of the Hollis Hills Jewish Center.A native of Toronto, Ontario, Rabbi Wise grew up as an active member in the educational programs and youth groups of the Conservative movement. He continued his Judaic involvement at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, where he received a Masters degree and was ordained a Rabbi. Upon completion of his studies, Rabbi Wise began his rabbinical career at Temple Beth El in Somerset, New Jersey.Rabbi Wise is tremendously dedicated to his congregation and the surrounding Jewish community. For years, he has worked to help congregants read Torah, haftarah, and to increase their skills as prayer leaders. Rabbi Wise is also active in the synagogue's educational programs, encouraging both children and adults in their exploration of Judaism. With an open door and welcoming smile, Rabbi Wise serves as a friend and mentor to any congregant seeking guidance, as well as those who want to deepen their Jewish learning and commitment.Rabbi Wise plays many roles in promoting the growth of a strong Jewish community and this involvement has been a staple of his career. During his years in New Jersey, Rabbi Wise taught rabbinic literature in the upper-school of the Solomon Schechter Day School of Raritan Valley. An active Zionist, Rabbi Wise also led the first ever Beth El congregational trip to Israel. As the vice president for special programming of the New Jersey Rabbinical Assembly, Rabbi Wise helped organize a spiritual retreat to the Princeton Theological Seminary after the High Holiday Season. Rabbi Wise was also a member of the steering committee for Jewish LIFE, a cooperative body of synagogues and Jewish institutions striving to bring adult learning to the community.In addition to promoting Jewish education throughout New Jersey, Rabbi Wise has served on the boards of the Jewish Federation of Greater Middlesex County and Ramah Day Camp of Raritan Valley. Rabbi Wise also offered his services as a chaplain to the Franklin Township Police Department in New Jersey.On behalf of the entire community, I am delighted to welcome Rabbi Wise, his wife, Judy Krinitz, and their two children, Jordana Nechama and Elijah Mordechai to our part of the Big Apple. We look forward to many years of his spiritual leadership as our pastor and our friend. Together, we will continue our efforts to make the Queens Jewish Community a place that our children and families are proud to call our home.Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in the House to join me in welcoming and honoring the new spiritual leader of the Hollis Hills Jewish Center, a man of humor, knowledge, and wisdom, Rabbi David Wise. We send him our very best wishes.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. I rise in support of the Obey-Hyde-Lantos amendment.Mr. Chairman, in years past on this floor and in committee I have noted Egypt's central role in the Middle East peace efforts and that without those efforts we would have been even further away from peace than we are. That is, I believe, still true today. And clearly Egypt played an important part of Israel's successful disengagement from Gaza last year, but as central as the Egyptian role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is and as helpful as Egypt has been with ship transits through the Suez and flights over the Suez Canal in support of our efforts in Iraq, in regional peace and security, is not the only agenda that we have with Egypt.President Bush has called for democratic transformation as a response to the rise of Islamic extremists in the Arab world. In Egypt, the response to that call has been decidedly mixed. Clearly, last year's presidential elections which for the first time featured more than one candidate on the ballot were a departure from the past practice of an up or down vote on President Mubarak and were a positive step forward. However, the Egyptian parliamentarian elections in December were marred with violence, voter intimidation and allegations of fraud as the ruling party sought to hold not just its majority in the assembly but its overwhelming majority.While some will point out that a large number of opposition candidates who want seats, the real concern is that so many of them are affiliated with the Muslim brotherhood. No doubt the Egyptian government will look at these results and say again that political reform must proceed slowly.I would argue that these results are of the government's own making. It is not democratic reform that produced these results, but the lack of political space for legitimate secular parties to function within Egyptian society. By denying that space, by arresting judges and journalists, by prosecuting legitimate opposition political leaders, by beating demonstrators, by extending the emergency law, the government of Egypt makes more likely the political result that they most fear, a future government of Egypt dominated by radical Islamists.The choice we have today is to do nothing and hope that with more dialogue and a little more cajoling, that we can get President Mubarak to continue on the path to reform or we can send a clear message that even appreciating how helpful Egypt is on the regional peace and security issues, the Congress will not stand silently by as government thugs beat peaceful demonstrators in the streets of Cairo and with their fists extinguish the hope of a truly moderate, secular democratic future for Egypt.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, on behalf of myself, Mr. Waxman, Mr. Lantos, Mr. Engel and Ms. Wasserman Schultz, I'd like to express our shock and horror at the death of Alan Senitt in Washington, DC, early yesterday morning. Each of us came to know Alan as a staffer for Lord Greville Janner of Braunstone, United Kingdom. Lord Janner is a leader in European efforts to fight anti-Semitism and racism, and is the founding chairman of the International Council of Jewish Parliamentarians, an organization of which we are all members. Alan played a critical role in helping to bring this organization into existence.Alan was a kind, dedicated and good person, a young man with enormous potential and great hopes for trying to build a better world. Alan devoted himself to a life in politics and intercommunal dialogue because he understood that it is only by effort and commitment that the wounds of our world can be knit up.In a life of only 27 years, Alan was a dynamic student leader, an energetic voice for British Jewry and pro-Israel advocacy, a talented leader in the campaign against racism and bigotry, and a candidate for public office. The future he was so brutally denied would surely have been no less full of struggle, achievement and success.His death is a tragic loss for each of us, the Jewish community in the United Kingdom, his wide circle of friends and, most of all, his family.Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Senitt family: his parents, Karen and Jack, and his siblings, James and Emma, who have been so cruelly robbed of their son and brother. Alan leaves behind a legacy of compassion, vitality, good works and a vast potential tragically curtailed. He will be deeply missed.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution and thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.I want to thank Mr. Lantos for his leadership, along with Representative Leach for everything that he has done on this issue, and Congressman Wilson as well; and my cochair of the India Caucus, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for her great leadership, and I especially single out Mr. Crowley of New York for his role in bringing this resolution to the floor.Mr. Speaker, sadly on July 11, 2006, we have a date which will join the litany of the all-too-familiar terrorist attacks, along with the July bombings in London last year, the Madrid bombings in 2004, the Bali bombings in 2002, and, of course, the September 11 attacks on us.What is also sad is this is not the first time Mumbai has been attacked. In fact, Mumbai has suffered from terrorist attacks since 1993. Indeed, India itself has been the victim of various forms of terrorism since its founding.Last week's bombings are simply a continuation of India's ongoing struggle with terrorists. Eight bombs were planted by terrorists in the western commuter railway in Mumbai on July 11. Seven of them exploded. They were timed for the height of the rush hour, with the obvious premeditated intent to kill and maim as many innocent people as possible. The resulting explosions left as many as 200 innocent people dead and over 700 people wounded. The response by the authorities and the people of Mumbai to aid the wounded and comfort the families and friends was extraordinary.The bombings horrified decent people everywhere and were condemned by leaders from all over the globe, including the G-8.Terrorism is a disease. It is a cancer on the body of humanity, and all nations that oppose terrorism should work shoulder to shoulder to make sure that this scourge is not just cured, but eliminated. The Government of India has long recognized this truth, and in the wake of September 11, 2001, and its attacks on the United States, India was indeed the first nation to step forward and offer its assistance to our Nation.Let us do the same for India. Let us be prepared not just to offer our condolences and sympathy, but our renewed and reinvigorated commitment to defeating terrorism globally.I thank the Speaker, and I urge my colleagues to stand with India against terrorism and to support them and this resolution.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is an old photograph, tattered and torn. Its color is sepia, indicating that it is over 90 years old, and it hung on the wall in my mom's apartment. She would point it out to me when I was a little boy and say, ``This was your grandmother, who you never knew. It is a picture of their wedding.'' And the little children who sat in front of this wedding portrait were 5, 6, 7, 8 years old, a lot of little kids, and she said, pointing to one of them, ``This is my Aunt Rachel,'' and to another she said, ``This is my Uncle Joseph.''I was tiny. I didn't understand. I said, ``Mom, how can that be your aunt and uncle? They are only children.'' And she said, ``They will always be children.'' I didn't understand quite what she was getting at until I was quite a bit older.When World War II broke out, there were 1.6 million Jewish children throughout Europe. At the end of the Holocaust, that number became under 100,000. The Jewish people were almost eradicated from the face of the Earth by the people of the National Socialist Party of Germany, the Nazis, who were intent on wiping the Jews from the face of the Earth, claiming they had no right to live, no right to exist, in their country or anyplace else, and set out on a pogrom. They were nearly successful.Nobody came to the aid of the Jewish people. People were put in gas chambers, their bodies burnt in ovens by the millions throughout the world. Nobody came to their aid. Nobody cared. The annihilation of an entire people by people who were pure evil.It wasn't until the end of the war when the Jewish people and others who were in these concentration camps saw their first Americans and America's allies when they were liberated from those camps, alive because of happenstance and circumstance.Our good friend, Tom Lantos, and his wife, Annette, a distinguished moral force in our Congress, is alive today along with his wife as the beneficiary of a noble act of Christian charity by somebody who was a stranger. The luck of the draw.The Jewish people weren't even organized enough to fight. They weren't fighters. They didn't know any better. They had no country. They were scattered.The world looked at them at the end of the war and said we have to do something about this, and they took the area of Transjordan and they divided it and created the country of Jordan and the country of Israel, a Jewish state, so Jews could have a place to be where they could live safely within secure borders. And I know many things have happened and part of those borders are disputed today, but that is beside the point.Suddenly in this very day and age, what seems to be eons from the Nazis and that era, another people rise up and make claim to the world out loud, clearly and unambiguously, that the Jewish people have no right to be anywhere; that they will wipe them from the region, kill them, eradicate them, and drive them from the planet. No different than the Nazis.Now, those of my friends with such good intentions, and there are some here and I have spoken to them and I have listened to them, who talk about proportionality, who talk treating everybody equal, who talk about measured response, who talk about a cease-fire and going back to the status quo, they are well-intentioned, but I want them to look me in the eye and tell me what a proportional response means. How do you negotiate with somebody whose goal is your eradication? Take half my family? Kill every other one of us? What is there to negotiate? Do we tell the victim of a violent crime that they have no right to fight back as forcefully as they can? Do we tell the rape victim that she has no right to fight with all her strength against the accused rapist? Nonsense.We don't tell that to any other country. And there is only one Jewish state on the planet. Don't tell that to Israel. People of the Jewish faith and everybody else living in Israel have the right to exist, the same right as anybody else, and they have that right to respond. How can you deny that?Thank God Israel doesn't stand alone anymore. It has one good friend in this whole world, and that is this United States. And we are so thankful for that. I am very pleased with this resolution. It does have the right balance.Innocent people die in wars. Not every German was a Nazi, and yet we had to fight them because they represented the Nazis. They put them in power. They elected them in a democratic election. Elections have consequences. Just because you participate in an electoral process doesn't absolve of you of your crimes or your sins, especially if you rededicate yourself to them. That is what we are facing right now.I urge your serious consideration of this resolution and all that it implies. Justice demands no less.",

    "title": "UNITED STATES AND INDIA NUCLEAR COOPERATION PROMOTION ACT OF 2006",
    "text": "Mr. Chairman, today the House has an opportunity to make an historic choice of great proportions. For 30 years, Mr. Chairman, U.S. policy toward India has been defined and constrained by our insistence on punishing India for its sovereign decision not to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.The truth be told, had India conducted its nuclear tests earlier, it would have been treated the way we treat France and Britain and Russia and China and ourselves. In short, it would have been grandfathered in as a member of the nuclear weapons club. But they did not test earlier, and they have been treated differently. And nothing that we have tried over the last three decades has convinced them to give up their nuclear status, and nothing that we would say over the next three decades would convince them, either.The time has come for the United States to deal with the reality of South Asia as it is and not as a fanciful wish. India lives in a difficult neighborhood, next to Pakistan, which continues to produce nuclear weapons unchecked, and China, whose commitment to a fissile material cutoff is suspect, at best. If India didn't exist in that neighborhood, we would have to invent them.India has been a responsible nuclear power and deserves to be treated that way. The bill before us does just that.Critics have expressed concerns regarding the bill's impact on our nonproliferation policy; and, clearly Iran, Pakistan and North Korea are looking for clues as to what it means for them and their nuclear programs.What do you tell Pakistan and Iran and North Korea? Well, you tell them this: If you want to be treated like India, be like India. Be a responsible international actor with regard to weapons of mass destruction technologies. Don't sell your nuclear technologies to the highest bidder. Don't provide it to terrorists. Be a democracy, a real democracy like India, and work with us on important foreign policy objectives and not against us.Iran and North Korea signed the NPT and are now running away from their freely entered into obligation and away from IAEA inspections. India did not sign the NPT, and yet is embracing the IAEA and embracing global nonproliferation. India's attitude should be recognized and commended and congratulated.There are two options before us today: One, don't pass the bill. We do that, and we allow India to pursue its national interests unimpeded, as it has been doing outside of the nonproliferation mainstream.The other is to make a deal with India and give to the United States and the international community a window in perpetuity into two-thirds of India's nuclear facilities and all of its future nuclear facilities, under safeguards, in compliance, transparent.I think the choice is clear: If you want the IAEA to inspect India's civilian nuclear facilities, then you are for the bill. If you want India to be obligated to adhere to the missile technologies control regime for the first time, then you are for the bill. If you want them to comply for the first time with the nuclear suppliers' groups guidelines for the first time, then you are for the bill. If you want to send a clear message to nuclear rogue states about how to behave, then you are for the bill. And, if you want a broad, deep, and enduring strategic relationship with India, then you are for the bill.Mr. Chairman, it is time for a 21st century policy towards India, one that supports and encourages India's emergence as a global, responsible power and solidifies U.S.-India bilateral relations for decades to come. The bill before us today is that new policy. I urge our colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5682.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6033, a bill that would designate the United States Postal Service facility at 39-25 61st Street, in Woodside, Queens, New York City the ``Thomas J. Manton Post Office Building.'' It is more than fitting that a federal facility will be named after Tom in a community that he so ably represented for so many years.Tom lived a life seemingly from a movie script: a son of Irish immigrants; educated at St. John's University; earned his law degree at night from St. John's; Marine Corps Flight Navigator; New York City Police Officer; New York City Councilman from Queens; Member of Congress; and Queens County Democratic Chairman. Tom Manton's life was a perfect realization of the American Dream, and having achieved the American Dream himself, Tom always worked to ensure that everyone, native born and immigrant alike, had the opportunity to live the American Dream as well.When Tom Manton became Chairman of the Queens County Democratic organization, he immediately revitalized a local party beset by front-page problems and the loss of public trust. Tom turned the party organization around while at the same time insisting on increasing its diversity to reflect the borough of Queens. Tom recruited and helped numerous political candidates from different ethnic backgrounds. As a result of Tom's hard work, discipline, and commitment, the Queens Democratic Committee is currently one of the strongest party organizations in the country.In Congress, Tom was a tireless advocate for the people of New York. On the Committee on Energy and Commerce, Tom worked to help his constituents by bringing jobs and opportunity to his congressional district. Like many others, I turned to Tom for advice and guidance and found him to be a stand-up guy, the real deal. His word and handshake was his bond. Tom characteristically worked quietly behind the curtain, rather than grandstanding in front of the cameras. So, he might be a little embarrassed about having a federal facility named after him. But, Tom also believed in our government, and its ability to help each of us achieve our dreams of prosperity and justice for all Americans.Mr. Speaker, Tom Manton's life of hard work, perseverance, and selflessness brought integrity and dignity to public office. It is appropriate that we pay tribute to his memory by naming this post office in Woodside, Queens in his honor. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6033.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, which will help ensure that future generations of New Yorkers and all Americans will enjoy a clean, well-preserved Long Island Sound.The Long Island Sound is critically important to our Nation and vital to the health and well-being of the communities I represent. As an Estuary of National Significance, the Sound provides habitat for a wide array of plant and animal life, and contributes an estimated $5.5 billion to the regional economy from boating, fishing and tourism-related commerce. Boating and fishing are deeply enmeshed in the culture and traditions of Long Island, and the Sound has long been our region's gateway to the seas.Unfortunately, the effects of millions of people living adjacent to the Sound's shore have been profound. At the turn of the millennium, lobster catch rates plummeted by 90%, costing our local economy between $30 and $50 million. Dangerous levels of toxins continue to threaten the well-being of the Sound's diverse habitats and wildlife breeding areas, as well as the livelihoods of those who depend on these resources for their livelihood.The Long Island Sound Stewardship Act supplements conservation and preservation efforts along the shoreline of Long Island and Connecticut, and authorizes $25 million in federal appropriations over the next 4 fiscal years.Mr. Speaker, this bill is not perfect. I strongly support and will continue to advocate for funding at the original proposed level of $40 million annually. Properly conceived, the legislation should include wetlands and underwater lands within the authority of the Long Island Sound Stewardship Initiative, which will be established by this legislation. Additionally, I strongly support fully funding conservation and preservation offshore via the Long Island Sound Restoration Act, which has fallen victim to the Majority's budget cuts.The Long Island Sound, however, is a national treasure and I believe that any preservation efforts to conserve any part of the Sound should be embraced. I do support this legislation and I would like to thank my colleague from New York, the co-chair of the Long Island Sound Caucus, Mr. Israel, for all of his efforts to bring this bill to the floor and to preserve the Long Island Sound.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of our troops in the field and the belief that the United States will ultimately prevail in the global war on terror and against this partisan, transparent, cynical, and divisive resolution.Mr. Speaker, what we are engaged in today is not a serious debate about the progress of the war in Iraq or alternatives to achieve the victory there that we all seek. If it were not a sham, Members would be able to offer amendments. We would be able to vote up and down on our future course in Iraq. What we have here, instead, is more unamendable, arrogant, Republican take-it-or-leave-it attitude.Mr. Speaker, our soldiers are fighting and dying, and the American people are spending hundreds of billions of dollars, and we are here patting ourselves on the back instead of doing effective oversight. This Republican Congress has abdicated that responsibility and continues to whitewash an incompetent, dysfunctional Republican administration.I would like to be clear, Mr. Speaker. Just because I am for oversight doesn't mean that I hate freedom. Just because I am for tracking how billions of dollars have been wasted and misspent or stolen doesn't mean I don't support our troops. And just because people question the competence of the President and his administration doesn't mean that they are not patriots.On the contrary, Mr. Speaker, I don't think you can be a patriot if you just rubber stamp, if you turn a blind eye and bury your head in the sand as war profiteers run off with the money needed to protect the troops and to reconstruct a broken country.Instead of discussing the difficult and costly work necessary to achieve that victory, our Republican friends have simply decided to move directly to this victory party and 10 hours of cheerleading. This resolution begins and ends declaring our ultimate victory against terrorists, and in between we sing our own praises. This is actually a prayer. Prayer is good. But what we need is a plan. All we are doing here is whistling past a growing graveyard.What is more notable about the resolution, Mr. Speaker, is what it doesn't say. There is no mention of the world class bait-and-switch lie that got us into this mess in the first place. No mention of the lie of the stockpiles of weapons that the Vice President swore were absolutely there. No mention about the lie that the stockpiles of weapons of which Secretary Rumsfeld knew the exact location. No mention of oil. No mention of the intelligence either.In fact, there is not even the words ``weapons of mass destruction.'' How can you have such a resolution without that? And Osama bin Laden. Not only can't we find him in the region but we can't even find his name hinted at in this resolution.The debate is a whitewash, and this resolution is a coverup. Vote against this charade. Vote against the premature victory party. Vote against this resolution and let us have a real debate about our policy options and our future course and involvement in Iraq.",

    "title": "DR. LEONARD PRICE STAVISKY POST OFFICE",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5923, a bill that would designate the United States Postal Service facility located at 29-50 Union Street in Flushing, New York, as the Dr. Leonard Price Stavisky Post Office. It is more than fitting that a Federal facility be named after Leonard in a community that he so ably represented for so many years; and I note for the record that the bill is cosponsored by every Member of the New York State delegation, both sides of the aisle.Leonard was born in the Bronx and graduated from City College of New York in 1945. He continued his studies by earning a Master of Arts degree from Columbia University in 1946. He capped off his education with a doctorate in American History from Columbia in 1958.Leonard had a long and illustrious first career in academia, spending more than 30 years working and teaching at Colombia University, the State University of New York, the City University of New York, Colgate University, Long Island University, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. He taught history and political science and worked at the administration level as well.Until 1990, Leonard was an adjunct professor of political science at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs. His extensive background in education enabled him to be a strong and effective advocate and expert on education issues during his legislative career.Leonard earned his political stripes while serving on the New York City Council from 1954 to 1960. He was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1966, served as chairman of the Education Committee for more than 8 years. As chairman of the committee, he became an outspoken and passionate advocate of State support for public education.In 1975, Leonard sponsored the legislation that prevented severe budget cuts in New York City's public schools in the wake of the city's severe financial crisis.Leonard became my successor in the New York State Senate; and there he continued his fervent support of public education, including pushing for fiscal autonomy for the State University of New York.At the national level, Leonard served as a commissioner on the Education Commission of the States and was chairman of the Education and Labor Committee of the National Conference of State Legislatures.In these capacities he was a tireless advocate for States on educational issues involving the Federal Government and school districts across the Nation.Mr. Speaker, most of all, Leonard passionately represented Flushing, New York, in the Borough of Queens during his time in the New York State assembly and senate until his untimely death in 1999. He was active in all phases of community affairs, especially in Flushing. He served on the boards of directors of the Bay Community Volunteer Ambulance Corp., the Latimer Gardens Community Center, the Bland Houses Community Center, the Dwarf-Giraffe Boys League, the Flushing Boys Club, and the North Flushing Senior Center.In addition, he worked closely with the Mitchell-Linden Civic Association on numerous local issues. The members of this association have sought to honor Senator Stavisky by renaming the post office in their community after him. Dr. Stavisky could have comfortably stayed on in the academic field his entire career. Rather, he chose to selflessly participate in the political process in order to effectuate the policies he thought necessary to further public education.I would like to note, Mr. Speaker, that Leonard's wife, Toby, is carrying on Leonard's work, elected in her own right as the senator from New York's 16th State senate district, succeeding Leonard after his passing. Toby is the first woman elected to the State senate from Queens County. Leonard and Toby's son, Evan, is a prominent political consultant in New York.Mr. Speaker, Leonard Price Stavisky's life of hard work, perseverance, and selflessness brought integrity and dignity to public office. It is appropriate to pay tribute to his memory by renaming this post office in Flushing, Queens in his honor. I sincerely hope the whole House will join us in commemorating his decades of service to the people of Queens and to the city and State of New York, and I urge all to support H.R. 5923.",

    "title": "MOROCCO: A MODEL OF MUSLIM-JEWISH TIES",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I respectfully request that Serge Berdugo's recent op-ed, ``Morocco: A Model of Muslim-Jewish Ties'', as published in the January 9 issue of The Christian Science Monitor, be entered into the Congressional Record. Mr. Berdugo, the president of Morocco's Jewish Community Council, outlines the history of Muslim-Jewish relations in Morocco, where Jews and Muslims have peacefully lived as neighbors for hundreds of years. I commend this work to all who want a lasting peace between Jews and Muslims across the world, and everyone who wishes to see the State of Israel and its neighbors coexisting harmoniously.Casablanca, Morocco.--As the flames of anti-Semitism continue to be fanned across much of the Islamic world, there is a risk that today's youth will grow up believing that Arabs and Jews were simply not meant to coexist, let alone thrive together. That idea conflicts with history--and is a falsehood today. My country, Morocco, illustrates the viability and vitality of a Jewish community--my community--in an Arab country. It's a model of harmony other Muslim nations should follow. The Jewish people have been a presence in Africa's Maghreb region for more than 2,000 years. North African Jews and Muslims traveled north and thrived together in southern Europe for more than 700 years. In 1492, when we refused to convert to Christianity, we were expelled--together--from Spain. And together we successfully sought refuge in Morocco, which accepted us into its society and institutions. Morocco's leaders have always made the well-being of the Jewish people a top priority. During World War II, when the Vichy government of occupied France announced that it had prepared 200,000 yellow stars for the Jews of Morocco, King Mohammed V replied that he would need 50 more for him and his family. He refused to make any distinction between his citizens. The importance of a nation's leader setting the tone for recognition, respect, and treatment of minority faiths cannot be overstated. Today, King Mohammed VI has declared his religious, historical, and constitutional obligation to protect the rights, liberties, and sacred values of the Jews in Morocco. This commitment dramatically affected Morocco's reaction at moments of great challenge. After May 16, 2003--the Moroccan 9/11, when five terrorist bombs exploded, three directed at Jewish targets--King Mohammed VI expressed condolences at a Jewish Center, condemning the criminal acts and reaffirming his determination to protect Jews and all Moroccan citizens. In doing so, he defined the attack as one upon all Moroccan society, awakening the national conscience and strengthening the bonds between us. Moroccans of all faiths responded with candlelight vigils at bombing sites and demonstrations attended by nearly 1 million participants. Many Moroccan Jews have emigrated to Israel and elsewhere, but the attachments to our homeland are unique. ``Morocco never loses a Jewish citizen--we gain an ambassador,'' Mohammed VI's predecessor, King Hassan II, once said. Today, there are 1 million such ``ambassadors'' all over the world and 600,000 in Israel alone. We Jews who call Morocco home have a vibrant community that includes 30 functioning synagogues and three school networks, which many influential Muslim families choose for their own children. Moroccan Jews serve as counselors to the king, ministers, colonels, members of parliament, judges, and ambassadors. On Jewish holy days, Muslim authorities, out of respect, attend our services. With help from the Moroccan government, we started a foundation to preserve Jewish historical sites. And we support research on our community--including 30 doctoral dissertations presently under way by Muslim candidates. Are we an isolated society? Hardly: Moroccans young and old have access to as wide an array of media and ideological diversity as anywhere in the Islamic world. Yes, the extremists' call is heard here, too, but make no mistake--it's the response that differs. The tones of tolerance, trumpeted by a government that believes that Moroccan Judaism is an intrinsic and permanent part of the national culture, overwhelm the extremists' siren song. Are we a historical accident or the path forward? Perhaps the answer is that our historical good fortune now has to be transformed into a model for others. We are more relevant outside our border than ever before. Other world leaders must realize that the path forward lies not in fanning the fires of the moment, but in setting a tone of authentic coexistence that will endure.",

    "title": "STATEMENT RECOGNIZING FEBRUARY AS NATIONAL MARFAN AWARENESS MONTH",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in observance of February as National Marfan Awareness Month and to recognize the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are living with Marfan syndrome and related connective tissue disorders.I am proud that the Nation's premier organization supporting the Marfan syndrome community, the National Marfan Foundation, is headquartered in my congressional district in Port Washington, NY. The NMF was founded 25 years ago by Priscilla Ciccariello, a woman of enormous compassion and vision. For the past quarter-century, the NMF has been dedicated to saving lives and improving the quality-of-life for Marfan patients through research, support services, education, and advocacy.This year marks the 16th observance of National Marfan Awareness Month which is designed to educate the general public and healthcare providers about this challenging condition. Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue that can affect many body systems, including; the skeleton, eyes, heart, nervous system, lungs and blood vessels. Of primary concern to patients is the impact the syndrome can have on the aorta. In Marfan patients, the aorta (the large artery that carries blood away from the heart) is weakened and prone to enlargement and rupture, which is often fatal. Currently, there is no cure for Marfan syndrome but with early diagnosis, proper treatment and careful management, patients can live a normal lifespan.Madam Speaker, I am pleased to inform the House that we are at an unprecedented time of hope in the field of Marfan syndrome research. Just last month, the National, Heart, Lung and Blood Institute at the National Institute of Health, working closely with NMF, initiated a groundbreaking clinical trial on Marfan syndrome. This trial seeks to determine the efficacy of a medication currently used to control high-blood pressure for treating aortic growth in children with Marfan syndrome. The blood-pressure medication has shown a remarkable ability to halt and even reverse aortic growth in pioneering basic research conducted by Dr. Hal Dietz of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. I applaud NHLBI Director Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, and Dr. Gail Pearson, Chief of the NHLBI's Heart Development and Structural Diseases Branch, for their leadership in supporting this promising trial.Madam Speaker, February was chosen as National Marfan Awareness Month in part to coincide with Abraham Lincoln's birthday. President Lincoln is believed to have been affected by Marfan syndrome based on the many outward signs of the disorder he portrayed. Marfan syndrome patients are frequently taller than non-affected members of their family and have disproportionately long limbs, fingers and toes. In addition, they often have an indented or protruding chest-bone, curved spine, high-arched palate, and loose joints. Other well known individuals who were afflicted with the Marfan syndrome include Jonathan Larson, the Tony Award winning playwright of the Broadway musical Rent, Flo Hyman, captain of the U.S. Olympic volleyball team that won a gold medal in 1984, Charles de Gaulle, the composer Sergei Vasilievich Rachmaninoff, and Mary, Queen of Scots.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 14,000 people die each year of aortic aneurysms and dissections, 20 percent of which can be contributed to genetic disorders such as Marfan syndrome. Unfortunately, a lack of awareness about Marfan syndrome continues to result in patients dying before being properly diagnosed and treated. Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me and the National Marfan Foundation in raising awareness of this life-threatening disorder so we can prevent future unnecessary tragedies.",

Mr. BOUCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution, and I hope that its adoption by the House will send yet another powerful message that a change in the direction of our Iraq policy is required.Sending an additional 21,000 troops into Baghdad only serves to put more American forces in harm's way. The troop increase will not bring long-term stability, it will not halt the sectarian strife which has plunged Iraq into a civil war, it will do nothing to speed the day when U.S. forces can hand over the mission to the Iraqis and come home. But there is a better way.Our Virginia colleague Frank Wolf originated the formation of the commission that was chaired by former Secretary of State James Baker and by Lee Hamilton, who for years, with distinction, chaired the Foreign Relations Committee in this House. I commend Congressman Wolf for his foresight and for the public service that he provided to our Nation when he originated the formation of the Baker-Hamilton Commission. That commission was bipartisan. It was composed of our most experienced foreign policy experts, spanning administrations of both Republican and Democratic Presidencies. Its recommendations were unanimously presented by the members of the Commission. They embody the collective wisdom of these highly experienced Americans for the best course that our Nation can take for a new and more promising direction in Iraq.At the core of their proposals was a bold recommendation: that the United States begin a dialogue with Iraq's neighboring countries about a way to achieve regional stability and, most particularly, stability in Iraq.Iran, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia all have influence with the various warring factions in Iraq. Iran and Syria in particular have a strong interest in a more normal relationship with the United States. All of these countries have a long-term interest in a stable Iraq. The Baker-Hamilton Commission's direction for a U.S.-led negotiation among these nations is the only real option we have left in order to achieve under United States guidance a peaceful Iraq. President Bush has rejected this recommendation. He has acted, in my view, very unwisely.More United States troops are not the answer. Blind faith in the Iraqi Prime Minister with his ties to the Shia militia leader, al-Sadr, is not the answer. A military solution standing alone is not the answer. The only path to success lies in diplomacy and accepting the wise counsel of the Baker-Hamilton Commission.Finally, the administration decided to try real diplomacy in North Korea, and it is working. It is also the only hope we have for stability in Iraq.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 556, the National Security FIRST Act. I would like to thank the Chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. Frank, for his efforts in making this legislation one of the committee's first priorities. I would also like to commend my colleague from New York, Mrs. Maloney, for sponsoring this important legislation.Mr. Chairman, it's been a year since the Bush administration thought it would be a good idea to hand over commercial operations of six of our nation's ports to the government of Dubai--a country that the 9/11 Commission report named as a source of terrorist financing and which two of the 9/11 hijackers called home. We have since learned that, during the review process undertaken by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, administration officials did not perform a required thorough investigation of the deal to a satisfactory level and chose not to require Dubai Ports World to follow certain security conditions at some of the busiest ports in the country--over 4 years after 9/11.Mr. Chairman, the Dubai Ports World debacle was a paragon of bureaucratic ineptitude and the shining example of why this legislation is needed. Even those who believe that DPW should currently be administering our nation's ports must concede that the process is broken.The CFIUS process needs more transparency, better oversight and increased fail-safes to ensure that the administration doesn't next absent-mindedly sell our nation's airports to Iran Airports World.This bill mandates that any proposed deal that involves an entity owned by a foreign government trigger an automatic--and thorough--CFIUS review. To be clear, this legislation does not increase barriers for foreign governments interested in investing in the United States--H.R. 556 merely puts in place necessary safeguards to ensure that investments in the United States do not threaten our national security.This legislation also requires that the Securities of Treasury and Homeland Security, or their Deputy Secretaries or Under Secretaries, sign off on all deals before they are completed. We now know that, during the review of the Dubai Ports World deal, low-level bureaucrats approved the transaction without the knowledge of the relevant Cabinet members. By mandating that the under-secretary level is the lowest level authorized to approve these transactions, we will build another fail-safe into the CFIUS process, and, perhaps more importantly, we will put in place a system of accountability, rather than one of finger-pointing.Mr. Chairman, this is a vitally important piece of legislation, which passed unanimously in the last Congress. I ask my colleagues to once again support this important national security measure.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I would like to first thank Chairman Tom Lantos and ranking minority member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, as well as the ranking minority member on the Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia, Mike Pence. These Members joined with me at the very outset of the Congress to introduce H. Res. 107. The resolution is an exercise in compassion and it expresses the sense of the House regarding the three Israeli soldiers who were kidnapped last summer.As of today, Gilad Shalit has been a captive for 261 days, roughly 8\\1/2\\ months; Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev have been captives for 244 days. That is a day more than 8 months. To date, there has been no access to these men by medical personnel or the Red Cross or Red Crescent.They have not been permitted to send mail to their loved ones. We don't know if they are ill, we don't know if they are wounded, we don't know for certain that they are still alive.Mr. Speaker, their captors have sought to turn these three men into something they are not: Bargaining chips, pawns, a kind of political chattel, things that can be swapped for favors or sacrificed at whim. These three men are not things. They are human beings. They have names and families. They have rights as captured soldiers, and they have rights as individuals. And they also have rights under international law.The organizations that have taken these men captive have shown their true character. Withholding doctors and medicine, withholding the Red Cross and Red Crescent visits, withholding basic communications with their families, even just the information that they are still alive, these choices and these acts show what kind of men run Hamas and Hezbollah: They are religious, but they are deeply immoral. They are self-righteous, but they are profoundly cruel. They are blustery and proud, but they are sneaky and manipulative. Decent human beings do not behave this way.Mr. Speaker, decency doesn't depend on international law or multilateral agreements, nor does it depend on nationality. And I am not aware that withholding medical care or basic contact with the outside world is a requirement of either Shia or Sunni Islam, or any of the world's great religions.This kind of brutality and malice is, unfortunately, typical of these organizations and their state sponsors, Syria and Iran. Syria is a thuggish dictatorship which believes its appetite for the Golan Heights legitimizes any crime or cruelty.And Iran's repressive theocracy is both the world's leading sponsor of terrorism and its most dangerous proliferation threat. Viciousness is standard operating procedure for both regimes.We cannot compel such parties to release Gilad, Ehud, and Eldad any more than we can force them to understand the difference between right and wrong. You cannot disgrace someone who is incapable of shame.But we can and we must stand by our ally, the State of Israel. America has had painfully similar experiences at the hands of the same culprits.Out of our own bitter experience, we can express our sympathy and our concern for the captives and for their families. We can let the perpetrators of this barbarism know that we have not forgotten what they have done, and what they are continuing to do. We can bear witness, and we can add our voices to all those who are saying, ``Enough, enough. Let these men go home.''Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

As Bangladesh moves towards a new round of elections, it is imperative that the rule of law and freedom of the press be preserved.The current government has set out an agenda to reform Bangladesh's political system and to stem corruption. We have seen lately the arrest of many previously high-ranking government officials. It is my sincere wish that the standards of responsible governance survive under the caretaker government until free and fair elections take place, elections that I hope will happen in the near term.In this time of great political turmoil in Bangladesh, it is truly inexplicable that the government would focus its scarce resources on prosecuting a journalist.Mr. Choudhury believes in interfaith dialogue between Jews and Muslims as an alternative to religious extremism, and has been commended by the international community for such bravery of thought.Gaining the respect and concern of organizations like the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, Mr. Choudhury has shown immense resiliency after facing numerous political and physical threats.Mr. Choudhury's actions are courageous, not criminal, and it is time for the government of Bangladesh to take decisive action and drop all pending charges. The political leadership of Bangladesh should focus on getting its own house in order instead of mindlessly prosecuting someone for trying to promote international peace and stability.Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "title": "CONCERN ABOUT FARHAD ALIYEV AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN AZERBAIJAN",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I would like to call the House's attention to an important human rights case in Azerbaijan. Mr. Farhad Aliyev, the former minister of economic development and a leading pro-West reformer, has been arrested and charged with planning a coup, though I think his true crime was speaking truth to power in Azerbaijan. Too often, the United States has allowed immediate interests to blind us to the long-term risks associated with ignoring or downplaying significant human rights violations abroad. There is enormous potential in U.S.-Azeri relations, and I want to see this relationship continue to blossom. But we risk implanting a fatal flaw in this development if we are not frank about our concerns about human rights and the rule of law.I submit a March 17, 2007, article from the Washington Times, ``Ex-Azeri official held for 17 months'', by Jason Motlagh, detailing Mr. Aliyev's case for the Congressional Record with my remarks.Baku, Azerbaijan.--The view from Sabina Aliyeva's balcony commands the skyline of this reborn boomtown and the Caspian Sea beyond, but for the past 17 months one stark gray building off to the right has loomed large. Inside, her husband, Farhad Aliyev, the former minister of economic development and a leading pro-West reformer, remains locked in solitary confinement, charged with planning a coup--though no evidence of it has been put before a court of law. International human rights groups and U.S. lawmakers say Mr. Aliyev is a political prisoner whose rights have been violated as he awaits due process. According to Azeri law, a judge must hear his case by April or release him from pretrial detention. The high-profile case comes amid efforts by the Bush administration to secure closer ties with the oil-rich nation, considered to be of increasing importance in a sensitive region. Critics counter that better bilateral relations must be in step with U.S. demands for democratic reform, and not allow a convenient foreign policy to obscure a grim human rights record. Azerbaijan is a secular Muslim country on the western shore of the Caspian Sea, wedged among Iran, Armenia, Russia and Georgia. U.S. officials have stressed its value as a reliable energy supplier, citing continued Azeri oil and natural-gas deliveries to Europe as a counterweight to Russia's state- owned energy giant Gazprom. President Ilham Aliyev--no relation to the accused--has also been a willing partner on security issues. One of the first foreign leaders to contribute troops to missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, he granted U.S. pilots overflight rights in Azeri airspace, and the Pentagon is sponsoring an upgrade of a former Soviet airfield for potential use by American forces. Some observers also point to the sizable and at times restive Azeri minority in Iran as a potential tool if a conflict with the United States or its allies broke out. Azerbaijan insists it will have no part in any military action against the Islamic republic. Azerbaijan has a reputation of being heavy-handed toward its citizens. Before its November 2005 parliamentary elections, condemned by international observers as flawed, riot police reportedly beat up protesters in the streets and arrested hundreds. Farhad Aliyev, his younger brother Rafig, former head of the leading Azeri oil refiner, Azpetrol, and a handful of other officials were summarily arrested on charges of plotting a coup. The vote itself was marred by irregularities, ballot stuffing and intimidation, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Still, President Aliyev was invited to the White House last April. Washington justified his first meeting with President Bush on the basis that his regime is in a different class than autocracies like those in Belarus and Uzbekistan, thus should be engaged rather than left to gravitate toward Moscow or Tehran. Opponents say corruption and ongoing crackdowns on civil freedoms could have a destabilizing effect in Azerbaijan. They say Farhad Aliyev challenged the political establishment to make free-market reforms, to better integrate with the West, and is now being denied U.S. support. ``We're defending Farhad Aliyev because we defend the ideas he represents,'' said Murad Saddadinov, an Azeri human rights activist and former political prisoner. ``If we do not support him, we will soon lose everybody like him in Azerbaijan.'' Mr. Saddadinov said he fears the emergence of a more radical brand of Islam if democratization does not take hold, noting the growing attendance at Wahhabi mosques in the capital. One Western official said he saw ``the potential,'' but doubted such an outcome in the foreseeable future. Appointed by President Ilham Aliyev's father, post-Soviet strongman Heydar Aliyev, who died in 2003 at a U.S. hospital, Farhad Aliyev led a broad campaign to open the economy and reduce the power of state-affiliated monopolists that had long controlled the flow of imports and exports in Azerbaijan. One of Farhad Aliyev's top priorities was an overhaul of the state customs committee, considered by the Azeri public and business community as a corruption machine. Azerbaijan ranked 130th among 163 countries in Transparency International's latest corruption index. ``Corruption is endemic in this country . . . [and the customs] department has been at the top of the list,'' said a European official working in Azerbaijan who deals directly with the government on reform matters. Farhad Aliyev ``was generally regarded as a fair and good businessman, even among a disillusioned Azeri public. The West rightfully saw him as someone to work with--someone with a promising political future.'' An intense rivalry soon developed between Farhad Aliyev and customs chief Kamaleddin Heydarov, whom Mr. Aliyev accused of stifling economic growth by making it hard for new business-- foreign or domestic--to enter Azerbaijan's markets. Both men used the press to try to win over the public and President Aliyev. Azeri news reports agree that state interference was reduced in entrepreneurial activities and certain meddlesome agencies were abolished. Ali, 23, a university student who asked that his full name not be made public, said Farhad Aliyev was well liked at a time most Azeris had tuned out politics. ``He came across as someone who actually cared about people and change, not his bank account,'' said Ali. ``His popularity was definitely growing . . . and is probably why he was removed.'' Farhad Aliyev went out on a limb when he said that as far as Azerbaijan's social and economic development are concerned, ``Russia is Azerbaijan's past, the West is its future.'' On Oct. 19, 2005, weeks after he had told the prosecutor general's office that unspecified criminal groups had threatened to kill him, he was arrested for conspiring to overthrow the government. A corruption charge was later added. Officials accused Farhad Aliyev of paying supporters of Rasul Guliyev, the exiled chairman of a major opposition party, to stir unrest upon his return from the United States to run in the elections. The charge was based on the confession of ousted Finance Minister Fikrat Yusifov, a reputed co-conspirator, who was released two months later. Mr. Guliyev has categorically denied the claim or that he ever met Farhad Aliyev. Analysts queried in the capital agreed that such an association was highly unlikely, given their opposing party affiliations. Charles Both, an American lawyer who represents Farhad Aliyev and his brother, says that since their arrest, the original charges have not been declared in court; no evidence in support of the charges has been offered; no public hearing has been held; and no trial date set. Azerbaijan's law stipulates that pretrial detention can last a maximum of 18 months, meaning the government has until next month to hear the case. Farhad Aliyev suffers from heart problems, including hypertension and hypertrophy, but has been denied sufficient medical attention, according to the International League for Human Rights. To date, his wife and two children have had no contact with him. They say they have been subject to harassment and surveillance by authorities--notably on the day of his arrest when their home was stormed by armed men and valuables were stolen. The family has since moved to a guarded apartment in view of the National Security Ministry, where the brothers are being held. Meanwhile, the business interests of the Aliyev brothers have been confiscated and sold off to ``pro-Russian business enterprises favored by the Azeri authorities,'' according to a study by Mr. Both, the American lawyer. He said the charges against the pair are ``the direct result of Farhad Aliyev's position in open favor of [Azerbaijan's] integration into the international community, closer ties with the United States, [the] European Union . . . and successful implementation of economic reforms and anti- monopoly policy, all of which run counter the interests of many powerful domestic players.''",

    "title": "CALLING ON THE LEAGUE OF ARAB STATES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GENOCIDE IN DARFUR",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and yield myself as much time as I may consume.Madam Speaker, let me first thank the sponsor of this resolution, our friend and colleague from the Bay Area, Barbara Lee, for introducing this important measure. Let me also acknowledge the leadership on the Darfur issue of our distinguished majority leader, our friend and colleague, Steny Hoyer, who recently returned from a very important and timely mission to the region.Madam Speaker, we are still haunted by the echoes of the Holocaust, which Congress commemorated last week in the Capitol rotunda. The message from that horrific time is fresh in our minds as we consider another terrible genocide, the slaughter in the Darfur region of the Sudan.Despite that profound message, the international community has allowed as many as 450,000 people to be killed, by some estimates, in Darfur. The Sudanese Government has been allowed to perpetuate a shocking campaign of terror for too long. And complacent governments around the world have stood on the side lines for too long.So today, the question faces us, will we again fail to heed the message of the Holocaust? Will we allow Khartoum to keep terrorizing the impoverished and desperate minority there into extinction?Slight signs of progress have emerged over the past few weeks, even if it has come too late for the dead. The Sudanese Government agreed to let a 3,000 person strong United Nations peacekeeping force to enter the country and join the African Union troops already there. This is meant to be a stepping stone to a larger and more robust force.But the Sudanese Government made the decision under pressure and only after months of excruciating backtracking and delay. But the Sudanese Government has resisted the U.N.'s efforts to send 20,000 peacekeepers to Darfur. The U.N. has deemed this larger force necessary to protect civilians and to enforce a peace.I have no doubt that Khartoum will continue to play games until they once again feel the pain of international pressure. As we speak, the government there is deliberately intimidating aid workers in Darfur. Let me be clear: The difference between a small, targeted force and a very substantial deployment is no mere sticking point. It is absolutely essential.It is essential to stopping the Arab militias from continuing to carry out the government's dirty deeds. It is essential to clearing the path for crucial food and water and health supplies to reach the refugee camps. And it is essential because injustice is only really addressed when it is obliterated, not when it is slowed to a painful trickle of displacement, harassment and disrupted lives. We must have that bigger U.N. force in the Sudan.Now, finally, the international community has spoken with one voice. But more pressure needs to be applied. They cannot be allowed to slide backward this time.The resolution before the House today urges those who may have the most influence, the Arab League and its member states, to take dramatic steps to help bring peace to Darfur.The resolution urges the Arab states to declare the systematic torture, rape and displacement of Darfurians a genocide, and to support and accept U.N. peacekeepers. It also urges the Arab League to work with the United Nations, the African Union and the United States Presidential Special Envoy for the Sudan, Andrew Natsios, to bring about peace and stability to Darfur, the refugee camps, and along the Chadian border.I believe it is the solemn duty of all who have said ``never again'' to speak out about genocide, especially this brutal one in Darfur. More importantly, I believe it is our duty in this Congress to do something about it without any delay.I ask all of our colleagues to vote for this important and timely resolution.Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, it is a distinct honor to introduce H. Res. 240, a resolution urging the immediate ratification of the amendments to the 1955 Bonn Accords. This treaty would open the immense records of the Holocaust to Nazi war crime victims in Bad Arolsen, Germany. I would like to thank my good friend from Florida, Representative Alcee Hastings, who introduced this important resolution of which I am a proud cosponsor.Mr. Speaker, the horror of Nazi crimes perpetrated on Jews and others across Europe were accompanied by meticulous recordkeeping that was maintained by the Third Reich throughout the reign of its terrible regime. These accounts include listings of victims, medical records, transport notes and other details that often provide the only history of millions of innocent people who perished at the hands of the Nazis.An abandoned S.S. barracks at Bad Arolsen became the repository for many of these records, where they remained under the control the Allied Forces, and then under a consortium of 11 nations since the end of World War II, some 62 years ago.Throughout those years, these records have been closed to the public. Most survivors' requests have been met with reluctance or disappointing bureaucratic neglect, resulting in some 500,000 legitimate requests for information that were outstanding by the year 2000, some of them made by people who are no longer with us today.Bad Arolsen contains the records of 17.5 million individuals, and I have been told by experts at the Holocaust Museum here in Washington that almost every person to have known to have been a part of that terrible time can be found in those records, victims including Anne Frank, marks of saviors such as Oskar Schindler's famous list, and my octogenarian friend and constituent, Jacob Rosenthal of Long Island, and probably information on my own family members.Mr. Speaker, there is a picture that hangs in my den. It used to hang in my mother's house. The color of the picture is completely in sepia, as was traditional for the time in which it was taken in Poland. It is a picture of the wedding party of my grandfather and grandmother, the grandmother whom I am named after and never met. It is a very old picture. The corners are turned down. It is starting to fade.In front of the entire wedding party sits a whole group of young children sitting on the ground. My mother would point to this picture and point to the little children and say, ``This is my Uncle Chaim, and this one is my Aunt Rachel.'' I would ask, ``Mom, they are only children. How can they be your aunt and your uncle?'' And her response was, ``They will always be children.''My mother never knew what happened to them. She would have liked to have known. Maybe those records will tell us what happened to them.For survivors of the Holocaust, such as our good friend and colleague and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Lantos, time for answers, for truth, for recognition that our loved ones existed and mattered is running out. We need these archives opened now, not next year, not a decade from now when fewer survivors will be here to find peace and possibly a strong degree of closure in the material in these archives. And perhaps opening these archives of over 17 million people will in part answer those evil people like the President of Iran, Mr. Ahmadinejad, who claims that the Holocaust never existed.Our good friend from Kansas spoke on another bill and he cited scripture from Isaiah saying ``you be my witness.'' The Nazis were their own witnesses and documented in tremendous detail the lives of all of these people, as well as their deaths.The 1955 Bonn Accords Treaty governs these records. The 11 countries that signed that treaty agreed in 1998 to open these records to the public, but it did not happen. Last year, these nations agreed to ensure not only the opening of the records, but also the sharing of digitized copies and access for researchers.Diplomatically, substantial progress has been made in recent years in achieving international agreement. Four countries have ratified the 2006 amendments: the United States, Israel, Poland and the Netherlands. With this resolution, Congress urgently encourages the remaining seven countries to ratify the amendments by May of 2007. Next month is the deadline, and we insist we make the digital archives records available as soon as they are ready this summer.Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this resolution, and urge all of our colleagues to do the same.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.To my good friend from California, as well as my good friend from Ohio, I would address the following observations and concerns. First, I would like to thank each of them for their support for this resolution condemning Hezbollah for their actions.But I would like to note for the record that there is a tremendous difference between a perpetrator and a victim. A perpetrator is the one who initiates the act. The victim is the one who is victimized by the act. Very often, in an act of violence, murder, mayhem, the victim fights back. The victim has every single right in the world, legally and morally, to defend itself against violence. Some might argue sometimes that in defense of oneself, the victim goes too far. The woman being raped tries to scratch out the eyes of the rapist. Who is to blame her?I thank my two friends for also pointing out that there is a difference in systems, that there is a difference in moral values between that which the Hezbollah does and the response of the Israelis. I appreciated the fact that the gentleman from Ohio brought in part of a weapon of destruction that was used in self-defense, but I am also happy that we did not bring in gory pictures of Israeli children and women on their way to school or working on farms or in their villages, who every day are subject to attacks and missiles fired by Hezbollah as they go about their daily, innocent lives.I thank the gentleman from California for calling to the House's attention in so eloquent a way of what is rarely government and governance and society and what Israel is all about, who points out graphically and with the evidence he brought before us the fact that it was an Israeli human rights defender who called out to the Israeli soldiers whose conduct he properly called into question, that they have no right to do that and that there are laws against it.Where were the Lebanese people calling out to the Hezbollah who invaded their homes and their neighborhoods and took over and used them, sometimes willingly, sometimes not, as human shields, and said to them, we forbid you to do this, it's against our human rights, and it's against our laws? Not once.I thank the gentleman from California for pointing out the Israeli system of justice, which stands basically equal to ours. We, too, in the pursuit of terrorists and evildoers, as the President would call them, sometimes unfortunately commit acts in that pursuit and in defense of ourselves against the terrorists, where civilians are hurt and civilians do die. But that is not our purpose. When the Hezbollah does that, that is their intention for the civilians to die.I thank the gentleman from California for pointing out that this went through the Israeli justice system because it is contrary to the laws of the democracy of the democratic State of Israel. It went to the Supreme Court of Israel, and that court found, in full view, because Israeli television shows showed their soldiers doing something wrong, and they were charged, and the court found them guilty, and the court banned it.People were held responsible in a responsible society. That did not happen with the Hezbollah. That did not happen in Lebanon. It happened in Israel where people paid the price, where the military officers who were in charge of the operation were found guilty.That is the difference between a democratic, humane society, where there are innocent victims of self-defense, who unfortunately, as individuals within the military, sometimes get carried away. That happens in every army in the history of the world. But holding people responsible for those individual actions is a sign of a true democracy.That did not happen with the Hezbollah. That did not happen with Lebanon. That is the difference between democratic, humane societies and terrorist organizations.I thank our two colleagues for bringing this to the attention of the House so that we might highlight the differences between two societies, Hezbollah, governed by terror, whose only purpose is to wreak havoc upon civilian populations, and a democracy like Israel, who responds to terrorism and sometimes have unfortunate incidents for which they hold individuals responsible and who pay the price.",

    "title": "IN RECOGNITION OF RABBI JEROME DAVIDSON",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the retirement of Rabbi Jerome Davidson after nearly 50 years of dedicated service to the community of Great Neck, New York.Rabbi Jerome Davidson is no ordinary rabbi. He has successfully fused his life as a religious leader and a Jewish mentor together with his commitment to a life of civic engagement and Tikkun Olam, or repairing the world. Throughout his years of service, Rabbi Davidson has effectively transcended the walls of Temple Beth-El of Great Neck in Nassau County, New York, establishing himself as an inspirational leader for both his congregation and community.Jerome Davidson joined Temple Beth-El, a member congregation of the Union for Reform Judaism, as an assistant rabbi in 1958, and became its senior rabbi in 1971. Rabbi Davidson soon impressed the congregation with his dynamic sermons, driven enthusiasm and compelling sense of humor. Rabbi Davidson's brilliance and erudition were key in shaping the congregation's future. The educational opportunities presented by the Temple's comprehensive library and historical museum were central to Rabbi Davidson's success in teaching his congregants. Under his devoted tutelage, Temple Beth-El grew to become a thriving beacon of Jewish life in Great Neck; an arena of countless Bnai Mitzvah, weddings, other life-cycle events and social affairs.Rabbi Davidson also laid the foundations of a successful Religious School and Early Childhood Education Center that addressed the needs of the diversified and growing congregation. Rabbi Davidson's exceptional creativity and boundless imagination confirmed Temple Beth-El, with its impressive membership of over 1200 families, as one of the most innovative and energetic Reform congregations in America. His uncoupled wisdom and unbridled inspiration served as a source of strength and encouragement in the aftermath of a devastating fire that struck the Temple in 1991.Rabbi Davidson's steady rise to Jewish national iconography is no surprise considering the unique leadership qualities he demonstrated in serving Temple Beth-El. Rabbi Davidson's service as President of the Synagogue Council of America, as well as past president of the Rabbinic Alumni Association of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion only cemented Rabbi Davidson as a true Jewish leader.Madam Speaker, Rabbi Davidson's commitment to Reform Judaism informed and complemented his involvement in pluralism and social justice. Rabbi Davidson's multiple terms as President of the Great Neck Clergy Association, and his groundbreaking efforts in developing interfaith dialogue, have served to better the lives of those around him, successfully realizing his lofty goals of building a community of tolerance and understanding. Rabbi Davidson's exemplary interfaith achievements, coupled with his involvement as a founding member of the American Jewish World Service, led the New York Board of Rabbis to honor him ``Rabbi of the Year'' in 1994.More recently, Rabbi Davidson has been a trailblazer in formally welcoming the gay and lesbian community into Jewish life. He has likewise advocated for religious pluralism in Israel. Today, Rabbi Davidson continues to serve on the faculty of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion and as a member of its Board of Governors. Rabbi Davidson also serves on the Advisory Board of the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding, and is deeply involved in a plethora of other local and national Jewish organizations. Rabbi Davidson's adept ability for translating his values into action by positively affecting the world around him is truly an inspiration to all of those whose lives he has touched.Madam Speaker, the accolades bestowed upon Jerome Davidson for his almost 50 years of outstanding service to the Long Island community are well deserved. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in honoring Rabbi Jerome Davidson for his outstanding work and wishing him many more years of success as he becomes Rabbi Emeritus of Temple Beth-El of Great Neck, New York.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2293, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.The legislation the House is considering today will ensure that three brave Americans are not forgotten. I want to thank Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen and my friend, the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Pence, for their support and cosponsorship of the bill.Though my belief in the necessity of this legislation is complete, my feelings about the bill are mixed. I am proud that this House will today insist that justice be done for three Americans who died in the service of their country. But I am deeply troubled and saddened that this legislation is even necessary.On October 15, 2003, John Branchizio, Mark Parson, and John Marin Linde were killed due to the detonation of a roadside car bomb in Beit Hanoun in the Gaza Strip. These young Americans were providing security to a mission of American diplomats on their way to Gaza to conduct interviews for Fulbright scholars to come to the United States. But they never made it.Despite the easily recognized vehicles and the diplomatic plates marking them clearly as Americans, despite coordination with the Palestinian security authorities, despite the fact that they were on a mission of kindness and generosity, their lives were ended by a brutal and cowardly act. And ever since then, United States Government employees have been barred from entering Gaza.Their deaths were tragic. But what followed, however, was a farce.The attack took place near a manned Palestinian checkpoint; and immediately following the attack, journalists photographed Palestinian police officers standing by as onlookers cheered the attack and roamed the crime scene destroying critical evidence. But within 24 hours, the Palestinian Authority, quite literally, ``rounded up the usual suspects,'' four members of the so-called Popular Resistance Committee, or PRC.Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority, however, never presented a case against them. Held over for a month, the Palestinian court finally announced that the defendants would be released since ``no evidence was offered against'' them. They remained in jail despite the judge's order, however, pending Yasser Arafat's approval of their release. When that approval never came, a mob of PRC members stormed the jail the next month, without resistance, and freed the suspects.A year later, on September 22, 2004, Arafat's cousin, the head of military intelligence in Gaza, told the Associated Press that though the identity of the killers was known, the United States would have to forgo justice in this case. Speaking of our Nation, he said, ``They know that we are in a very critical position and clashing with any Palestinian party under the presence of the occupation is an issue that will present many problems for us.''``The Americans,'' he added, ``have started recently to understand our position and I expect that this crisis will also be resolved.''Six months later, Secretary Condoleezza Rice raised the matter directly with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. I don't know that Abu Mazen, as Abbas is known, told our Secretary of State, but she publicly announced on February 7, 2006, ``We have been assured by President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority's intention to bring justice to those who murdered three American personnel in Gaza in Obviously, we are still waiting and with the Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip, we may never know the truth, and justice may never be done.I have been outspoken in my criticism of the administration's failure to use the fresh mandate Abbas had in 2006 to make real progress toward peace. We failed him, as did the Israelis, and we are now confronting the consequences of our shortsightedness. But in this case, in this small but meaningful case, Abu Mazen has failed us.The case presented an opportunity to establish the Palestinian Authority's writ, to demonstrate that the PA was capable of handling the duties of a state, which above all is obliged to maintain law and order, for visitor and citizen alike.There is still a $5 million bounty pending, through the Rewards for Justice program, but I doubt it will ever be paid. The Bush administration has been so lack in dealing with this case, so lackadaisical in the pursuit of justice for three Americans who died in the service of this Nation that I believe Congress must step in.It is not in our power to compel justice, nor can we instill drive, initiative, or energy. But we can maintain accountability, and that is what this bill would do. Thirty days after passage, and every 120 days thereafter, the Secretary of State will have to present Congress with a progress report, and not a short one either. This report would require details, the kinds of sticky uncomfortable deals, the kind of sticky uncomfortable details that will show whether the Department is insisting on the pursuit of justice, or just waiting for it to show up on its own. We are not asking for the impossible. The most important requirement of the report is a specific assessment of whether the Palestinians are making their best effort and possible resolution.Today, it is hard to say what that would look like. But very deliberately, this report will be prepared every 120 days in perpetuity until the Secretary can certify that the Palestinian terrorists who killed John Branchizio, Mark Parson, and John Marin Linde have been identified, arrested, and brought to justice.I regret saying it, but justice for these three men was never as great a priority for the Bush administration as it ought to have been.The vital national security interests of the United States require us to safeguard to the greatest extent possible consistent with their mission United States diploma tics and all embassy and consulate personnel, and to use the full power of the United States to bring justice to any individual or entity that threatens, jeopardizes, or harms them.Every man and woman working for the United States abroad deserves this commitment. And so many months after their deaths, John Branchizio, Mark Parson, and John Marin Linde deserve this much at the very least. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, there have been many justifications for why we went to war in Iraq. Take your pick: We invaded to capture Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, or we invaded to oppose a dictator and bring democracy and human equal rights to the Iraqi people, or we invaded to fight al Qaeda and prevent them from attacking us here.So many reasons have been offered that you can mix and match one from column A, two from column B.Whatever your favorite reason for invading Iraq, the one reason that was never offered was that we are invading Iraq to occupy their land, establish permanent bases and control their oil. Yet, among Iraqis, this perception is that the establishment of permanent bases is precisely why we invaded. The insurgents use that perception to recruit fighters and incite attacks on our troops.The bill before us today, introduced by our colleagues, Barbara Lee and Tom Allen, along with Jim Moran and David Price, will help combat that perception. It states that it is the policy of the United States not to establish permanent bases in Iraq and not to control Iraq's oil resources.Mr. Speaker, this is not the first time that the House has spoken on the issue. Six separate times the House has passed legislation prohibiting or expressing opposition to the establishment of permanent military bases in Iraq. Three of those bills have been signed into law. Yet, from the President, we continue to get mixed messages.In May, the President's spokesman talked about a U.S. presence in Iraq that looked like our presence in South Korea. Last month, Secretary Gates suggested that the President was considering a long and enduring presence in Iraq.Whatever your position on the war, I don't think anyone here in this House believes that we should be in Iraq for over 50 years. In case anyone needed any further convincing that pursuing a long-term presence in Iraq is unwise, the Iraq Study Group was unequivocal on the point of permanent bases. ``The President should state that the United States does not seek permanent military bases in Iraq''. But instead of standing down when the Iraqis stand up, the President seems intent on putting down roots. It is the wrong policy yet again.The Lee-Allen bill will send an important message again that the United States has no interest in permanent bases.Mr. Speaker, I urge all of our colleagues to support it.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "title": "PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2761, TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007",
    "text": "I thank the other gentleman from New York.Mr. Speaker, there are equities on both sides of this issue.First of all, I think that we all have to and do understand that in order for any major development project to go forward, developers have to put together a plan, they have to put together their financing. Financing has to be secured in order for financing to be assured. Insurance has to be issued for any major project to go forward. There is no insurer that I can think of that would put $10 billion on the line without some backup in this day and age by the Federal Government, and I think that we're all pretty much in agreement to that.In this argument of what to do on this rule and how to proceed, there are equities on both sides. It has been my view that the first thing that we should do is fix the rule so that in case this country is under a terrorist attack anywhere in the country, and this is not just New York City, we've been attacked, we've been attacked already, but anywhere in the country where a terrorist attack involving huge amounts of money, that the Federal Government would step in and we would not worry about the budget and the bottom line and balancing. Any city, any town, any State, any American community deserves to know that if America is attacked, and attacked in their city, in their neighborhood, in their community, that America stands behind them and will help make them whole and help put them back together again.So it makes tremendous sense that the rule on PAYGO that was instituted and put into the rules of this House be made to accommodate the situation that says, in the case of war and in the case of a terrorist attack, nothing is going to stop us from moving forward, doing the business of America and assuring the American people.My friends on the Republican side understand that, and they were helping to try to put this together. But the approach that we have taken up until this very moment, and, that is, putting the bill forward and then looking to find a fix later on down the road in my view was putting the horse in back of the cart. That has to be fixed, and that has to be addressed.I originally came down here with the intent of opposing the rule, opposing the rule not because I oppose the bill, because I serve on the Financial Services Committee and worked very hard under the leadership and tutelage of Chairman Frank who has done an immense job together with our Republican colleagues on the committee to bring a great bill to the floor only to find that it was subject to PAYGO.I've come to the conclusion, Mr. Speaker, that we should not be looking to sidestep PAYGO. We should not be looking to make an exception to PAYGO. We should not be looking to work around PAYGO. What we should be doing is bringing common sense to the process and amending the PAYGO rules so that in the case of a terrorist attack, PAYGO is not applicable, not that we make an end run around it.In the last few moments, Mr. Speaker, I have, after consultation with the majority leader, received a letter from him, and he has been in meetings with the Speaker of the House on this up until this very moment. And those who have intended to oppose the rule have received in writing from the majority leader, after consultation with the Speaker, an assurance in writing in this letter to us that this process will not go forward in its final form for a second vote in the House until we not sidestep PAYGO, but address the issue of PAYGO and make it right so that it makes common sense to the House and to the American people.I have that assurance, Mr. Speaker, that this process will be fixed and that we are engaged in an ongoing process, that this vote will not be the final step, that the vote after the rule on the bill will not be final, that this bill will not be brought before us in the conference, that we will reverse and put the horse in front of the cart.I would urge those with whom I have conferred, New Yorkers and others who were very, very concerned about this process, that with the assurance of the Speaker of the House and the majority leader of the House with whom I have worked for 25 years and whose word is gold, that we will bring common sense to this process and fix it before this process is through.",

    "title": "TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007",
    "text": "Mr. Chairman, on September 11, in addition to the enormous loss of human life, the value of which cannot be measured, our Nation suffered catastrophic economic losses. The attacks of September 11 resulted in $30 billion worth of insured losses, the largest catastrophic insurance loss in the history of the United States, larger than any blizzard, tornado or hurricane. As a result, insurers and reinsurers began to worry about the likelihood and the cost of a future terrorist attack.Worrying about risk and then monetizing that risk is the key to the insurance industry, which is an essential element in a modern dynamic economy. As happened, businesses with legitimate concerns about their solvency, insurance and reinsurance firms withdrew from the market where the attack took place. As the supply of terrorism insurance rapidly decreased, New York City developers, for whom terrorism insurance was essential to secure financing for their projects, were put in a precarious position. They needed terrorism insurance to continue building, but the market for insurance simply did not have enough supply to meet their demand. Similar shortages began occurring throughout the country. In simple terms, there was a market failure.It was out of this dilemma that the critical need to address that original version of TRIA was born. TRIA increased the availability of terrorism insurance coverage by creating a Federal backstop that would share the burden of losses caused by any future attacks of terrorism with the insurance industry.In the wake of 9/11, we had hoped that a temporary, 3-year program would provide enough of a shield to allow the market to fully recover. By late 2005, however, the Financial Services Committee and others in Congress realized that TRIA had not resulted in as quick or as robust a recovery of the market as was originally hoped. TRIA was extended for an additional 2 years, and is currently set to expire on December 31 of this year.Mr. Chairman, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act is a major achievement. It eliminates the distinction between foreign and domestic acts of terror. It incorporates group life insurance into the program. And, most importantly, this legislation extends TRIA for another 15 years.Let us be clear: the enemy of business is uncertainty. This is particularly true for multi-million or multi-billion dollar real estate development projects, the kind that breathe life into our Nation. Designing, securing capital and then contracting for construction is a multi-year process, and if we want these kinds of projects to go forward during these uncertain times, there is simply no alternative to providing a long-term terrorism insurance backstop.Extending TRIA by 15 years is not a whim. It is not an arbitrary number. A 15-year extension would allow developers to secure 10- and 15-year bonds when financing their projects and would cover the life span of construction for our Nation's most innovative and remarkable development projects.Equally as important to our Nation's developers, insurers and reinsurers is the inclusion of the so-called ``reset mechanism'' in this legislation. This language ensures that, in the aftermath of another catastrophic terrorist attack, the affected area or areas do not experience the same capacity problems that we experienced in New York following September 11.To be clear, however, the reset mechanism included in H.R. 2761 is not a special favor extended to New York. Under the language I worked out with Mr. Baker, representing the minority side, in the event of a terrorist attack with losses of $1 billion or greater, the deductibles for any insurance company that pays out losses due to the event immediately would lower to 5 percent, while the nationwide trigger for any insurer for any future event drops to $5 million.Mr. Baker and I also reached agreement on my proposal to enable the Secretary of the Treasury to aggregate the total losses for two or more attacks that occur in the same geographic area in the same year, if the Secretary so chooses, so that if the total insured losses for those events are over $1 billion, the reset mechanism would be triggered. Permitting the Secretary of the Treasury to aggregate the losses of two or more attacks in the same year is absolutely essential to protect our Nation's developers, insurers and reinsurers from a scenario in which the same area suffers a loss of $1 billion in insured losses, either from two or more medium-scale attacks or from one large-scale attack.The reset language is a true bipartisan compromise with the minority, accommodating a vast number of their concerns, and one in which I think Members of both sides should be very pleased. The new language simultaneously addresses the need to boost capacity in our Nation's highest risk areas, while recognizing that in case America suffers another catastrophic terrorist attack anywhere in this Nation, capacity shortages could be expected not only in the geographic area surrounding the site of the attack but also, quite possibly, throughout the Nation as a whole.The chairman has asserted that he would accommodate the needs of those who have complained about the openness of the process, which I assure everybody is open. And as the leader of the conference, when the House goes into conference on this matter, Mr. Chairman, could you give us your assurance that this bill will come back in the kind of form that we will not have an issue?",

    "text": "Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding me the time, as well as for your tireless efforts in support of the legislation that we are considering today.There is no more imperative threat facing the world today than checking Iran's nuclear aspirations. Sometimes, in the midst of urgent debate over the right tactics to use to stop the mullahs' mad march towards the bomb, we lose sight of the big strategic picture. By focusing on the particular costs of each sanction, the monstrous reality of a world in which Iran possesses nuclear weapons can slip into the background. This loss of perspective is a terrible mistake.Critics of H.R. 1400, both here and abroad, see only the cost and the irritants of American sanctions. Their concerns focus on economic liberty and their own bottom line, on their national sovereignty, but not their national security.Protests are heard regarding our insensitivity to the Iranian regime and the likelihood of sanctions hurting the Iranian people. The critics are, unfortunately, missing the point. In a vacuum, sanctions always seem harsh unless you consider the nonpeaceful alternative.To fully and fairly judge the proposals in a sanctions measure such as H.R. 1400, we have to consider what a future without it might look like. If you don't want to see the complete collapse of the nuclear nonproliferation regime and the rapid nuclearization of the entire Middle East, then you're for the bill. If you don't want to see Iranian proxies, such as Hamas and Hezbollah, taking over the Palestinian Authority and the Government of Lebanon, then you're for the bill. If you don't want to see Iran accelerating its supply of arms and training to terrorists around the world, then you're for the bill. If you don't want the supply and the price of oil to be set in Tehran, then you're for the bill. If you don't want to even imagine a nuclear device exploding somewhere, anywhere in the Middle East, then you're for the bill. And, finally, if you do abhor war, if you really don't want to see military force used to stop Iran's nuclear program, if you hate the very idea of America attacking Iran's nuclear program, then you're for this bill.The official title is the Iran Counter-Proliferation Act. The proper title should be the Stop the Iranian Bomb by Every Peaceful Means Possible Act. This is the alternative.We are running out of time. Nuclear weapons in the hands of Iran's mullahs are not inevitable; but to prevent such an international security catastrophe, we need every tool at our disposal now while there is still time. The longer we wait, the greater the danger and difficulty of the challenge we face. Now is the time to apply the absolute maximum diplomatic, political and economic pressure that we can muster.H.R. 1400 will crank up the pressure and help us avoid having to choose between military action and an Iranian atomic bomb. I urge all Members to support this bill.",

Through a campaign of assassinations targeting Lebanese parliamentarians and political figures; bombings in public places; threats to establish an alternative extra-constitutional government; and the instigation of a jihadi insurgency by the Fatah al-Islam, Syria, Iran, their bootlegging proxies, Hezbollah, Amal, and Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement, have brought Lebanon's government to a constitutional crisis. Yet again, outside actors have pushed Lebanon to the brink of civil war for their selfish interests.Just 6 days ago, on September 19, a massive car bomb killed Antoine Ghanem along with five other civilians, and left many dozens of other bystanders wounded. Mr. Ghanem, a member of the Lebanese Parliament and a supporter of the Siniora government, was just the latest in a string of 11 political assassinations over the past 3 years. As a consequence of this pattern of violence, the March 14 alliance is two parliamentarians away from being murdered out of their majority.Now is the time for this Congress to send a strong message of support for the democratically elected and fully legitimate government in Lebanon. Time, Mr. Speaker, is short.The Syrian-backed campaign for murder is creeping ever closer to its goal of destroying the majority of the Lebanese Parliament, bringing down the government of Fuad Siniora, and imposing again a pro-Syrian president on Lebanon.Fearing just this scenario months ago, I introduced H. Res. 548 with the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Pence, with Chairman Lantos and Representatives Issa and Boustany, two Members whose roots extend back to Lebanon. This bipartisan resolution expresses the strong support of the House of Representatives for Lebanon's elected government, and affirms our readiness to make that support tangible in order to help preserve and strengthen Lebanese sovereignty and independence.The resolution condemns Syria and Iran for providing arms to Lebanese militias, particularly the terrorist group Hezbollah, and the Palestinian factions in Lebanon, in clear contravention of Security Council resolutions.H. Res. 548 also endorses prompt action by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon established by the Security Council to investigate the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in February 2005. Syria must know with utter certainty that the United States will never sacrifice justice in Lebanon to allow Damascus to escape accountability for its crimes.The current Lebanese Government, which is under siege, is both legitimate and representative of the majority of Lebanese. The attempts to undermine it are not some kind of retaliation. Lebanon's government is being systemically attacked only because it is unwilling to subordinate its authority and Lebanon's sovereignty to external and extra-legal demands.Quite simply, Lebanon is being bullied. And in light of this fact, the United States and the entire international community must come to its aid.I would urge all of our colleagues to support the resolution.

Rick recently retired after working for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) in a distinguished career that spanned 38 years.After a stint in the U.S. Air Force, Rick's IBEW career began in 1969 when he joined Corpus Christi Local 278 in his native Texas. Always active in politics, Rick also served three terms as mayor protem in the city of Ingleside in the early and mid-1970's. Rick was elected business manager for Local 278 in 1977, and he arrived upon the Washington political scene in 1983 when he was appointed IBEW's Political Director, the same year I was elected to Congress. Then, in 1998, he became director of the IBEW's combined Political/Legislative Department, the position he held until his retirement October 1st, Upon Rick's arrival in Washington, Rick Diegel immediately made an impact on public policy on behalf of the IBEW and its members. Through the support given to IBEW-endorsed candidates in local, state, and federal elections, the IBEW has been able to influence the agenda on vital kitchen-table issues such as job security, the minimum wage, healthcare, working conditions and safety, retirement, and trade. Rick became a major figure in the modern labor movement and helped lead the transformation of the IBEW into the 21st Century.Madam Speaker, I want to commend Rick's tireless dedication to the members of the IBEW and the labor movement as a whole over his almost four-decade career. He will be truly missed by me and the IBEW.Rick will be returning to Texas, where he will be able to have more time with his wife Theresa, his seven children, and four grandchildren. Fortunately, Rick isn't completely leaving the political arena though--he has promised to be available to aid Hillary Clinton's Presidential campaign, so we won't be losing him entirely.Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in thanking Rick Diegel for all of his hard work and dedication as IBEW's lead political architect for over 20 years and in wishing him and his family the best of luck in his retirement.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and yield myself such time as I may consume.Madam Speaker, when the House last discussed Lebanon on September 25, I said that Lebanon was being bullied. That statement, though true, is insufficient. Lebanon is not being harassed by invisible unworldly forces. Lebanon is not a victim of fate or destiny or bad luck. Lebanese politicians and public figures, beginning with Rafiq Hariri and continuing to this day, are not being assassinated and blown away by falling meteors or volcanic eruptions. Arms do not appear in Lebanon by magic. Hezbollah's billions do not fall from the sky like rain. Palestinian terrorist groups don't find rifles falling out of trees or by the side of the road. The Fatah al-Islam and its war against the Lebanese state were not the product of spontaneous auto-genesis. Like maggots, their origin can escape the casual observer, but their birth was no accident or mystery.Madam Speaker, Syria and Iran are responsible for these crimes. Syria and Iran are responsible for the chaos. Syria and Iran are to blame for the shadow of civil war that hangs over Lebanon. Lebanese politics are complex, and the interaction within and among confessions is daunting for the outside observer to contemplate. Where interest and principle merge and depart is hard to judge. But we know some things about Lebanon for certain, and they are spelled out clearly in the resolution at hand.Despite Lebanon's Constitution, Syria demanded the extension of President Emile Lahoud's term in 2004, and Damascus got its way. The principal opponent of this grotesque intrusion into Lebanon's affairs was Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. There is credible evidence uncovered by U.N. investigators showing that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad first threatened and then ordered the assassination of Rafiq Hariri for his defiance of Syrian diktat.Madam Speaker, in response to the murder of Hariri, and, let us remember, 22 other civilians, the Lebanese rose up against their Syrian overlords and demanded, with the full support of the international community, the expulsion of Syria's occupational forces. A new government was formed through a free and fair election led by Lebanese not in the service of Syria and not in the debt of Iran.This development, both surprising and hopeful, of a Lebanon free to chart its own course, was one that Syria and Iran couldn't tolerate. In their minds, Lebanon is a fiefdom, a toy. Lebanon is a playground for their ambitions and a canvas on which to splash their rage and hatred for the United States and Israel in the modern world.Madam Speaker, Lebanon, in the minds of Syria's overlords and Iran's ayatollahs, is not for the Lebanese. This intolerance, this greedy self-interest, this bitter contempt for the rights of others is why we are speaking of Lebanon in the U.S. House of Representatives again today. Lebanon is in grave peril. Lebanon's independence and sovereignty are under attack by Syria and Iran and their bootlicking Lebanese proxies, Hezbollah, Amal and the Aounist bloc. Extralegally demanding control of the presidency, and threatening civil war, this coalition of the wicked and the selfish have again brought chaos, violence and terror to Lebanon. It need not be so. It should not be so.Syria and Lebanon are responsible for the crisis in Lebanon. Syria and Iran are responsible for the crisis in Lebanon. They have trampled on Lebanon's sovereignty and clearly violated U.N. Security Council resolutions protective of Lebanon. They are the puppet masters pulling on the strings of Hezbollah, Amal and Aoun. The assassinations of Lebanese members of Parliament are their work. The bombings are their work. The threats to establish an extra-legal second government are their work.Madam Speaker, there is no mystery here. There is evil, there is greed, there is indecency, and, were I Lebanese, I might say treason as well. But there is no mystery. Syria and Iran are attacking Lebanon's sovereignty no less than if they sent a fleet of bombers, or a wave of tanks, or a swarm of infantry. That this aggression, this naked aggression is being done by proxies, and by terrorists, by car bombs, by telephone threats does not make it any less aggression, or any less a crime.Many vital interests of the United States are at stake. If we want every nation to be secure in its own borders, we cannot tolerate cross-border aggression. If we want to see the Middle East at peace, we cannot tolerate the resumption of Syrian and Iranian control of Lebanon. If we want to encourage self-governance around the world, we cannot tolerate Lebanon's democracy being subverted by thugs and fanatics. If we want to see people rising up against tyranny, as they are today in Burma, we cannot tolerate the reversal of Lebanon's glorious Cedar Revolution. If we want to see the United Nations become a true guardian of peace, we cannot tolerate the will of the international community being scorned by rogue states.Madam Speaker, America must lead. Even today, even with Iraq, there is still no other state that can mobilize the international community as can the United States, and the hour is desperate. Only if they are convinced that the world will not tolerate their aggression against Lebanon, will Syria and Iran back down. This outcome is not impossible.The stakes are exceedingly high. It is my hope that the Lebanese Government and the Bush administration will see this debate in the House as proof that Congress is watching closely and that we stand ready to help secure Lebanon's future as an independent and sovereign state. If we want to end the bloodshed in Lebanon and foreclose the prospect of still greater violence, we must act now and in concert with the community of nations.There is wide support for Lebanon both in Europe and the Arab and Muslim world, just waiting for a catalyst to give it expression. America must be that catalyst. We are here today to sound the wake-up call. A brighter future for Lebanon, for the Middle East, and for ourselves awaits our clarion call.Madam Speaker, I urge our colleagues to support the resolution.Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "title": "IN RECOGNITION OF JAMES KLURFELD",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to James Klurfeld, vice president and editorial page editor of Newsday, who last week retired after nearly 40 years of outstanding and tireless work at the paper.James Klurfeld was born in 1945 in New York City and is a 1963 graduate of Syosset High School. His illustrious career at Newsday began in 1968, just one year after he graduated from Syracuse University.Klurfeld's first job at Newsday was as a local reporter, where he covered various news stories on Long Island. But he quickly rose through the ranks at the paper, where his extraordinary reporting propelled him into several key positions. He led Newsday's Albany bureau, and he served as the newspaper's Washington bureau chief between 1980 and 1986. After his exceptional leadership during these stints, Klurfeld was appointed editor of the editorial pages in December 1987.James Klurfeld's constant pursuit of journalistic excellence has earned him numerous honors and recognitions. He was a member of the Newsday investigative team that won the 1970 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, as well as the New York State Publisher's Association and Deadline Club award in the same category. The awards were for a 3-year effort that disclosed political corruption in several townships on Long Island. He also won the Sigma Delta Chi National Reporting Award with other members of the Washington bureau in 1982, and he was the recipient of the 1988 American Society of Newspaper Editors Distinguished Writing Award for editorials on the Iran-Contra hearings. In addition, the staff of Newsday's editorial and viewpoints pages won several major awards under his leadership. These included everything from brilliantly written editorials to exceptionally creative cartoons.Over the years, Klurfeld has become incredibly knowledgeable about local and national issues and is an expert on foreign affairs matters, most notably through his extensive travels around the globe and from his work with the Council on Foreign Relations. To this extent, he has provided Newsday readers with extraordinary insights into politics, national security and international policy through the informative and lively column he has written in the paper each week.Klurfeld's achievements in the news business have also extended beyond print journalism. For the past 12 years, he has asked the tough questions on The Cutting Edge, a weekly television program on WLNY/TV55 that focuses on Newsday's Sunday editorials, a show in which I have been honored to appear. I was also privileged to be part of some of his many appearances on Long Island's public broadcasting station, WLIW/Channel 21. In addition, he has provided exceptional analysis and commentary on other broadcast outlets including the CW11 in New York City.James Klurfeld's exit from Newsday is the end of an era for journalism on Long Island, in New York City and across the Nation. We will miss his leadership, his quest for the truth and his shaping of local and national policy debates.But fortunately, Klurfeld will not be going far. He will remain on Long Island, where he will pass on the craft he has mastered to the next generation of journalists as the interim director of the Center for News Literacy at Stony Brook University's School of Journalism. He will also continue to write his weekly column.Although we are sad to see him retire as Newsday's editorial page editor, we are comforted to know that many students of journalism will learn the press trade from one of the best to have ever worked in the news business.I know that Newsday's staff and readers will be forever grateful for all of James Klurfeld's exceptional and memorable contributions, which have made Newsday a stronger newspaper and have helped the Long Island-New York City area become a better place to live and work.Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me now in congratulating James Klurfeld for nearly 40 years of outstanding service to Newsday. I am confident that he will prevail in his new endeavor and continue to enjoy success for many more years to come.",

    "title": "PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4299, TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York.I rise in strong support of this rule and the underlying legislation, H.R. 4299, which would extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, or TRIA, for 7 years.TRIA is a vital program that has made effective terrorism insurance coverage available across this Nation by creating a Federal backstop to share with the insurance industry the burdens of losses caused by catastrophic acts of terrorism upon our country.The certainty and stability that TRIA has provided over the past 6 years has allowed large-scale developers to plan, to secure financing and insurance and, ultimately, to build the types of multimillion- or multibillion-dollar real estate development projects in our capitalistic system, projects that shape our cities and invigorate the American economy.With TRIA set to expire at the end of the month, I am particularly grateful that our leadership and Chairman Frank and our friends on the minority side are insisting that Congress renew this vital program before we run out of time and insurers are forced, in an act of self-preservation, to abandon our Nation's largest projects.This rule will allow the House to consider legislation to reauthorize TRIA for the second time in 3 months. My colleagues may recall passing H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act. H.R. 2761 was a triumph for bipartisanship, regular order, good-faith bargaining and effective government. It sought to extend TRIA for another 15 years, added group life insurance to the program, lowered the program trigger, provided for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological, the so-called NBCR coverage.And most importantly, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2761 included the so-called ``reset mechanism,'' which, in the wake of a catastrophic terrorist attack, lowered the nationwide program trigger and decreased the deductibles for any insurer that paid out losses after an attack on our country. This provision was and is absolutely critical to meeting the demand for terrorism insurance across our Nation, and especially in our high-risk areas.On September 19, the House overwhelmingly passed H.R. 2761 with a bipartisan vote of 312-110. And with the clock ticking toward the program's expiration date, we waited for the Senate to act. And we kept waiting and we kept waiting, and we waited some more. Then, once the House had adjourned for Thanksgiving, and only once the House had adjourned for Thanksgiving, the Senate quickly passed, by unanimous consent, a shell of a bill that simply extended the program to 7 years, stripping out the key provisions that were vital and put in there on a bipartisan House-passed bill.We believed that we would have had the opportunity to negotiate on many of the issues in a conference with the Senate, but the Senate unacceptably and irresponsibly has refused again and again to conference with the House on the Senate bill, leaving us with few, but not zero, options.Mr. Speaker, this rule will allow the House to consider a compromised bill that accepts the Senate's position on the extension period, as well as the Senate's opposition to protecting us with NBCR coverage. This compromised bill, however, does stand firm on the House's key priorities, the reset mechanism, group life insurance, and lower program triggers.Passage of this rule will allow the House to reaffirm its equality in the legislative process and reject the Senate's take-it-or-leave-it attitude. I urge all of our colleagues to support the rule and the underlying legislation.",

    "title": "TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, it has been almost a year since the Committee on Financial Services began the process of reauthorizing the terrorism risk insurance program. It has been 9 months since our committee held a field hearing in New York at which we heard experts, insurers, developers and reinsurers testify about the private market for terrorism insurance which has not grown enough since 9/11 to sufficiently meet the demand in many of our Nation's so-called high-risk areas.It has been over 4 months since we held a subcommittee and a full committee markup and almost 3 months since the House overwhelmingly approved H.R. 2761, a strong reauthorization that would have extended TRIA for 15 years, provided group life insurance as well as nuclear, chemical, biological and radiological coverage, and significantly lowered the program's trigger level.Most importantly of all, and after constructive negotiations and compromise with the minority, the House bill included a reset mechanism to address increased capacity shortages following major terrorist attacks such as those that may occur anywhere in our country.And yet despite a proactive bipartisan effort in the House spearheaded by Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus, we find ourselves in the 11th hour with TRIA set to expire at the end of the month, and we are faced with a weak Senate bill that was deliberately sent to us only after we had recessed for Thanksgiving, effectively stalling the negotiation process between the two Chambers.The Senate bill, a 7-year reauthorization that only amends the TRIA program by eliminating the distinction between foreign and domestic acts of terrorism simply does not provide developers, insurers, and reinsurers with enough of the stability they need in our free-market economy to plan, finance, insure and build our Nation's major development projects.Mr. Speaker, for TRIA to be truly effective in addressing the shortages in the terrorism insurance market, we must recognize that the market is dynamic. The terrorism insurance market behaves much differently in the wake of a terrorist attack than it does before an attack. The reset contained in this compromise bill is identical to the reset provision that was included in the House-passed TRIA extension in September, on which I and Mr. Baker of the minority came to a mutually acceptable agreement. Under those terms, which are in this compromise bill, in the event of a terrorist attack with losses of a billion dollars or greater, the deductibles for any insurance company that pays out losses due to the event immediately lower to 5 percent while the nationwide trigger for any insurer for future events drops to $5 million.Mr. Baker and I also reached agreement on my proposal to enable the Secretary of the Treasury to aggregate the total losses of two or more attacks that occur in the same geographic area in the same year so if the total insured losses of those events are over a billion dollars, the reset mechanism would be triggered. The inclusion of this language is absolutely vital to every high-risk area across the country, and many of us consider this to be the most essential, must-be-included aspect of the legislation.My colleagues may recall that the TRIA extension passed by the House in September was subject to PAYGO concerns because the CBO had assessed its cost at roughly $10 billion over 10 years. With this CBO score, some of our friends on the other side of the aisle argued that even though no funds would have been appropriated unless the country was attacked, our bill would have been too much of a burden on the American taxpayer. Not knowing who else to bill for an attack on America, I disagreed with that view and with the CBO scoring; but I, too, am committed to a fiscally responsible bill. I am pleased to say that my fiscally conservative friends on both sides of the aisle can now vote for this bill without any hesitation thanks to the inclusion of language from the Senate bill, and more significantly, because the reset language, this compromise legislation has been assessed to a positive CBO score of $200 million. Let me say that again. This compromise bill that we are debating today will result in a net gain of $200 million. Legislation that protects developers and the insurance industry from terrorist attacks and provides taxpayers with a return on their dime is something that I believe we should all support.Mr. Speaker, the next terrorist attack against the United States, like the one on 9/11, is going to damage more than just buildings. We must acknowledge that the structural losses associated with a terrorist incident will be accompanied by the loss of human life. The legislation before the House today recognizes this fact and includes group life insurance coverage because this Congress is concerned not only with the value of buildings but the people inside of them as well.Our bill lowers the program trigger in the Senate bill from $100 million to $50 million. Our lower trigger would prevent smaller insurance companies from being priced out of the terrorism insurance market. And, with a greater supply of insurance, we can expect a higher degree of stability for large-scale developers all over America.Mr. Speaker, in the absence of a formal conference which most of us in this body would have preferred, we have taken it upon ourselves to consider this legislation in which we have compromised with the Senate on many of their issues but hold firm on those provisions that we believe must be included in TRIA: the reset mechanism, group life coverage, and lower triggers.I urge all of our colleagues to support this important compromise legislation and, as the clock strikes 11:59, to place the burden of responsibility back on the broad shoulders of the United States Senate.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.First, I would like to extend thanks and appreciation for the effort and hard work of Mr. Bachus and Mr. Baker, as well as Mr. Kanjorski, Mrs. Maloney, the extraordinary efforts of my friend from New York, Pete King, and of course to Chairman Frank for his extraordinary leadership, as well as the entire New York legislative delegation, including our friends from New Jersey and Connecticut, who all know firsthand the anguish and the pain of regions suffering from a terrorist attack.Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us today, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act, with Senate amendments, is not the outcome that most of us in the House on both sides of the aisle had wanted. In September, after a series of subcommittee and full committee hearings, a field hearing, and following both subcommittee and full committee markups, the House overwhelmingly passed H.R. 2761 by a strong bipartisan margin of 3-1. H.R. 2761 would have extended TRIA for 15 years. It would have eliminated the distinction between foreign and domestic acts of terrorism. It would have included coverage for human beings by adding group life, and for nuclear, chemical, biological, and radiological, the so-called NCBR attacks. Most importantly, H.R. 2761 included a reset mechanism, which would have addressed the types of increased capacity shortages that we have already seen following major terrorism attacks against our country.I want to be clear about this. The reset mechanism is not a New York provision. In negotiations with Mr. Baker of the minority, we worked out the reset mechanism that would be triggered for any future catastrophic attack anyplace in America. Under the reset, if, heaven forbid, our country does suffer another catastrophic attack, the nationwide trigger would be reset and the nationwide deductible for any insurer that pays out losses related to that attack would be set at lower levels.God willing, New York will never suffer a second time, and, God willing, your State will never suffer a catastrophic attack such as 9/11. But if it does, then you too would enjoy the so-called ``benefit'' of being attacked a second time by virtue of the existence of the reset mechanism.Let's take, for example, Alabama; Alabama, that fought so hard and received $130.5 million in Homeland Security grants because it is at risk of an attack by terrorists. We know that for a fact because its Senators and others told us so. God forbid, terrorists blow up the Medical Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Under this legislation, you will be covered. Without a reset, however, after a catastrophic attack, the supply of terrorism insurance could be so scarce that you would not be able rebuild the medical center, which had been in Birmingham, and rebuild it in Birmingham, Alabama. I only pick Alabama, I think, because I went in alphabetical order. Sometimes bad things happen in alphabetical order. I don't read the obituaries because people die in alphabetical order.In short, the House bill, which included the reset, would have met the needs of our country and prepared the Nation to better cope with some of the grave financial issues that would have arisen if there were another terrorist attack on our Nation.Mr. Speaker, when the House passed H.R. 2761 in September, we presented the Senate with an historic opportunity to protect our homeland from some of the economic consequences of terrorism, and specifically to safeguard the developers and the insurers and the re-insurers, who will bear the highest financial burden if our Nation is attacked again. The financial stability of these industries is the cornerstone of our economy, and they are absolutely essential to our capacity to recover from an attack.Sadly, the U.S. Senate didn't seize the opportunity to protect our Nation and our markets. Instead, our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol operated to amend our bill to extend the TRIA program by only 7 years, less than half of the extension period, and to strip out every beneficial provision in our bill, save one. The Senate did accept the House position that the distinction between foreign and domestic acts of terror, in today's world, so often impossible to discern, would be included. Having passed the hollow shell of the bill and having done so only after the House had adjourned for Thanksgiving, our Senate counterparts abandoned the legislative process and they have refused to go to conference.Now, faced with the choice between accepting a bad bill and disrupting the U.S. financial markets, the House went to work yet again, Democrats and Republicans, working together, to try to find a compromise with the Senate, and last week we passed a limited but still much-improved TRIA reauthorization over what they had done in the Senate.The compromise legislation the House overwhelmingly passed last week by a vote of 303-116 acquiesced to the Senate's position on duration as well as coverage for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological coverage. That compromise bill accepted the Senate's extension of TRIA, which was for only 7 years, and eliminated NCBR coverage. The House held firm, however, to the provisions we felt were absolutely necessary to allow for large-scale development to continue all across our country; the extension of a reset mechanism, group life insurance coverage, and lower program triggers.Mr. Speaker, the House overwhelmingly passed the compromise TRIA reauthorization last week, and the Senate, as has been so often the case this year, did nothing. And so, today, we are faced with a very difficult reality: We can either accept the Senate's shell of a bill and ensure that our Nation's economy is somewhat protected against terrorist attacks, or we can let the program expire altogether in less than 2 weeks from today. Maybe that is considered good government in some parts of the country, but entrusting our Nation's economy to the terrorist roulette wheel would not be acceptable to the American people and it is not acceptable to the House, and we must do the responsible thing.The Senate amendments to H.R. 2761 are unhelpful, shortsighted, and represent an unrealistic pre-9/11 outlook. The Senate amendments come from a naive world where there is no risk of terrorism and another attack like 9/11 is impossible. In the Senate's mythical world, developers build stadiums and malls and national landmarks without funding, banks lend money without insurance, insurers underwrite policies regardless of risk, and reinsurers do the same thing on an even larger scale.In the Senate's fantasy world, the $30 billion in insured losses from 9/11 can be easily underwritten and capitalized because unimaginable losses such as those that would come from an attack with weapons of mass destruction just can't happen, and the reason they can't happen is because the U.S. Senate said so.Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Santa Claus is not going to give America terrorism risk insurance for Christmas, and we don't live with the Easter Bunny in the Senate's Candyland, where catastrophic risk can be comfortably ignored. Saying ``the market will provide'' just doesn't make it true. In the real world, it is critical to both our national security and to our economy that there is no gap in terrorism risk insurance. This House will not leave our Nation's developers, insurers and reinsurers out in the cold when we adjourn for the year.I therefore urge all of our colleagues to support this legislation out of the necessity to extend the TRIA program past its expiration date, with the understanding that this fight is not over.We will continue to advocate for those provisions we know are critical to securing our homeland against terrorist attacks; namely, the reset mechanism, group life coverage, lower program triggers and NCBR coverage. To that extent, I have just introduced legislation entitled the Terrorism Risk Insurance Improvement Act that will add the reset mechanism to the TRIA program we are about to authorize here today, and I invite all of our colleagues to join me as cosponsors. We will continue to fight for a fully effective TRIA program until the Senate and the White House get the memo that the war on terror is not only fought on the other side of the world, but on the homefront as well.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

He led his caucus, along with Mr. Baker, in crafting what was a very open process led by the distinguished chairman, Mr. Frank, of the full committee, where everybody's voice was heard; everybody's opinion was allowed to be aired. We fought it out. Not everybody won every fight, but it was an extraordinary effort in goodwill. And the efforts of the Financial Services Committee should be something that set an example for the rest of the committees in the Congress, especially on this particular issue, everybody exercising goodwill and good judgment.Let me thank my staff especially Steve Boms, who, unfortunately, became one of our Nation's leading experts on terrorism risk insurance.Much has been said about the New York delegation, because, I think, of our high profile on this issue. But allow me to thank our colleagues and offer this: do not feel sorry for us. We do not make this case for your pity, because we think that our city, we think that our communities, we think that our State and our neighbors acted in an exemplary fashion at a moment of extraordinary terror and pressure, not just to us but to the entire Nation and to the world. What we faced was absolutely extraordinary, and we are so proud to be New Yorkers, and we make this fight not because of what we suffered as a city and a State, but because we already know the pain and the problems that each and every one of our colleagues and other communities across this country might face in the event of a terrorist attack.Much has been said of the courage of New York. We do not end this fight here because this fight is not for us.First, to those who have expressed concern about the cost of money as taxpayer money, let me say that the way this has been added up by CBO, the taxpayers would actually gain $200 million if there were a terrorist attack because of the scoring.

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.First, I want to congratulate Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for producing an excellent bipartisan bill. The Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act demonstrates yet again the depth of support in the Congress for our efforts in Afghanistan to defeat the Taliban and al Qaeda and sends a clear message to the Government of Afghanistan and the Afghan people that the United States is committed to the success of a stable, free and democratic Afghanistan.As the bill also points out, we remain far from that goal, and it is not at all certain we will get there. The amendment I am offering today concerns a problem that if left unaddressed could undercut all of our efforts in Afghanistan, and that is the problem of corruption.The Government Accountability Office in a recent report said the reform effort in the judicial sector is being ``undermined by systemic corruption at key national and provincial justice institutions.'' The most recent report in Afghanistan from the U.N. Secretary General noted that because corruption influences government appointments, Afghans don't trust local government officials and have turned to making deals with the Taliban for protection of their property. The same report goes on to describe the popular alienation that many Afghans feel towards local governments and asserts that this alienation is a key factor in support for the insurgency.My amendment adds language to section 302 of the bill to ensure that the Presidential report required by that section includes an assessment of the quality of governments in each province in Afghanistan, focusing in particular on the implementation of the rule of law and its impact on the operation of Afghan society, security forces and the impact of any human rights abuses by Afghan government forces on overall counterinsurgency efforts and the ability of the courts and judicial system to provide an effective justice system in support of Afghan military and police efforts.Mr. Chairman, the question of corruption in Afghanistan may seem like a small matter when compared with the resurgence of the Taliban and the explosion of narcotics trafficking. But I believe for the Taliban to be defeated and for the narcotics traffickers to be imprisoned, ordinary Afghans must have confidence that their government actually works for them. If the citizens of Afghanistan believe otherwise, then they will turn to local warlords, drug traffickers and the Taliban for protection. Under that scenario, Afghans can look forward to another generation of civil conflict.I would urge all of our colleagues to support the amendment as well as the underlying bill.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Madam Speaker, on December 27, former Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in Rawalpindi as she left a peaceful political rally. In addition, 20 of her supporters were killed in a suicide bomb blast and Pakistan was wracked by violence and instability in the immediate aftermath.Former Prime Minister Bhutto had returned to Pakistan in October after several years in exile in an attempt to bring Pakistan back to the democratic fold and inject the voice of moderation into the Pakistani parliamentary elections. Her killers cut short that effort in an attack that was one of 40 suicide bombings that killed 700 people in Pakistan during 2007.Ms. Bhutto's life was marked by tragedy that played out on Pakistan's public stage. Her father was hung after a questionable trial. Her brother was murdered. As Prime Minister, she was twice removed from office by the army amid allegations of corruption and wound up in self-imposed exile. Yet she remained very popular with the people of Pakistan, especially those in her home province of Sindh, and as the awful events of December 27 demonstrate, she was perceived as a threat by someone.The United States and the rest of the international community have a vital interest in supporting a free, stable, and secure Pakistan so as to stem the rise of extremism in South Asia, prevent global acts of terrorism from originating in Pakistan, and support the movement toward stable political institutions, democratic values, and the rule of law.The fact that al Qaeda, the Taliban and other extremist elements are using the federally administered tribal areas to regroup, retain and recruit for future attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan is a dangerous component of instability that, when added to Pakistan's possession of nuclear weapons, conjures up the frightening possibility of terrorists with access to weapons of mass destruction.All of this means that the United States and the rest of the international community need to do all that we can to promote and support Pakistan's economic, social and political development to prevent Pakistan from becoming a failed state.The resolution before us today condemns Ms. Bhutto's assassination, expresses condolences to her family and the families of the other victims of the attacks, and reaffirms the commitment of the United States to the people of Pakistan as they combat terrorism and work to establish a free and democratic country. I urge all of our colleagues, Madam Speaker, to support the resolution.I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "title": "REMEMBERING RAFIQ HARIRI AND THE IMPORTANCE OF LEBANON",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in a mixture of sadness and outrage to commemorate the third anniversary of Rafiq Hariri's assassination. Sadness because the former Prime Minister, a man of vision and courage, was cut down in his prime as he stood up for the idea of a Lebanon as a nation free from external control, a sovereign, united and independent Lebanon that would regain its rightful place among the nations of the Middle East.Three years ago a massive car bomb deprived the Hariri family of a husband and father and deprived the Lebanese people of a leader. It would prove to be the first in a dozen political assassinations that have plagued that nation for the last three years orchestrated by the enemies of a free and democratic Lebanon.And it is this fact, Madam Speaker that fills me with outrage and should fill all our colleagues with outrage as well. Lebanon's future continues to be strangled by Iran and Syria whose agents Hezbollah, Amal and Michel Aoun, try to take through violence and intimidation what they cannot achieve at the ballot box. The slow strangulation of the state has left Lebanon without a President for almost 3 months, paralyzing the nation and raising the specter of renewed civil war.On the third anniversary of former Prime Minister Hariri's murder, the international community must renew its commitment to the people of Lebanon and again speak out against the campaign of naked aggression that has left the March 14 movement only two parliamentarians away from losing their hard won majority. We must renew our demand that Damascus and Tehran lift their boots off Lebanon's neck. And we must ensure that justice is done in the case of Rafiq Hariri and all the other victims of the 3 year campaign to deny Lebanon its rightful place among free and independent nations. Toward that end, the United States and the rest of the international community must make it crystal clear to Syria that the Special Tribunal established by the United Nations Security Council to investigate the terrorist attack on February 14, 2005, is not a bargaining chip to be traded away. The interests of justice in this case far outweigh any concession that the government of Syria might hope to offer. The guilty must be held accountable for their crimes.The international community has spoken frequently and eloquently through United Nations Security Council resolutions in support of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political independence of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive authority of the Government of Lebanon, and has demanded the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon. These goals and this unity of purpose must not be abandoned or allowed to wither either from self-interest or distraction. The enemies of Lebanon believe they have time on their side--that they merely need to wait us out and Lebanon will once again be theirs to control.The conflict in Lebanon is not a sideshow in the Middle East, it is the main event. Lebanon is where Tehran intends to fulfill its aspirations to regional hegemony and Shiite dominance. There is too much at stake for Lebanon and for the entire region for the world to leave the Lebanese to the mercies of the radical mullahs in Tehran, the thugs in Damascus and their terrorist allies, Hezbollah.I urge all my colleagues to not only remember Rafiq Hariri and his sacrifice but to speak out in support of the legitimate democratic aspirations of the people of Lebanon. They want only what we enjoy every day--a free, sovereign and democratic state, the servant only of its own people and the master of its own destiny. It's worth fighting for.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank Chairman Berman for his leadership in getting this vitally important resolution to the floor so quickly. It's extremely important that the House be on record telling the brave men and women who fought and died defending Lebanon's independence and sovereignty that America has not forgotten you and will not abandon you.While many in the Middle East, particularly in Lebanon, are trying to make sense of what has happened, I believe that it is critical that they know that the United States and the U.S. Congress still strongly support the democratically elected and legitimate Government of Lebanon, that we will stand behind its efforts to fully restore Lebanon's sovereignty and independence, and that the future of Lebanon is not with Iranian and Syrian sponsored thugs and bullies, but with the decent people of Lebanon of every sect and confession who only want the normal and peaceful life for themselves, for their children, and for their country.Mr. Speaker, just as Hezbollah sucked Lebanon into its conflict with Israel in 2006 by hiding behind its women and children, they have now forced the Lebanese people to endure their war against the Lebanese state. The insurrection by Hezbollah was unjustified, illegitimate, and immoral. No conceivable Lebanese interest was served by it. Only the goals of Iran and Syria were advanced by Hezbollah and its allies' assault on the sovereignty of the Lebanese Government.The pretense that Hezbollah is an authentic Lebanese political actor has fallen away, and in the arrogance of power they have declared their true allegiance. It is not to Lebanon, and it is not even to the Lebanese Shia. Their loyalty is to Iran and Syria, and to the needs and interests of Tehran and Damascus. In their Lebanese puppet state, Ayatollah Khamenei will be the true president and Bashar al-Assad the real prime minister.We have seen this kind of fraud before in the 20th century. The culmination was called the Warsaw Pact. But what was true in Europe in the Cold War remains true today in the Middle East--a captive nation is no true ally of its captor, and no amount of power can make a lie become the truth. And no amount of thuggery, torture, intimidation and murder can make Hezbollah anything other than the terrorist arm of foreign powers and an enemy of Lebanese independence and sovereignty.The United States and every other decent nation must continue to support the Government of Lebanon. The Lebanese Government was democratically elected, it is legitimate, and it deserves our aid. Justice must ultimately be done for those recently and unjustly killed, as well as all those Lebanese murdered for their support of Lebanese sovereignty going back to the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. I have said many times before, and I will keep repeating it, there must be no deal or arrangement that undercuts the Special Tribunal for Lebanon.Mr. Speaker, you either believe that Lebanon is a sovereign and independent state that is to be governed by and for the Lebanese people alone, or you don't. The overwhelming majority of Lebanese, whether they're Sunni, Shia, Maronite, Orthodox, Druse, or any other group, believe in this principle. The entire international community, with the reprehensible exceptions of Syria and Iran, believes in this principle. The United States certainly believes in it. Only Hezbollah, Amal, and the delusional Aounists do not. And that is why Lebanon has suffered and remains in pain today. I'm very proud of the resolution before us today. I strongly urge its adoption by the House.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "title": "CONDEMNING RESTRICTIONS ON FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND WIDESPREAD PRESENCE OF ANTI-SEMITIC MATERIAL IN ARAB MEDIA AND PRESS",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume.Madam Speaker, in January of this year, the Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia held a hearing entitled ``That Which Is Not Obligatory Is Prohibited: Censorship and Incitement in the Arab World.'' We received testimony from three witnesses, one each from Freedom House, the Committee To Protect Journalists, and the Anti-Defamation League. What we heard was not a surprise, but was still shocking. As a result of that hearing, I drafted this resolution and would like to ask all of my colleagues to give it their utmost consideration.It is sad to note that in the 21st century, there is still not one Arab country that can be described as ``free'' by the metrics used by Freedom House, and frankly, by anyone actually familiar with the concept. While there are very significant differences throughout the region in the latitude given to public debate, political argument and press and media freedom, with the notable exception of Israel, not one Arab country can argue that its public square is truly open to all and that their government protects, rather than restricts, that freedom.The ugly and typically stupid hand of the censor is unfortunately not a rare sight in the Middle East. It is not only ubiquitous, it is, in fact, often attached to the arm of the editor, the producer, the copy-writer, or the publisher. According to the United Nations' Arab Human Development reports, while Arab societies have, in general, failed to keep up with other developing nations, in the mechanisms of censorship in the Arab world, they have shown a remarkable degree of institutional adaptation and technological savvy. Their success in stifling debate and narrowing acceptable opinion is all the more remarkable given the frequent failures of Arab bureaucracies in meeting the basic needs of their people for things like education, infrastructure, economic opportunity and clean governance.Countries that can't ensure that their citizens are literate or have clean drinking water still find the resources necessary to operate the red pen of the censor, or the self-serving manipulation of the truth endemic to government-owned, government-controlled and government-operated media. It would be nice if these ugly and ultimately self-defeating practices were merely the problem of other people in faraway places. We could pity them, think gravely about the words of Thomas Jefferson, and bless the wisdom of our Founders who, in a world of despots and danger, saw that a free press and free speech were the indispensable safeguards of our Republic and our liberty.But we don't live in a world that gives us immunity from the troubles of others. Three thousand Americans paid the price for that lesson on September 11, 2001. If we don't visit the world's bad neighborhoods, they will visit us. The fact is, the world has grown smaller, and fair or not, the grievances between the peoples of the Middle East and their governments can be, and often are, attributed to the United States. We saw this phenomena metastasize in Iran in the late 1970s. And we've heard the same complaints explicitly from al Qaeda's leaders. As a nation with vital national interests in that region, we have wisely built strong ties with the governments of almost all of the Arab States.Unfortunately, while these ties have brought greater stability to the region, they have also aligned us with governments that don't share our values when it comes to political and civil human rights. Don't think for a moment that the people of these countries have not noticed. The United States speaks constantly of freedom, but is the ally of authoritarians. The United States prizes and celebrates the first amendment to our Constitution, but is in league with nations that abuse and imprison journalists. The United States uses taxpayer money to train others in the rule of law, but also works hand in glove with security forces of other governments that not only sniff out and destroy terrorists, but often do likewise to their own civil leaders and political reformers.Like it or not, we are entangled in the conflicts between Arab publics and their governments. It is not our role nor our duty to choose the form of government for any people but ourselves.But that does not forbid or restrict our right, and I would say our obligation, to speak out for the values that we believe are universal, including speaking out to our friends who sometimes believe that their extensive cooperation entitles them not only to our understanding and support, but our silence. I don't agree, and I don't accept such a formulation. In the end, such an approach will produce neither stability for them nor security for ourselves.As a nation that has strayed badly over the past several years from our own ideals, we have an obligation to be humble and circumspect in condemning others. Much of the credibility America used to enjoy when speaking out on human rights has been squandered by short-sighted and morally debilitated agents of fear. But we are still a nation of ideas and a people dedicated to certain universal values, that all people are created equal, that the rule of law and due process are not luxuries but fundamental human rights, and that the freedom of speech, conscience, association and the press are not gifts from governments or rulers, but the shared inheritance of all humanity.Moreover, for purely selfish reasons, we have ample cause to be concerned. Many of the same Arab governments which we are turning to help stabilize the region, and in particular, to help resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, are the very same governments that, with a wink and a nod, are helping stir the pot of bitterness and discontent among their own citizens.For example, Arab governments that say small steps toward normalizing relations with Israel are too hard because of public opinion often use government-owned, government-sanctioned or government-controlled press and media to disseminate stories of imaginary Israeli massacres, Jewish blood-libels, alleged Israeli medical experiments on Palestinian children, and for bigots with a taste for history, cheap Arabic-language translations of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and Mein Kempf.Moreover, in many Arab countries while there is ruthless and effective censorship, especially concerning political expression, somehow publication of vicious anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial and even incitement to violence against Jews is allowed.These things are bad enough, but in a place where the press is not free and where there are rules for what you can and cannot say, the fact that these forms of hatred-speech are not prohibited indicates an obvious and dangerous form of state endorsement. In the end, the outcome is a public that is not only less open to peace, but is less ready to engage with the modern world.The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a violent one, and the news about it inevitably reflects that fact. Likewise, revolving the core issues of that conflict does not depend on a free and honest press in the Arab world. And no state and no government is or should be above correction, criticism and complaint, not the United States, not Israel, not anyone. And to state the blindly obvious, criticism of Israeli policy is not, by definition, anti-Semitic.But there is also no question that the cumulative weight of unreasoned and incendiary hatred toward Israel or the Jewish people which has not only been allowed but in some cases inserted into the press and media by Arab governments or their proxies has made the Middle East more violent and more dangerous.The resolution before us will not solve these problems. But it will send a message. We are not a nation capable of indifference to either hate or oppression. We have interests in the Middle East beyond oil, and expanding the scope of human freedom is one of them. We may have strayed from our ideals, but we are trying to come home.Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their support in bringing this resolution before the House, and I urge all of our Members to support the motion and the underlying resolution.I would reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume.Madam Speaker, this resolution pays homage to the lives lost on the 11th of September in 2001 and recognizes this anniversary as a time of solemn commemoration. It extends deepest condolences to the friends, families and loved ones of the innocent victims of the terrorist attacks; it expresses gratitude to the leaders and citizens of other countries who assisted, supported, and stood by the United States in the aftermath of the attacks; and it honors the Nation's first responders, Armed Forces and others whose valiant efforts are a credit to their country and who continue to keep us safe.Each of us remembers exactly where we were on 9/11 when we heard the tragic news. We remember the days of unity that followed when we acted together to protect this country from those determined to harm us and undermine our way of life.Last year, we took a major step in furtherance of that goal by enacting, with bipartisan support, legislation to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, in both its domestic and foreign policy dimensions. By doing so, we addressed major security vulnerabilities and improved our homeland security across the board. I call on the President to continue his work to fully implement that act.Al Qaeda remains a serious threat to the United States. In particular, the al Qaeda leadership that was responsible for ordering the attacks on September 11 has been reconstituted in the tribal areas of Pakistan. From that safe haven, they continue to pose danger to the world and increasingly threaten American troops in Afghanistan.And this is more than just a military campaign. In the battle against extremists, ideas matter as much as ammunition, and this Nation must employ its soft power--its moral, economic, financial, diplomatic and cultural resources--to the very fullest.The global realities of the 21st century require us to use the full range of nonmilitary tools as a fundamental pillar of our national security. We in Congress must support full funding for our international affairs programs. They bolster our national security by allowing us to work with foreign partners to track down terrorists overseas, to secure dangerous weapons wherever they are found, and to help stabilize fragile states.Madam Speaker, this country is in the midst of a competitive election campaign. The stakes could not be higher. But today we set aside all of that to remember what unites us is greater than that which divides us. We all love our country and seek to keep it safe in these perilous times.Madam Speaker, none of us will forget what happened 7 years ago today. We will always remember the victims of 9/11 and the loved ones who survived them. We still have unfinished work. Congress still needs to act, and hopefully soon, to provide the care to the people who rushed to Ground Zero to help others, as well as the thousands who worked on the ``pile'' in the aftermath to rebuild the site.We owe those heroes of 9/11 the care and compensation they deserve. We will always honor the first responders who lost their lives that day--and those in uniform who risk their lives today and every day to defend America.Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, a very thoughtful general once observed that the loss of 1,000 lives is a statistic, but the loss of one life was a tragedy. There were thousands of tragedies that occurred 7 years ago today. I want to talk about one of them.It was a very long week here in Washington, that week of 9/11. It took three or four times the usual time for me to get back to New York. It was late at night. I was able to get a cab in New York to take me down to the World Trade Center, to the pier where they had set up all of the emergency work. I went there at that hour to find my wife, who was a mental health worker, one of those people who were asked to come down and volunteer.As I waited for her to do the things that she and so many other people were doing, I walked around. There was a long, huge wall with pictures on 8\\1/2\\ by 11, on napkins, on flyers that were drawn up, people who had pictures of their loved ones, their husbands, their wives, their children, if anybody saw them.There were firemen walking around trying to console women who did not know yet if they were widows.There were little dolls alongside the wall on the floor stretching for two blocks along this pier. They all had notes on them. They were from children who suffered the loss of parents in the Murrah Building disaster. And these notes all said things like, ``When I was in trouble and frightened, someone gave me this doll to make me feel better. I send it to you and hope that you feel better.''A fire chief came over to me and asked me if I would go over and just stand by this gentleman who was all alone at the wall. It was probably midnight. And this fellow in unique garb, he was a Hassidic Jew, dressed in the traditional big brim black hat, looking very much like the Amish do with the long black coat, he stood in front of one flyer without blinking. The only thing he did was move back and forth, back and forth, staring at this picture.I just stood next to him. And after a minute he spoke to me, without even looking at me, just staring at the picture on this flyer that looked like a younger version of himself, and he said, ``That was my brother.'' He, I was told, was there every night doing this. ``He was my brother. He called me to say good-bye.''``I told him,'' he said, ``that he had to get out of that building. He had to get out right away.'' And he said to me, ``I'm sitting holding hands with the young man who works in the cubicle next to mine, a young Puerto Rican kid who lives in a wheelchair, and there is no way for him to get out of this building. I told him he would not die alone, and I am just calling to say good-bye.''There is nothing anyone could say, nothing I could say. I just stood there.There are thousands of stories, there are thousands of lives, there are tens of thousands of people who were immediately impacted by relatives who died that day, who are heroes as well, some of whom knowingly, some of whom unknowingly went to their deaths, in addition to all of those who rushed into the building to save those that they could.As we remember the first responders, as we remember the people who dug in that pile for so many days and weeks and months, risking their own lives, putting their health at risk and danger, as we know today, an issue that still has to be addressed, we remember also those who caused all of that anguish and pain, all of those thousands of tragedies, who changed history in that one incident, and rededicate ourselves to not being only strong, but smart, as we confront those threats and honor the memory of all those who were lost and all those who tried to help on that day.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3\\1/2\\ minutes.Mr. Speaker, in considering this bill, this package of sanctions and divestment authorities for states and localities, we should keep foremost in our minds we are in a race. I am not referring to our upcoming elections, but rather the race between the civilized world and the nuclear ambitions of Iran.One of us will win, and one will lose. If the world wins, Iran will not become a nuclear weapons state, there will not be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty will not collapse. If Iran wins, the chief sponsor of terrorism in the Middle East, the patron of Hamas and Hezbollah, a hegemonic nation led by fanatical religious zealots will be able to threaten the global economy and the security of the United States and the civilized world from behind a nuclear shield.And we are just about to lose this race. Iran is not only ahead, it is sprinting to the finish. Its proliferation potential is now a simple math problem. Iran is now producing 2.5 kilograms of low-enriched uranium per day, and has produced an estimated 200 to 250 kilograms of LEU just since this past May.For a crash bomb program, Iran could use the LEU as feedstock, dramatically shortening the time to produce nuclear weapons grade uranium. With 700 to 800 kilograms of LEU set into centrifuges, Iran could produce the 20 to 25 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium required for a crude atomic bomb. Other estimates suggest that 1,000 to 1,700 kilograms of LEU would be necessary. Regardless of whether it is 700 or 1,700 kilograms, Iranian proliferation is no longer a question of if, but when.The President has known about this threat since day one. He has known, and done next to nothing. The Bush administration has adamantly refused to use existing U.S. sanction laws against foreign companies investing in Iran's oil sector. But far worse, the Bush administration has actively worked to stop Congress from adopting the tough and necessary legislation that we have before us today.Why? Do they believe that the past 5 years of slow motion, U.S.-in-the-back-seat diplomacy is about to make a huge breakthrough? In the light of Russia's recent announcement that they have no intention of supporting additional UN Security Council sanctions in Iran, I would like someone to explain how this huge breakthrough is supposed to happen.With our administration tied up in an ideological knot, opposed to U.S. sanctions and unwilling to engage effectively itself, the question for Congress is what can we do to stop Iran. With so little time, our thinking on this problem needs to change. Options that years ago may have seemed reckless, like sanctioning firms in allied countries and applying unilateral economic levers, now have been become essential if we are going to be successful in peacefully getting Iran to back down.Likewise, continuing doggedly with the current take-no-chances, small-carrots-and-no-sticks diplomacy which the Bush administration has insisted on, today looks like a roadmap to disaster.Iranian proliferation is mere months away. That fact makes what is feckless, by definition, reckless. I am not calling for another war. I do not want air strikes or a blockade. I want to avoid all that. But if we don't want war, and we really don't want a nuclear Iran, then we have an obligation to use every peaceful, diplomatic, political and economic weapon at our disposal. If you don't want bombs, then you have to have an alternative, and that is sanctions. Abjuring sanctions is a de facto call to those who want arms.I am very grateful to Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their efforts in bringing this critical package of sanctions of legislation to the floor today. It deserves the enthusiastic support of every Member of the House, and there isn't a moment to lose.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7081, the United States-India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act.Today, the House will consider the culmination of 3 years of difficult work in Washington and New Delhi and take the final step to fashion a new policy toward India, one that reflects the realities of the 21st century and acknowledges India's emergence onto the world stage.The bill before us will give Congressional approval to civil nuclear cooperation with India. Let me tell you what that means. It means that the IAEA will be able to inspect two-thirds of India's civilian nuclear facilities, because those facilities will be under IAEA safeguards and all future civilian nuclear facilities will also be under safeguards. It means that India, for the first time ever, has committed to MTCR guidelines. It means that India, for the first time ever, will adhere to Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines. It means that India and the IAEA are making substantial progress toward an Additional Protocol. It means that India is committed to working with us to conclude a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty. It means that we can send a clear message to nuclear rogue states about how to behave, because it shows that responsible nuclear powers are welcomed by the international community not sanctioned; and it means that we can finally achieve the broad, deep and enduring strategic relationship with India, that all of us in this House support. So if you wanted all these things 2 years ago when we established this process, then you are for this bill now.Some Members have expressed concern that the agreement with India doesn't go far enough, that it doesn't rollback India's nuclear weapons program, that it doesn't include all of India's nuclear facilities, and that it sends the wrong message to rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea.For 30 years Mr. Speaker, U.S. policy toward India has been defined and constrained by our insistence on punishing India for its sovereign decision not to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Truth be told, had India conducted its nuclear tests earlier, it would have been treated like China, Russia, France, Britain, and the United States: In short, as a grandfathered member of the nuclear weapons club. But they did not and nothing we have tried over the last 3 decades has convinced them to give up their nuclear weapons. And nothing we say over the next 3 decades will convince them either. India is a responsible nuclear power and deserves to be treated that way. The bill before us does just that.Critics have expressed concerns regarding the agreement's impact on our nonproliferation policy and clearly Iran, Pakistan, and North Korea are all looking for clues about what this deal means for them and their nuclear programs. I think the message is clear: If you want to be treated like India, be like India. Be a responsible international actor with regard to WMD technologies, don't sell your nuclear technologies to the highest bidder, don't provide it to terrorists, be a democracy, a real democracy, and work with us on important foreign policy objectives not against us. That's the message we send today.Does it warm your heart and make you comfortable that Iran and North Korea signed the NPT and are now running away from their freely accepted obligations and away from IAEA inspections?True, India did not sign the NPT yet it is embracing the IAEA, embracing global nonproliferation norms and is a democracy. India's attitude should be recognized and commended.There are two options before us today. One is to throw away all the work that has been done since July 2005 and keep the status quo. India will pursue its national interests as it has been doing outside the nonproliferation mainstream and we inspect nothing. The other is to make the deal with India and get for the United States and the international community a window in perpetuity into two-thirds of India's existing nuclear facilities and all of its future civilian nuclear facilities.I think the choice is clear. This bill before us brings India into the nonproliferation mainstream and gets the United States and the international community access to India's civilian nuclear facilities.Mr. Speaker, it is time for a 21st century policy towards India, one that supports and encourages India's emergence as a responsible global power and solidifies the United States-India bilateral relationship for decades to come. The bill before us today is that new policy. Vote yes on H.R. 7081.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Rohit T. Aggarwala, the Director of New York City's Office of Long-term Planning and Sustainability, within New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's Office of Operations, for receiving the prestigious ``Friend of the Environment Award'' from the Alley Pond Environmental Center (APEC) on November 13th, 2008. APEC, located in Douglaston, Queens, is a superb educational center committed to environmental understanding and awareness. Rit, as he is known by his friends and colleagues, is at the forefront of Mayor Bloomberg's PlaNYC initiative, a sweeping sustainability plan for New York City's future.A native of New York City, Dr. Aggarwala holds a BA, MBA, and PhD from Columbia University, as well as an MA from Queen's College in Ontario. Prior to joining the City government, Dr. Aggarwala worked at the Federal Railroad Administration, and currently chairs a subcommittee at the Transportation Research Board, which is part of the National Academy of Science. He is the author of several articles about transportation policy and about the history of New York City.Under Rit's leadership as Director, New York City's Office of Long-term Planning and Sustainability is implementing a long-term sustainability plan to ensure New York City's continued prosperity, growth, and health. On Earth Day, 2007 the Mayor's Office of Long Term Planning and Sustainability released PIaNYC, which included 127 separate initiatives to protect New York's future, including: housing an additional 1 million New Yorkers affordably; increasing access to parks, playgrounds and open spaces; reclaiming brownfields; developing critical backup systems for the aging water network to ensure reliability; providing additional reliable power sources and upgrading existing power plants; and reducing water pollution so we can open the City's amazing waterways for recreation.Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in commending Dr. Aggarwala and New York City's Office of Long-term Planning and Sustainability for all of its hard work and dedication promoting sound environmental building practices, and for helping New York City lead the world as a Green global citizen.",

    "title": "CONGRATULATING THOMAS SANTIAGO ON RECEIVING THE ``GREEN LIVING AWARD''",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Thomas Santiago for receiving the prestigious ``Green Living Award'' from the Alley Pond Environmental Center, APEC, on November 13, 2008. APEC, located in Douglaston, Queens, is a superb educational center committed to environmental understanding and awareness. Tom's commitment to using environmentally-friendly green building techniques and protocols for Citigroup's new office tower in Long Island City is a truly groundbreaking example of ``green living'' in an urban environment and is truly worthy of public notice and praise.In his role as the Managing Director of real estate for Citigroup in the Northeast U.S., Tom was the driving force behind Two Court Square, Citigroup's second 1.5 million square foot tower in Long Island City. The building is Citi's first ever Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, LEED, Gold certified green building, the national benchmark for rating green buildings. Two Court Square serves as the ``green'' model for corporate America, not only for being environmentally responsible, but also for demonstrating the economic value of money-saving ``green'' building technologies and materials.Under Tom's leadership, Two Court Square is LEED Gold certified because it meets or exceeds stringent criteria in five categories: Sustainable Sites, Energy and Atmosphere, Water Efficiency, Indoor Environmental Quality and Materials and Resources. Some of the amazing environmentally-friendly innovations include: Electricity requirements are met by the purchase of 100 percent wind-power energy; over half the wood used in construction did not originate from logging; low-emitting volatile organic compound materials are used for paint and adhesives; 90 percent of its structural steel contains post-consumer content; 2 million gallons of water annually are saved by recycling rainwater for building cooling and through the use of low flow plumbing fixtures; and the carpet uses backing made from recycled soda bottles. This kind of top-to-bottom environmental sensitivity is where our Nation and our planet's future lies.I would also like to acknowledge APEC's leadership in environmental education and awareness. Every year, over 35,000 school students from all over New York City and Long Island visit Alley Pond Park. At APEC-run programs, students of pre-school, elementary school, middle and high school ages learn about the environment and conservation policy. APEC also runs wonderful teacher workshops to educate teachers in methods to enrich and improve their natural sciences curriculum when they return to the classroom. APEC restored and reclaimed Alley Pond Park in the 1970s as a refuge where New Yorkers could experience nature, wetlands and woodlands first hand. APEC features live animal exhibits and several miles of trails in both wetland and woodland areas, bird walks, nature hikes, craft sessions and workshops on environmental topics. Through the ``Green Living Award'', APEC continues its environmental mission by recognizing the ``green'' achievements of individuals throughout the New York area.Madam Speaker, I am delighted to recognize Tom Santiago for his exemplary work in green building construction and for receiving the ``Green Living Award'' from the Alley Pond Environmental Center. I know my colleagues in the House of Representatives will join me in congratulating Thomas Santiago and his colleagues at Citigroup for this well-deserved honor.",

    "title": "CELEBRATING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF DR. ROBERT J. SMITHDAS",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of an outstanding humanitarian, Dr. Robert J. Smithdas, whose personal accomplishments and dedication to the U.S. deaf-blind community are truly remarkable. Dr. Smithdas is retiring as director of Community Education at the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults, HKNC, after many years of dedicated service.Having contracted meningitis at the age of four, Dr. Smithdas eventually suffered a total loss of both vision and hearing. With great determination, he embraced educational opportunities at the Western Pennsylvania School for the Blind and the Perkins School for the Blind. Assisted by individualized instruction and speech therapy, Dr. Smithdas thrived in scholastics, earning an average of 98.6. After graduating in 1945, he was accepted to the Industrial Home for the Blind, IHB, and earned a fellowship to St. John's University in New York. Dr. Smithdas earned his BA cum laude in 1950 and later attended New York University, where he became the first deaf-blind individual to earn a master's degree. Dr. Smithdas also earned honorary doctoral degrees from Gallaudet University, Western Michigan University, Mount Aloysius College, and St. John's University. Dr. Smithdas' commitment to education prepared him for his lifelong service to the deaf-blind community. Having worked in several management capacities at IHB, Dr. Smithdas played a crucial role in offering the kind of rehabilitative services necessary to expand the horizons of succeeding generations of deaf-blind individuals, including the development of appropriate legislation. With Helen Keller herself and deaf-blind community advocate Peter Salmon, Dr. Smithdas played a vital role in helping to enact the Vocational Rehabilitation Act, which sanctioned the creation of the Helen Keller National Center.Leading by example, Dr. Smithdas has demonstrated that with rehabilitative training, deaf-blind individuals can be active members of our society, and that they have much to contribute. Dr. Smithdas' numerous national awards and achievements include being named both The Poetry Society of America's ``Poet of the Year'' and ``The Handicapped American of the Year'' by the President's Committee on Employment of People Who Are Disabled, as well as being inducted into the National Hall of Fame for Persons with Disabilities.Dr. Smithdas' impact on the lives of the deaf-blind--both those he has met and those who have just benefitted from his good works--is truly immeasurable. And those who have had the privilege to read his works, attend his lectures, and take advantage of the programs he developed know that he is a truly exceptional American. I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to please join me in honoring and thanking Dr. Robert J. Smithdas for his lifetime of dedication to the American deaf-blind community.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 84, honoring the heroic actions of the pilot, crew, and rescuers of US Airways Flight 1549.Madam Speaker, a jetliner, floating in the Hudson River in New York City, on a cold, January afternoon, was an incredible image. More incredible was that no lives were lost when Flight 1549 was forced to land on the river after running into a flock of birds. Through the steady skill and quick thinking of Captain Chesley B. Sullenberger III, First Officer Jeffrey B. Skiles, and the entire flight crew of Flight 1549, serious injuries and fatalities were averted. Their professionalism and unflappability enabled them to overcome the direst of circumstances on January 15, 2009. Pilots Sullenberger and Skiles adeptly landed their crippled aircraft on a busy and churning river. Flight crew members Sheila Dail, Doreen Welsh, and Donna Dent calmly and efficiently made it possible for all of the 150 passengers to exit the plane without major incident.Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, New Yorkers are no strangers to tragedy. I commend the flotilla of commercial and civil watercraft that so swiftly reacted to assist the passengers and crew. Once again, New Yorkers went, without hesitation, to the scene of an emergency without thought for their own safety. In addition, the first responders of the New York Police Department, Fire Department of New York, and of course, the U.S. Coast Guard, skillfully and quickly were able to come to the aid of Flight 1549. Their actions made it possible for the crew and passengers to escape any harm after leaving the plane.Madam Speaker, I ask that we all extend our deepest gratitude to the crew of Flight 1549, the first responders and those individuals who rushed to the scene. I strongly support H. Res. 84 and I urge all of my colleagues to also support this resolution.",

    "text": "I thank the chairman.Madam Speaker, my colleagues, I spent Sunday in Sderot with Mayor Bloomberg of New York. We were being briefed by some people on the Israeli side of the border with Gaza when suddenly, after 14 missiles had already fallen that morning before we got there, the sirens started screaming, and we were rushed and told we had 20 seconds to get into a fallout shelter before the missile hit, rather petrifying.I cannot imagine what I would have done had I children out on the street, as happens each and every day, sometimes hourly in that little town, trying to live peacefully across the border from its neighbor.I listened very, very carefully to our colleagues, especially to the gentleman from Ohio, who has run twice on our side for the Presidency of the United States, and the gentleman from Texas, who ran twice for the Presidency of the United States on the other side of the aisle, and I was wondering, had they become President, either of them, and God forbid our country was struck by missiles, and they had taken the oath to defend our country, how many missiles would have had to have fallen before we struck back?Countries have rights to defend themselves. It is not just one missile or two missiles or three missiles. From the beginning of this decade, each year over 1,000 missiles have been launched from Gaza on Israel. Thousands of missiles. And yet they have held their strength, they have held their warnings that they issued, with the patience of Job. A country that was founded to protect the lives of Jews from destruction and annihilation after World War II held its calm, held itself together, until the missiles started falling 50 a day, 80 a day, 100 a day. And they warned the Palestinians that they would strike back, and they have, as is their right, as is their responsibility to their citizens.We are all upset at the loss of innocent lives in this altercation and any altercation. But, you know, it reminds me of my two boys when they were growing up and they would get in a little hassle with each other, and I would separate them and say, Who started this? And Ari would say, Corey hit me back first.If you don't want to be hit back, don't hit. That is the message. Israel has the right to defend itself, and we stand with Israel as it exercises that right to live in peace with its neighbors.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, about thirty years ago, when diplomacy did not have to be reintroduced as a fresh new approach to our national security, the United States helped bring Egypt and Israel together to make peace.Israel at the time was anything but a regional power. Though it had survived wars in 1948, 1956, 1967 and, with enormous U.S. aid, in 1973, it was isolated and, frankly, right to be concerned for its continued survival. Egypt, the clear leader among the Arab states, had a new leadership that was prepared to make a sharp and unmistakable break with its past policies and re-align its future toward peace and prosperity.The wreckage and slaughter of the 1973 Yom Kippur war, unlike all the preceding wars, thus produced fertile ground for American diplomacy. With bold, strong leaders in both Egypt and Israel who were not only ready for peace, but ready to make the sacrifices necessary to achieve it, the Camp David Accords were signed on September 17, 1978.Since then the Middle East has been a very different place, clearly a much better one for ourselves and, I would argue, even more so for Egypt and for Israel. From our perspective, the peace made at Camp David has linked the two most important militaries in the region to the goodwill of the United States; it has prevented any further Arab-Israeli state-to-state conflicts, though the problem of non-state proxies has grown. And, most importantly, the peace between Israel and Egypt shifted the political center of gravity in the region toward peace with Israel, versus the prior consensus for continual war against the Jewish State.This point can not be overemphasized. But for the peace between Israel and Egypt we might still be fighting against the Arab League's ``Three No's'': no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, and no negotiations with Israel. If this policy sounds familiar, it's because it is still the policy of Iran and the terrorist groups it supports, Hamas and Hizballah.The Camp David Accords not only cemented America's role as the architect of any future Arab-Israeli peace, but obliterated the ``Three No's,'' a defeat that extremists have been struggling to reverse ever since. For Egypt, the peace made at Camp David freed their nation to pursue economic and social development without the continual intrusion and disruption of war. Israel, which had never before in its entire existence had even one completely peaceful and quiet border, probably gained the most. For ourselves, the total cost of 30 years of peace forged at Camp David is about $150 billion, which is a lot of money. But, by comparison, that same $150 billion buys 1\\1/4\\ years of war in Iraq.Unfortunately, over time, Americans, Egyptians and Israelis have all lost sight of the singular importance of the peace made at Camp David, and the massive strategic benefits each nation has silently accrued as a consequence every day since. This oversight is more than just a shame, it is a strategic risk.Each nation has its complaints with the others, and these are not trivial, nor imagined. Over time it is easy for us as human beings to take each other for granted, and the same can be said about the relationships between nations. But in the Middle East today, the risks are too great to allow this pattern to persist in the trilateral relationship. The security of all three nations depends on our re-remembering what made peace so important thirty years ago.",

Since 1979, the TRA's clarity of purpose as the framer of U.S.-Taiwan relations and its singular role in shaping our relationship with the Peoples Republic of China has few equals in terms of foreign policy legislation produced by the Congress. Under the TRA, Taiwan, and I dare say the mainland, have both prospered and are vastly different places from what they were before the TRA was enacted. The TRA has facilitated Taiwan's evolution into a full-fledged, multiparty democracy with a robust free market economy. And as Taiwan has evolved domestically, its role internationally has changed as well. Taiwan is an active participant in addressing transnational threats and has been deeply engaged in humanitarian relief efforts, addressing public health and environmental protection initiative as well as financial stabilization efforts. The resolution before the subcommittee today reaffirms the unwavering support of the United States Congress for Taiwan, its democratic institutions, and urges a deeper and stronger relationship between the United States and Taiwan. These are sentiments with which we can all agree, so I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.",

In her numerous roles in the field of education, President Kenny has demonstrated her commitment to the principle that education remains the key to breaking down our own economic barriers and to securing our nation's standing in the world. I commend President Kenny for her commitment to public education and dedication to the egalitarian notion that a higher education should be affordable and accessible to all. This commitment is in the finest traditions of Stony Brook University and the State University of New York system as a whole.In 1994, President Kenny began her tenure as the first woman President of the University. Since that time, Stony Brook has experienced a renaissance with expansions in the opportunities it provides across the board: from Division I Athletics to major improvements to the Stony Brook University Medical Center. During her presidency, enrollment has increased from 17,500 to more than 23,000, faculty numbers are up 8 percent, and demand for a Stony Brook University education has increased exponentially. With President Kenny's leadership, Stony Brook University has undertaken major construction projects, including the Charles B. Wang Center, a Stony Brook Manhattan campus, the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics, new buildings for Life Sciences, Humanities, and Engineering, and most recently, the Stony Brook University Southampton campus.Concerned about our nation's educational system as a whole, President Kenny has been a leader for national reform. She launched and chaired the Boyer Commission on Educating Undergraduates in the Research University, which produced a report advocating a dynamic model of education that would engage students and inspire them to conduct research consistent with the unique resources of each institution. She has served as Chair of the Association for American Colleges and Universities, and as a board member of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.President Kenny's impact on countless numbers of students, to whom she has dedicated her life and work, is immeasurable. For her selfless dedication to her students and commitment to advancing education for all, I ask all my colleagues in the House to please join me in honoring President Shirley Strum Kenny.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the Village of Kensington on the occasion of its centennial. As one of New York's most unique and historic communities, Kensington is a quiet treasure on the North Shore of Long Island. With its beautiful green space, stylish architecture, and warm-hearted residents, Kensington has become synonymous with pleasant living.The original vision for a ``planned colony'' on Long Island which would become Kensington, was the brainchild of the President of Aetna Bank in New York, Charles Finlay, and his partner, E.J. Rickert. With the farmland they purchased, Mr. Finlay and Mr. Rickert envisioned a community of spectacular homes amidst natural beauty, while maintaining proximity to the local railroad station. Their vision became a reality when in February 1909, the Kensington Association was created to organize Village improvements, including roads, landscaping, utilities, pool facilities, and walkways.Rickert and Finlay built Kensington's famous white gates, modeled from those of London's Kensington Gardens, and named the Village after its new landmark. Improvements to Kensington continued, while honoring Rickert's and Finlay's vision for maintaining the natural beauty of the area. By a unanimous vote of Kensington's residents, Kensington became an incorporated village on November 28, 1921.While a lot has changed around Kensington since that time, the Village has remained a wonderful community in which to raise a family and live out the American dream. Despite the hustle and bustle of the worlds' greatest metropolis just a few miles away, Kensington continues to be a community of tranquility. Its welcoming white gates will always symbolize the hospitable nature of its residents. I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to please join me in honoring Mayor Susan Lopatkin, Deputy Mayor Gail Strongwater, Trustees Howard Diamond, Alina Hendler, and Gregory Keller, Village Clerk/Treasurer Arlene Giniger, and all the people of the Village of Kensington on their 100th anniversary.",

    "title": "FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2009",
    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I offer this simple amendment on behalf of myself and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley). This has to do with safety trumping garbage. It has to do with common sense.The City of New York Department of Sanitation has proposed a marine transfer station. These are generally built on the shoreline because trash is compacted there and put on barges and then carted away on the Long Island Sound or the East River or the Hudson River.Of all the shoreline places to build this, would you suspect the one place that would be picked by the Department of Sanitation would be directly opposite one of the biggest active runways, one of the most active runways in the whole United States of America, where planes take off and land approximately every 20 seconds. I'm talking about LaGuardia Airport, the airport with the largest number of flights in New York City.This is an aerial view of the airport. This is LaGuardia Airport's runway. LaGuardia Airport, most people don't know, has only two runways for all of these great number of flights.The garbage plant is planned right over here, opposite the runway, 2,000 feet away. The rules and regulations of the FAA, which is what we're asking for in this amendment to be implemented and utilized, say that you should not put a garbage treatment plant anywhere near the runway protection zone which is currently 2,000 feet away. This is 2,000 feet--less than that--according to this map which we downloaded from Google.There will be a new flight slope plan implemented that the FAA has approved which says it can't be within 2,500 feet. Why would you put a garbage facility, an attractant to birds, less than 2,000 feet away from one of the most active runways?The gentleman from New York (Mr. Hall) requested of the FAA, they declined, and Secretary of Transportation LaHood overruled them and released the number of bird strikes at airports around the country. Last year there were 87 bird strikes at LaGuardia Airport alone.Now, our pilots are good. You might have seen a little news report that said they can even land on water. And indeed, that's what happened when one of our jets was struck by birds.Garbage is an attractant to birds. The FAA rules and recommendations say don't put these things in the runway protection zone. Our amendment simply says to the FAA, you have to follow your own guidelines.Put it anywhere else. There's a political concern here, and the political concern is not a NIMBY concern. This will most likely be in mine or Mr. Crowley's district. It borders both of our districts right now.This site is the least politically damaging to us because it's in a commercial area. Any other place that they will move it will cause us some political concerns. But those political concerns that we will have to suffer if they move this anywhere up and down the coast in either of our districts is not as important to the safety of the flying public.I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "title": "FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEARS 2010 AND 2011",
    "text": "I rise in strong support of H.R. 2410, the Foreign Relations Authorizations Act. And I want to commend our chairman, the gentleman from California, for his commitment to this legislation, which I believe is a reflection of the gentleman's enormous dedication to this institution and its role under the Constitution.For many years, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act has been held hostage to debates about abortion and family planning, to the inability of the other body to get 60 of their Members to agree to anything, and to a general feeling that it just wasn't essential to do. The result has been an insidious decay of the effectiveness of our diplomatic capabilities and our capacity to influence events around the world.Some might ask, what does this have to do with my constituents? Isn't that why we have a strong military to protect us? Isn't that their role? The simple answer is that our diplomats and our development professionals are not a luxury, nor a fancy affectation of power. These are not aristocrats sipping tea while wearing striped pants and ascots. These are people who are on the front line of our defense. Not the Army, not the Navy, not the Air Force, the Marines, or the Coast Guard; it is the Foreign Service that lives always full time out in the ugly and dangerous parts of the world representing our interests, building alliances, monitoring and reporting on events that may affect our security, and helping to defuse crises and tensions before they sometimes burst into armed conflict or war.There is a simple reason that both the Secretary of Defense Gates and Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have repeatedly and passionately insisted on the necessity of rebuilding and strengthening the State Department. It will save the lives of the people for whom they are responsible. It will allow the Armed Forces to avoid conflict. It will shorten conflicts by allowing our military to focus on security, not negotiations, not governance nor development.In this respect, the title of the bill may mislead some. The bill is not about foreign relations; it's really about our national security. Our national security. It's about the safety of this Nation and our ability to protect and advance our interests around the world. Military power is essential. The United States would not be the country that it is if we did not have such an extraordinary military. But our Armed Forces exist chiefly to deter and defend. Whatever the last few years may have suggested, we are not a Nation that believes in starting wars to solve problems nor in the use of force to resolve political conflicts. A strong State Department and revitalized U.S. Agency for International Development are not favors that we do for others. These are institutions that are essential to our national security and our national interests. The bill is, in fact, merely a downpayment on a process of rebuilding that should have begun years ago.So if you want to bring our troops home from Iraq, then you know that Iraqis have to improve their own internal cooperation and performance in their government. Who is supposed to help them with that? If you want to help Afghanistan and get our troops home from there, then you know that that problem is about poppy farming and police corruption that have to be addressed. Who is supposed to help them with that?If you want to prevent Iran's nuclear program from setting off a chain reaction of proliferation, then you know that we're going to need a broad international coalition to stop them. Who's supposed to put it together and keep it together?We can no afford a second-rate diplomatic corps any more than we can tolerate troops who are untrained, ships that are rusting or aircraft that are unmaintained. Our national security is a whole. We can't succeed with our military and fail with our diplomacy and development, and then hope to be safe. It doesn't work.That's what this bill is about: keeping our nation safe. And it deserves the support of every Member.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I want to express my appreciation to the Chairman and to Mr. Pence for the resolution before us. I think it is critical for the House to address the remarkable events that are taking place in Iran.We are seeing a nation--an entire nation--rise up. What is happening in Iran is an inspiration to all of us who believe that there is such a thing as universal human rights.We do not want--and we are not attempting--to choose Iran's rulers. Who rules Iran is a question for the people of Iran. And as we expect all nations to respect our sovereignty, so too must we respect the sovereignty of other nations.But we are not blind. And we must not be mute.We have seen gunfire and truncheons deployed against peaceful protesters and marches. We have followed the wave of repression against activists, reporters, and all forms of communication. We know about the crackdown and arrests of Iranians who call for freedom and reform. We have watched mobs of thuggish enforcers terrorizing students and citizens in their dorms and homes.But we have also watched the unbelievable, quiet courage of millions of Iranians marching, and we have watched their numbers growing every day. We have seen them insist on non-violence in the face of provocation and assault. And we have heard their impatient but persistent call for justice.And this nation knows what that call for justice sounds like. The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote from the Birmingham jail that ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.''Bound up in the revolutionary documents of our founding, and in our Nation's unique role in the struggle for human freedom, is a special responsibility. We have an obligation that the resolution before us answers. We are all witnesses. And we are bound to support the courageous and decent people in Iran who are struggling for their rights and their freedom.This resolution is measured and careful, but meaningful. And it deserves the strong support of every Member.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) for introducing this important resolution that recognizes the historic events in Czechoslovakia in 1989 and enables Congress to reaffirm its strong friendship and support for the people of the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic.Twenty years ago, on November 17, communist riot police broke up a peaceful pro-democracy demonstration in Prague, brutally beating many of the student protesters.Rather than silencing the students, however, these violent reprisals led to an avalanche of protests between November 17 and December 29 that ultimately led to the fall of the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia.In the days after the initial protest, a pro-human rights group, known as Charter 77, united with other groups to become the Civic Forum, a strong voice calling for reform, civil liberties, and rights for all citizens.Led by dissent playwright Vaclav Havel, the Civic Forum succeeded in forcing the communist government to resign, paving the way for Havel's election on December 29 as the President of Czechoslovakia.Known around the world as the Velvet Revolution, these historic events further cemented the collapse of the communist regimes throughout Central and Eastern Europe, and helped to precipitate the end of the Cold War.In June 1990, Czechoslovakia held its first democratic election since 1946, bringing into power its first completely noncommunist government in over 40 years. In the 20 years since these momentous events, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have become strong, vibrant democracies, close NATO allies, and staunch friends of the United States.They continue to contribute to international peace efforts, including by providing troops and assistance under NATO command in Afghanistan.Millions of Americans trace their roots to these two great nations, and the United States is strengthened by their rich cultural heritage and their many significant achievements and contributions.Mr. Speaker, this resolution acknowledges and commemorates the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia 20 years ago this month. It also reaffirms the bonds of friendship and cooperation between the United States and the Czech Republic.I urge all of our colleagues to support this important resolution.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and of the U.S.-India relationship. Next week, the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, will come to Washington for a State visit, and I am pleased that with this resolution, the House will offer him its own welcome.Prime Minister Singh has worked hard to improve our already strong ties and has courageously already taken political risks for our bilateral relationship that few others would venture. But when the Prime Minister put his government and his career on the line, it wasn't for us, though his victory has certainly proved to be to our advantage. No, Prime Minister Singh took his chances for India, for its future and for the fulfillment of that country's enormous potential.And our partnership is built on this foundation: that India's rise as a great power in Asia and as a global player advances critical American interests ranging from the promotion of democracy and democratic values, to improving stability and security throughout all parts of Asia.We do not fear a growing India for one simple reason: India's values are our values. India is a real democracy with real institutions that are subordinate to the rule of law. India, though ready to defend itself, doesn't start wars or harbor terrorists. India, though as fastidious as any state about protecting its sovereignty, can be relied upon to keep its word once committed to a treaty or an international agreement. India struggles to preserve its tradition of religious, cultural, and ethnic pluralism. India safeguards sensitive technologies. India fights terrorism.We do not see ourselves when we look at India, though this Nation has benefited immensely from Indians who have become Americans. India is vastly larger in population, vastly older in history, and vastly more complex culturally with some 2,000 ethnicities and 29 major languages.We do see similarities. We do see a nation committed to lifting itself by its own means. We do see a nation open to the world, and we do see a nation committed to the same vision of peace and security that has guided our own Nation.There are, as to be expected, differences between us. Some of them--and I would note particularly the issue of Iran--are very serious. But as nations committed to a relationship of equals, a relationship of mutual benefit and mutual respect, I believe we can work through our differences and achieve enormous progress in many areas of our mutual concern.I am delighted that Prime Minister Singh, a man who is one in a billion, is returning to the United States, and I am proud of the House today in offering him such a well-deserved and warm welcome.I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 100th birthday of Morris Fein on Saturday, November 28, 2009.Morris Fein is more than a friend; he is an inspiration and a living testament to the American Dream.Frank and Kate Feintuch migrated from Poland and arrived at Ellis Island aboard the Polonia in 1911 with two-year-old Morris. A product of the New York City public school system, Morris began his education at PS 13 and graduated from Stuyesant High School at the age of 16. Becoming the first member in his family to graduate both high school and college, Morris obtained his Bachelors Degree in History from the City College of New York and graduated with a commission as Second Lieutenant of the ROTC.In 1936, Morris met and married Vera Rothman, with whom he celebrated his seventy-second wedding anniversary in 2008 before her passing. Morris and Vera lived in Astoria, Queens, in a one-bedroom apartment. They not only raised their three children--Sheldon, Benjamin and Roselyn--there, but Morris also operated his tax practice from the apartment on the weekends. In 1954, the family moved to a three-bedroom single-family home in Flushing, Queens.To support his family, Morris worked in excess of sixty hours per week, holding at minimum three jobs at any given time. For over 40 years he served as an Investigator/Inspector for the New York State Department of Agriculture, spearheading many investigations of major consequence in the Jewish and secular communities throughout New York State.Through out his life, Morris has always strongly identified with his Jewish heritage. A strong believer in ``giving back'' to the community, he played a vital role in creating and maintaining the Queensborough Hill Jewish Center, a house of worship and education for his community. He served as a member of the Executive Board and Board of Trustees, including President and Treasurer, at the Synagogue. He also served as the long-term Financial Secretary and then President of the Hrubishower Sick & Benevolent Society; and was a member of the Queensborough Hill Synagogues Men's Club.After suffering a hip injury in 2002, Morris and his wife moved to an independent living facility in Huntington Terrace, NY, where he currently resides. A member of the South Huntington Jewish Center in Melville, he serves as President of the ``Residents Board'' at Huntington Terrace/Brandywine Senior Living.Morris will be celebrating his 100th birthday with his children, Sheldon, Benjamin and his wife Judy Sharmat, Roselyn and her husband Edward Rudofsky; with his grandchildren and their spouses, Lee Rudofksy, Gayle Rudofsky, Steven Fein, Leonard Fein, Dr. Samual Sharmat, Soraya, Juliana and Alissa; and with his great grandchildren, Ethan Fein, Jim Fein, and Sophia Sharmat.Madam Speaker, I call on all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to rise and join me now in extending our congratulations to Morris Fein on the grand occasion of his 100th birthday.",

    "title": "OPPOSING ANY ENDORSEMENT OR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS FACT FINDING MISSION ON THE GAZA CONFLICT",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I strongly support the resolution and want to express my deep appreciation to the Chairman, Mr. Berman, and to the Ranking Minority Member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for their efforts to bring this resolution before the House.In April 2009, the U.N. Human Rights Council set up a Commission to condemn Israel. To the surprise of no one, it did exactly that. But for the grave subject matter, the Goldstone report, built heavily on testimony provided under the auspices of Hamas, would be laughable. In the self-righteous fantasyland inhabited by Judge Goldstone and his colleagues, there's no such thing as terrorism; there's no such thing as Hamas (and if it does exist, it's certainly nothing to fear); there's no such thing as legitimate self-defense; and war is like a sporting event, rather than the most ghastly, destructive, chaotic phenomenon we human beings are capable of creating.Had the report been submitted by a group of eager law students or the human rights club on a college campus, I would suggest that their efforts had been unfortunately wasted on the production of a pompous, tendentious, one-sided political diatribe. Notwithstanding all their alleged ``facts'' there's very little truth, and for all the so-called ``context'' they supply, there's very little wisdom.As this diatribe actually carries the imprimatur of a part of the United Nations, there have been--as I feared when the report was first issued--a number of very unfortunate developments all based on the report is being mistaken for a credible piece of work, which it is not. In addition to the wasteful consideration of this thoroughly biased and fatally flawed document in several bodies of the United Nations, the report has also set off yet another round of offensive and sterile Israel-bashing that has brought peace no closer, that has produced no international consensus, and, along the way, that has further sullied and cheapened the reputation of the United Nations and the cause of human rights.Certainly, the United States must do all that it can to ensure that no more time is spent on this distraction from the real work of making peace. The Obama Administration has rightfully denounced the Goldstone Report, which, if it was taken seriously, would make it legally impossible for this country, or any other country, to defend themselves from terrorists who hide behind civilians. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has been forcefully arguing that international community can't possibly expect Israel to exchange ``land for peace'' if, when the peace breaks down, Israel is effectively prohibited from defending itself.First of all, I think Prime Minister Netanyahu is completely right. And second, there's not even the smallest shred of a possibility that the Israeli public would agree to any peace agreement under the absurd operational restrictions that the Goldstone Report proposes to require of Israel's (and every other country's) armed forces.The resolution makes clear the strong view of the House that the Obama Administration must do everything it can to quash the Goldstone report, both to protect our own right of self-defense, and to make clear to the world that they can have Goldstone, or they can have Middle East peace, but they can't have Goldstone and Middle East peace.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the legislation before us. I want to thank Chairman Berman for allowing me to work closely with him on this bill and, more importantly, for his producing such an excellent piece of legislation.Some may be surprised that I am an enthusiastic supporter of this bill to assist Pakistan. Over the years, I have been, unashamedly, one of the most persistent and aggressive critics of Pakistan's government and of the previous administration's policies for dealing with it. I remain deeply concerned about much of Islamabad's behavior, ranging from its cozy relations with native terrorist groups to its obsessive belief that India intends to devour Pakistan. None of Pakistan's governments have demonstrated a persuasive commitment to internal political or economic reform or to anything approaching real acceptance of the rule of law.Pakistan has been, at best, an obstreperous partner on the subject of proliferation, and like many, I fail to understand what possible reason they could have that could justify the stonewalling we've faced regarding the A.Q. Khan proliferation network. I continue to believe that Pakistan's interest in F-16 aircraft is akin to a fetish.Nevertheless, I am a strong supporter of the bill. Why? Very simply, it is time our partnership with Pakistan connects directly to the Pakistani people. Our previous strategy of depending wholly upon the government of Pakistan to fight a war most of its people detest is not sustainable, and I believe it has contributed significantly to the political instability in that country.This bill sets the stage for the United States to work with Pakistan to promote long-term development and infrastructure projects in all areas of Pakistan, to establish a real counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategy and to ensure U.S. access to individuals suspected of engaging in nuclear proliferation. This legislation will help Pakistan gain control of its under-governed areas, and it will ensure accountability for all U.S. assistance to Pakistan.In addition to requiring the President to develop a real security strategy and to regularly report back to Congress on the effectiveness of our military assistance, the act prohibits such assistance until Pakistan demonstrates its commitment to shared security goals. There are also strong oversight and audit requirements for the State Department and for USAID, and there is a requirement for the U.S. Comptroller General to report independently on the effectiveness of our security assistance.This bill is a tremendous step forward for us in our efforts to bring peace and stability to South Asia. I would hope that every Member would support this legislation. I thank the chairman.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the resolution before the House. I want to commend the chairman for his strong efforts particularly on the bill as we adopted it in the House in July. The bill before us today had to satisfy other parties and is, in my view, a lesser product for it.The fundamental question this legislation attempts to answer is: How can we best ensure the full cooperation of the Government and the people of Pakistan in our struggle against al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other sources of violence, terror, and regional instability? In the text authored by Chairman Berman, the answer to this question was to propose a long-term partnership, one in which both sides had both interests and responsibilities, a partnership of equals who were expected to constantly and appropriately judge whether or not the relationship was succeeding.The compromise bill before us today, however, is not a blueprint for a partnership; it is a recipe for disappointment followed by disillusionment.Pakistan is too big and too complex to be a proper subject for the Senate's preferred Pygmalion-like approach. Even if Pakistanis sought such a relationship, which they very definitely do not, Pakistan is simply beyond our shaping.Pakistan's interests and our own are not very closely aligned. We see India as a major ally. They see India as unalterably rapacious and inherently dangerous. We see the Afghan Taliban as a wicked, oppressive, and violent group intent on returning Afghanistan to primitive theocratic darkness. They see it as a useful insurance policy. We see Pakistan's ongoing relationship with radical Islamic terrorist groups as utterly illegitimate. They see these groups as both fundamentally just and as essential leverage. They see it as an unwarranted foreign imposition and potentially a violation of their rights. And the list of contradictions could go on across a range of subjects from madrassas to arms sales, from state enterprise corruption to feudal land reforms.Setting aside the differences we have with the Government of Pakistan, I think we should all be very circumspect about the ability of our own government to carefully spend $1.5 billion a year in Pakistan. The history of our assistance programs with Pakistan does not inspire confidence in either the rectitude of our partners or our own ability to spend the taxpayers' money effectively.The response to such concerns is predictable: Shall we do nothing? No, of course not. Pakistan is a country we can ignore only at our own peril. Only a fool could pretend that what happens there is not and will not become our concern. This bad neighborhood will definitely come to visit us if we choose not to visit it.But our success will depend chiefly on reforms taken in Pakistan by Pakistanis. I see little in the bill to provide any assurance that such changes are on the way. I fear again we are choosing to be Pakistan's patron rather than its partner. In the end, Pakistan will absorb what we offer and remain the same Pakistan, and, worst of all, they will claim once again that we have failed them.But we have no choice but to pass this bill.",

    "title": "DEMOCRACY IS STRENGTHENED BY CASTING LIGHT ON SPENDING IN ELECTIONS ACT",
    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the DISCLOSE Act and offer a very simple but also very important amendment which simply adds the words ``clear and conspicuous'' as a requirement to the disclosures that covered organizations are required to submit to shareholders, members, or donors under the bill.In the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United, corporations now have a First Amendment right to spend millions or even billions of dollars of shareholder money to defeat or support candidates for public political office. While this ruling is now United States law, the DISCLOSE Act takes the appropriate step of mandating that corporations tell their shareholders how they're using the money. After all, investors in a company have a right to know how their company is using their money. But the underlying bill fails to ensure that these corporate disclosures are made clearly and understandably or that they are printed in such a way that allows shareholders to see them.Mr. Chairman, Congress has insisted on disclosure requirements for corporations before, and anyone who receives a credit card offer knows that this is what we get--tiny, unreadable text in 5-point font. Even if you could read it, which you can't without a magnifying glass, you would have to have degrees in law or advanced mathematics to be able to understand it.The central theme of the DISCLOSE Act is empowering American investors by mandating that companies disclose their political expenditures. My amendment very simply imposes and adds the words ``clear and conspicuous'' as a requirement for all organizations covered under the bill so that American investors have a chance to actually see and understand those disclosures. As Congress takes the very reasonable approach of mandating corporate disclosures of political expenditures, we must ensure that corporations present that information clearly and understandably to all of their shareholders.I thank the Rules Committee for making my very straightforward, commonsense amendment in order.I reserve the balance of my time.LUNGREN of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.The CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.LUNGREN of California. Mr. Ackerman's amendment is an interesting amendment because, among other things, it was allowed to be considered on this floor, while any amendment offered by any Republican Member on the committee of jurisdiction was disallowed. We had, on our side, several amendments which would make it clear that the disclosure requirements in this bill are required equally of unions as of corporations.As I listened carefully to Mr. Ackerman's statement concerning his amendment, I noticed he referred only to corporations and to the obligation of corporations to make reports to their shareholders. There was not a single mention of the responsibility of unions to inform their members of how they spend their money in a political way in a ``clear and conspicuous'' manner.He said his amendment is fairly straightforward, almost as if it's unnecessary or so obvious. And yet that amendment was allowed to be in order, but one that would make it clear that his ``clear and conspicuous'' requirement and every other requirement of disclosure contained in this law which would affect corporations of all types--and remember, I'm talking about not just for-profit corporations but corporations of any type--would equally apply to the unions was not allowed. And so the gentleman has made the case that we have been making all along: This bill does not, in fact, treat unions the same as it does other organizations, many of whom, as I say, have a corporate structure but they would not be identified by the average person as a corporation. They'd be identified as an advocacy organization.And so, once again, we see in this amendment an attempt to unbalance the playing field by ensuring that a particular obligation that may be an appropriate obligation with respect to corporations is not placed on unions, once again. And, for that reason, I would have to oppose the gentleman's amendment. But we can't have time to discuss whether unions ought to be dealt with.The argument that the potential corruption is there with contractors would certainly be there with representatives of union member public employees. I'm not saying they're corrupt. What I am saying is the legal analysis is the same. I don't think my friends on the other side of the aisle would suggest that every corporation is corrupt, but it is because of the possibilities of corruption that we're allowed, under the Supreme Court's interpretation of the First Amendment, to have these kinds of disclosure requirements.All I'm saying is, once again, the gentleman's amendment proves the point we've been trying to make on the floor. This bill does not fairly treat everybody. There are those that are favored by the majority and there's the rest of the world. Those favored by the majority get special treatment. Those not favored by the majority do not get that special treatment. It will render this bill unconstitutional, as it should.With that, I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, the purpose of this bill, as I understand it, is for transparency and for people to understand what's happening out there as people spend lots of money--other people's money, very often--to advocate for or against candidates. In the case of unions, unions are very transparent in who they're supporting and who they're not supporting when they decide to take that kind of action. Union members pay voluntarily with their dues money, and the unions disclose who they are and who they're supporting.People who invest in corporations, presumably for the purpose of investing money and furthering America's economic and their own economic interest, have a right to know how those corporations are spending their money that they thought was being invested for the purpose of capitalism and free enterprise rather than to be diverted into anybody's personal political agendas. Unions do that because their members vote; corporations do not. And I would have no idea of a corporation that I may invest in, whether they're spending my initial investment money to work against my interests or even your interests--or for them, for that matter. This is just to let people know.The second point, the amendment that I offer covers every organization that is covered under the bill equally.I yield back the balance of my time.The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Ackerman).",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support for the bill and I offer my congratulations to the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and to all my fellow conferees on what is a remarkable piece of legislation.This bill has teeth, real teeth, great big nasty sharp teeth that are finally going to force businesses and banks around the world to choose between access to the American economy and financial system, or business as usual with Iran's theocratic dictatorship.This bill has real sanctions; not maybe sanctions, not sort-a sanctions, real sanctions. This bill has real sanctions investigation requirements; not maybe we'll look into it, not we'll try to get to it when we can, but a clear legal requirement to investigate potential violations. This bill creates legal safe harbor for the potential divestment of billions of dollars of equity from companies that continue to do business in Iran, the world-capital of state-sponsored terrorism. This bill has real sanctions on Iran's energy sector and all the things that keep it alive and allow it to operate. This bill will force new requirements on U.S. banks to keep Iran's blood-tainted money from being laundered by the international financial system.This bill imposes sanctions on those in Iran responsible for human rights violations and those companies that facilitate Iranian state repression. America will not merely bear witness to the brave struggle of the people of Iran to be free; we choose to stand with the Iranian people against the jackboot of the ayatollah's tyranny.This bill will force action to close loopholes abroad that have allowed Iran to import, smuggle and altogether befuddle international efforts to keep dangerous technologies out of their malicious hands. With this bill there will be no more blind eyes for allies; no more sleeping at the export control switch.In short, this is a bill that forces the question: will the world watch passively as Iran crosses the nuclear arms threshold, or will we join together to squeeze, wrangle, coerce, and compel Iran to pull back from the nuclear brink?Iran's nuclear program is the greatest threat to peace and security in the Middle East and throughout the world. We know it. Our allies in Europe know it. Russia and China know it. All the Arab states know it. Successful nuclear proliferation by Iran would likely mean the collapse of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the onset of a mad rush for nuclear arms in the Middle East and a vastly increased possibility of the unimaginable horror of nuclear arms being used.This bill is also a triumph for the Leadership of this Congress and for the Obama Administration. For the entirety of their eight years, the previous Administration talked tough while the Iranian nuclear program went from crawling to walking; from walking to running; and from running to sprinting towards a nuclear bomb. The rhetoric was always very fierce, the results were always very flaccid. The previous Republican-controlled Congresses, though no less aware of the looming danger following the revelation of Iran's uranium enrichment program in 2002, also said all the right things, but somehow--somehow--never got around to passing this bill or one like it.Look at who's in charge today. Look at who is going to get this bill done with broad bipartisan support. Look at who just put Iran's energy sector under the gun. Look at who just closed the investigations loophole and the diversion loophole. Look at who just imposed unprecedented energy, banking, and finance sector sanctions. Look at who just imposed human rights sanctions on Iran's regime of thugs.Look also at who just got Russia and China to join with the international community in passing the toughest ever UN Security Council sanctions on Iran; sanctions that authorize the inspection of Iranian ships; that impose major new restrictions on Iranian banking, finance, shipping, and arms transactions; and that designates the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and key Iranian firms and figures associated with proliferation for additional penalties. Two years ago if someone had suggested the Security Council would have adopted these positions, they would have been taken away in a straitjacket. Today it's reality.The cowboy rhetoric and the contempt for diplomacy are gone. But the results, which are what actually matters, are compelling. Just as we in Congress have come together to pass this historic legislation, the Obama Administration has rallied the world to stand against Iran's nuclear ambitions. Results matter.We can not guarantee the success of these measures. Ultimately, the choice lies with the regime in Tehran to decide what price they're prepared to pay to sustain their illicit nuclear activities. But it should be clear that we are doing all that we can to impose on Iran the highest possible costs for its defiance and that we are demonstrating, by our actions and by our efforts, the depth of our commitment to peacefully ending Iran's illegal nuclear activities.We are trying diplomacy. We are trying unilateral sanctions. We are trying multilateral sanctions. We are trying our utmost to avoid making conflict inevitable. But there should be no question about the absolute determination of the United States to prevent Iran from acquiring the capability to produce nuclear weapons.Iran can not and must not be allowed to cross the threshold of nuclear arms. They can stop their program, or it can be stopped by others. And it would be far, far better if they stopped their nuclear program themselves. The United States and the other P5+1 nations have all made clear the benefits Iran would gain if it made this choice. The United Nations and the Congress today are showing Iran the rising costs and growing isolation it will endure if its behavior doesn't change.Iran's illicit nuclear activities and programs must stop. Above all other considerations, above all other costs, without any doubt or uncertainty, Iran's nuclear arms program must be stopped. It must be stopped.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Howard Weitzman, who served as the Comptroller of Nassau County, New York from 2001 through 2009.When Howard first took office, Nassau County faced an unprecedented budget crisis. Together with the County Executive, Howard brought Nassau County back from the brink of bankruptcy, balanced the county's budget, and turned deficits into surpluses; a feat made more remarkable when considering he engineered Nassau County's fiscal turnaround without a tax increase for three consecutive years.During his eight year tenure, Howard enhanced the reputation of the Comptroller's Office and helped to restore Nassau County residents' trust that their local government worked for their best interests. Under his stewardship, Nassau County recovered millions of dollars for taxpayers by exposing waste, fraud, abuse and misspending by agencies and vendors that did business with the County. He pioneered the launch of the NassauRx Card, an innovative prescription drug discount program that, to this day, provides savings off retail prescription drug prices. To date, the NassauRx Card has saved Nassau residents more, than $12 million.Prior to becoming Comptroller, Howard served as the Mayor of Great Neck Estates, where he and his wife, Susan, have resided for 28 years. He is a Certified Public Account, a former national healthcare partner at KPMG, and the paragon of a true, dedicated public servant. Howard's years of selfless service to his community are exemplary and his many achievements on behalf of Nassau County residents are worthy of recognition. I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to please join me in honoring Howard Weitzman and thanking him for his service.",

This week, Mr. Tshaka will be traveling to Washington, DC to witness his vision realized when Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid will unveil a series of plaques that honor and remember the contributions made by enslaved African Americans during the building of the Capitol. Thanks to his work and perseverance, the United States government will for the first time acknowledge the regrettable, humiliating, embarrassing, and humbling truth that slave labor helped to construct the very building that houses democracy in our Nation's capital.In 2005, a Congressionally mandated study confirmed that slave labor was used extensively in the construction of the Capitol. The study confirmed what Mr. Tshaka already knew: One of the most egregious human rights violations in the history of the modern world helped erect the United States Capitol. It is to Mr. Tshaka's enduring credit that Congress will publicly and permanently recognize this fact this week.Throughout his life, Mr. Tshaka has tirelessly dedicated himself to advocating for civil, minority and community rights. A lifelong resident of New York City, he has contributed immeasurably to the improvement of his community and of his country. While this week's ceremony will be bittersweet, I am pleased that Mr. Tshaka will be present to witness the fulfillment of his latest endeavor to promote civil rights and awareness.I look forward to welcoming Mr. Tshaka to the Capitol for this historic unveiling and I am proud to see Congress recognize the truth behind the Capitol's construction. I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in recognizing Mandingo Tshaka and thank him for helping to make this week's ceremony a reality.",

His work has earned him the deep appreciation not only of strong supporters of the U.S.-Israeli friendship, but also of the State of Israel. I am proud to recognize Mr. Segal and submit a letter from the Israeli Consul General, honoring his exemplary work on behalf of Israel.Dear Mr. Segal, I recently learned from Rabbi Paul Silton of your longstanding commitment and service to the State of Israel and therefore it is my pleasure to extend these heartfelt wishes of mazal tov to you. As the State of Israel celebrates its 62 anniversary, you have had the privilege of watching our small State take root, grow, and blossom before your very eyes. While some easily dismissed its hidden potential and true value, you took every opportunity available to fight for its existence, knowing that the Jewish people had earned the right to return to their homeland. As a foreign correspondent, you used the power of your words to mobilize the American and Canadian communities in support of Israel as we struggled to become a free and democratic state. You served the Jewish people by fighting for our rights in Washington, DC and representing our goals and aspirations to President Truman. You used your political clout and influence to establish ties and build a solid friendship between America and the State of Israel. Your important work to expose Nazi war criminals and to protect the rights of Soviet Jewry depicts the true character of a man who has always put the wellbeing of others at the forefront of his agenda. The foundation you built has lasted for decades, and we are so grateful for all you have done. On behalf of the State of Israel, I thank you for all of your efforts. I have no doubt that even after all these years of service we will be privileged to see many more incredible things from you. Sincerely, Asaf Shariv, Consul General.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution. I want to thank the Chairman and commend Mr. Costa and Mr. Poe for their work on the resolution.The anniversary of the uprising of the Iranian people to secure their democratic rights is a solemn occasion. The images from last year of ordinary Iranians showing unbelievable courage in challenging the ruthless and vicious theocracy that controls Iran resonated powerfully with Americans. Recalling the late 1980s and the collapse of Communism, many have begun to hope that this wholly indigenous movement, by virtue of its own success, and entirely for its own reasons, will throw on to the ash-heap of history the brutal, irresponsible, and vicious regime of the mullahs.I don't think any one believes the current leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran will go quietly or easily into retirement. And I think it would be foolish to assume that a reformed Iranian government would automatically be very friendly to the United States, or be less committed to the pursuit of its own national interests. But there is good reason to think that a different Iranian government, one that was truly answerable to the aspirations of the Iranian people, would transform the politics of the Middle East, dramatically change the global struggle against violent Islamic extremism and, potentially, salvage the global non-proliferation regime.But as we think about how we can aid the Green Movement, I believe we need to be especially careful and thoughtful. There is, unfortunately, a painful history of American intervention in Iranian affairs, and we should, at the very least, have some humility about our ability to competently shape highly politicized and dynamic events in other nations.Iran is a sovereign state whose people are struggling bravely for their own freedom. It is natural and right for us to want to support their struggle. The question is how? It seems to me that our first obligation is ``to do no harm.'' And our second obligation is to recognize that we are not a doctor, and Iran is not a patient.With these caveats, I believe there are some important things that we can and should do; all of which can be done publicly and outside of Iran. First, as we are doing today, we must continue to let the people of Iran know that we have not forgotten them or their struggle for freedom. Second, we must continue to bear witness to vicious crimes the Iranian regime is perpetrating against its own citizens. A government at war with its own citizens is illegitimate by definition. Third, we and other nations truly committed to universal human rights must continue to highlight Iran's absolutely illegitimate and immoral behavior in international forums and in the United Nations. The Iranian regime's behavior can not be denied and it can not be excused.Finally, and most critically, we absolutely must prevent Iran from acquiring the capability to produce nuclear weapons. For the sake of the people in Iran, for the sake of the people in the Middle East, for the sake of our allies in Israel, and for our own vital national security interests, Iran's nuclear ambitions absolutely must not be allowed to succeed.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today, on the thirty-sixth anniversary of Turkey's invasion of Cyprus, to sadly commemorate this tragic event. Turkey's illegal occupation has continued for far too long. After decades of stagnation, the situation in Cyprus demands a just and comprehensive solution.Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have passionately, aggressively, and persistently called for an end to the devastating artificial division of the island of Cyprus. I have been an outspoken critic of Turkey's obstinate belligerence on this issue and a supporter of what seems like countless bills and resolutions pleading, urging, and demanding a just and peaceful resolution.My voice has been just one in a rising chorus of international leaders asking Turkey to end its occupation and help facilitate a solution that is amenable to all Cypriots. Since Turkey's 1974 invasion, numerous United Nations resolutions have condemned Turkey's actions and called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Cyprus. Turkey remains the only nation to recognize the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The consensus of the world community is apparent--Turkey's control over the island's future is unjust and must end.As we and other nations work to forge a path towards a free and unified Cyprus that fulfills the needs of all its citizens, we should give special attention to the refugees who have been yearning to return to their homes in safety. A solution must be found that respects the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and provides to all Cypriots the dignity to which they are entitled. Difficult problems rarely have easy solutions--and Cyprus is no exception. Only a Cypriot state that reflects the needs and consent of all its people will be able to thrive. The international community--including Turkey--must help facilitate this transition. I hope Istanbul will find the political will and courage to at last be part of the solution.Thirty-six years is far too long for this tragedy to continue in search of a solution we know is possible. We who live every day in a nation of different ethnic backgrounds and divergent religious beliefs know coexistence and self-governance is possible, and that pluralism is no pipedream. The citizens of Cyprus yearn for a government of, by, and for the people and deserve it as much as any of us.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 100th anniversary of the Society of the Kastorians ``OMONOIA'' of New York, located in Whitestone.The first Kastorian immigrants, hailing from Kastoria, a North-Western Province in Greece, have deep roots in New York City. After their arrival in 1887, the community quickly grew. These new Americans organized a philanthropic group that has done charitable work and donated resources both in Greece and here in the United States.Founded on August 7, 1910, the Society first began sending aid back to its members' homeland, Kastoria. The first donations supported a girls' school, a pharmacy, and earthquake-recovery efforts. During both World Wars, the Society was active in providing assistance to Greece's infrastructure and its defenses. During those turbulent times, the Society's efforts helped Greece construct a warship, a power plant and a water supply distribution system, as well as providing shipments of flour to Greek refugees.Through the years, the Society's generosity has not been limited to Greece; it has supported many initiatives in New York and throughout the United States. In 1941, the Kastorians purchased $16,000 in U.S. Savings Bonds, and an aircraft was named The Kastorian Spirit in their honor. They have donated to the American Red Cross and have annually given over $50,000 for scholarships. The Kastorians donated to the World Trade Center Fund after the 9/11 attacks, and to Columbia University for its Hellenic Studies and Ancient History program. They also purchased a two-building complex in Whitestone that the Society uses as its headquarters, where cultural lectures and celebrations are hosted.Madam Speaker, for the last hundred years, the Society's members have been able to maintain their heritage and devotion to Greece, while at the same time dedicating themselves to their home in the United States. I look forward to seeing the Society of Kastorians ``OMONOIA'' of New York's future efforts in improving the lives of not only Greek-Americans, but also all Americans, for many more years to come.I ask that my colleagues in the House of Representatives join me, and rise in recognition of the Society of Kastorians, its President, Dr. Elias Panides, its Vice President, Vasili E. Zisis, and all its members, on their centennial anniversary.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of repealing the Department of Defense's misguided, discriminatory ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' (DADT) policy.For 16 years, ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' has placed an unthinkable and immoral burden on gay and lesbian servicemen and women, who, under United States law and unlike their heterosexual counterparts, must hide their sexual orientation from the military. If our Nation is truly to be the land of the free, home of the brave, we must continue to make progress towards equality. Repealing ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' is a crucial step forward.Mr. Speaker, I was contacted by a gay soldier from Long Island who despite serving his country for more than 20 years, despite volunteering to serve in a combat zone to defend America's principles of freedom from tyranny and from persecution, and despite receiving two Bronze Stars for meritorious service to his country, is required by law to lie about who he is or face being discharged from the military. In his letter, he pleads for a repeal of ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell.'' In reality, he is asking nothing more than to be treated exactly the same as other servicemen and women.It is reprehensible that his Nation responds to his service by telling him he needs to ``shut up'' about who he is. Upon disclosing his sexual orientation, would his past 20 years of service be worth less? Would he suddenly be of no value to the military? Is he suddenly no longer a war hero? Is his 20 plus years of service suddenly an embarrassment? The answer of course, is absolutely not. Yet, our Nation's policy tells this soldier he's not desirable as is.Mr. Speaker, it's a contradiction in the first degree. Our military, including this soldier who contacted me, puts their lives on the line to defend American principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Yet, those who defend these principles are themselves discriminated against because of who they are.This is also a self-defeating policy. Since ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' was implemented in 1994, more than 13,000 gay and lesbian service members have been discharged for no other reason than their sexual orientation. As the United States has fought wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq, hundreds of mission-critical troops, including crucial Arabic, Farsi, and other linguists, have been discharged because the Department of Defense believed they were gay. At the same time, the military has increasingly granted moral waivers to recruits with criminal backgrounds.Mr. Speaker, the case is clear. There is no sound argument for maintaining this discriminatory policy. For the thousands of gay servicemen and women who so bravely serve our country every day but who live in constant fear of being discovered for who they are, for the principles of freedom and equality upon which the United States of America was founded, and in the interest of righting a wrong that has persisted for far too long, I rise in strong support of the bill before us and urge my colleagues to join me in honoring all American servicemen and women, regardless of their sexual orientation.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, this resolution is absolutely vital. It should be called the Peace Process Preservation Act because that is exactly what it is all about. I understand that to many Israelis and many Palestinians, there is enormous frustration and disappointment and impatience with the peace process, but there is absolutely no acceptable alternative to it. Only negotiations can promise a real and durable peace, a peace with security for Israel, as a Jewish and democratic state, and independence for a sovereign and viable Palestinian state. There is no magic wand. There is no shortcut. The only way to peace is negotiating in good faith and making the hard choices that it demands.Israel has shown time and again that it is ready. In the year 2000, Israel made a serious and generous offer to the Palestinians at Camp David, and then offered even more at Taba. Israel offered the Palestinians still more in 2008. And last year, Prime Minister Netanyahu, without getting any credit, came out in favor of a two-state solution and has been waiting ever since for the Palestinians to join him at the table.It is time for Abu Mazen to stop jetting around the looking for alternatives to dealing directly with Prime Minister Netanyahu. Palestinians can't, on the one hand, complain that Israeli settlements prejudge final status issues and then run around calling on other nations to try to impose a solution from the outside.Personally, I think that the Palestinians' complaints about settlements are overwrought. Prime Minister Netanyahu froze settlement building for 10 months and got only Palestinian scorn for his efforts. Moreover, for peace, or to promote it, Israel has withdrawn completely from Sinai, Lebanon, and Gaza. So the Israeli track record on land for peace is very clear.But what some Palestinians can't seem to understand is that their legitimate aspirations not only can't be achieved by violence, but are equally unobtainable through unilateral or external declarations. A just and lasting settlement is only possible through a political process, one where both sides make concessions.Any nation that is truly committed to peace, or sees itself as a friend of the Israelis or the Palestinians, has to recognize that trying to dictate a solution is a recipe for catastrophe. Instead of producing peace, efforts to impose one from the outside will transform a difficult but resolvable conflict between two peoples into a horrific war between two religions.So if you think the time to resolve this conflict is now, and I do, and if you think both Israelis and Palestinians are entitled to govern themselves, and I do, then you need to support this resolution in favor of negotiations and peace and against imposed or unilateral solutions.",

That's what happened here: 99.7 percent of us will not be affected by the estate tax, yet a $23 billion bribe to just 6,600 families across the entire country was needed to get those unemployment benefits in the bill. And, we then add the entire cost of the bill, all $860 billion, straight to the deficit.Surely, there are worthwhile provisions in this bill. However, these worthwhile provisions should not be held ransom for tax cuts to the richest taxpayers--$60 billion in tax cuts for them--some $24 billion more than the struggling middle class who've been the hardest hit by the economic downturn. I fully support extending such low and middle-class tax relief such as the child tax credit, marriage penalty relief, the dependent care credit, the earned income tax credit, the student loan interest deduction, and Alternative Minimum Tax relief, among others. But don't tell me I have to vote for giving tax cuts to billionaires for two years when we can't even give our seniors on Social Security $250 for one.Speaking of Social Security, this bill represents the single greatest threat to the program since President Bush wanted to privatize it. This bill requires a $111 billion infusion from general funds into the Social Security Trust Fund to make up the difference for cutting two percent from the employee payroll tax. Next year, if the economy hasn't recovered sufficiently, Congress will not have the stomach to let the tax holiday expire--no Member of Congress will want to ``raise'' payroll taxes by two percent. Any future extension of this tax holiday necessarily means that Social Security will compete with other federal programs, such as veterans, medical research, and defense, for its funding. This dangerous precedent means that Social Security's dedicated funding, payroll taxes, is under attack. This opens the door to means testing and benefit cuts for beneficiaries. Make no mistake, Social Security's opponents will be enticed to move in for the kill by moving to privatize the program.I don't oppose extending the middle-class tax cuts for 98 percent or 99 percent of taxpayers. In fact, before this compromise was struck, I supported raising the threshold from $250,000 to something more reasonable, such as $400,000, because where my constituents live there is a much higher cost of living than in other parts of the country. However, to hold extending those middle-class tax cuts hostage to pass a bill that will cost more than TARP, more than the stimulus, and add $860 billion to the national debt, is not acceptable.Mr. Chair, it's hard to climb the ladder of prosperity if the middle rungs are missing. This bill does nothing to restore those middle rungs; instead, by giving the most to those who need it the least, it perpetuates the failed thinking that somehow the rest of us will benefit. I for one won't pay this ransom--my vote--for a few crumbs when we should be getting what's fair for our constituents. I will vote no on the underlying bill and I ask my colleagues to do so as well.",

    "title": "UNITED NATIONS TAX EQUALIZATION REFUND ACT OF 2011",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I am opposed to this bill for one simple reason: It's not a smart thing to do. It recklessly jeopardizes the security and safety of the people of New York City, and it does so for no reason.This is a national security issue. It will irresponsibly and indefinitely delay the vital security improvements to the perimeter of the U.N. campus in the city that the State Department wants to undertake and has the resources to commit. Why do this? Only a radical, wild-eyed obsession with taking a pound of flesh out of the U.N., which at times deserves it, and to do so no matter what the cost to our national security.Where is the common sense in clawing back money that is going to be used for desperately needed, long overdue security upgrades that we have the money for anyway and have the responsibility to do anyway? Where's the benefit to the taxpayer for maintaining the vulnerability of the most prominent international target which happens to be in al Qaeda's most highly targeted city?I can see how the terrorists benefit from reduced security. But I'm having a terribly hard time seeing how New Yorkers or Americans or the 1 million tourists to the building or even the multitudes of international representatives at the United Nations, whom we have undertaken to keep safe, will benefit. The U.N.'s Capital Master Plan calls for $100 million in security upgrades.As the host nation, that's something about which we should be proud. We are the guarantors of the U.N.'s physical security. We have the money in the Tax Equalization Fund that we can use for the security upgrades. The State Department has already committed to do it. The U.N. wants us to do it. New York City needs us to do it. The New York City Police Department is literally on its knees begging us to do it. We have the money. We don't need further appropriations. All we need to do is to stop this bizarre and radical effort to derail the whole effort.And you want to eliminate $100 million in jobs? Why?Security in New York is something I take very seriously. I think most Members do. But as this bill shows, some clearly don't. They are all too happy to rush to the floor every September 11 and boast about the amazing heroism of our police, our firefighters, our first responders. One day a year, they think New York City is part of America.The rhetoric is all patriotism and bombast, full of promises to do ``whatever it takes.'' And then comes the time to start paying for it. And then, Madam Speaker, some Members have a change of heart. Proudly remembering 9/11 heroism for some Members was no impediment to telling workers deathly ill from their time on ``the pile'' to go ahead and die. Congress didn't have any money for them--at least not until the story got out.Those of us from New York haven't forgotten all the so-called ``patriots'' who fought tooth and nail to stop the passage of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. So now, instead of fighting to get Congress to do the minimally decent thing, we find ourselves on the floor of the House fighting to prevent Congress from doing the maximally stupid thing. I'm not sure this constitutes progress. Taking money from vital security upgrades is radical, irresponsible, and reckless. It's stupid.Vote ``no'' on stupid.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th birthday of Beatrice Isabel Cohen, the pride of New York State.Born on February 24, 1911, in Bronx, New York, Bee grew up with a deep love and appreciation for her family, community and country. Forced to obtain employment as a teenager due to the loss of her father, she secured a job with a women's coat manufacturer at the age of 16 to help support her family, while also excelling as a champion amateur handball player. Five years later, she married her boss, Max Cohen, and continued to work by his side for more than 50 years. Bee and Max raised two sons, Joseph and Ronald.Friends and family of Bee would tell you that she always looks at the good in people. Her uplifting attitude is contagious, and has spread to her family, friends and neighbors--many of whom, and their parents, were not even born when Bee moved into her current apartment on the West Side of Manhattan shortly after World War II.In Bee's 100 years, she has lived through some of the most precariously challenging, exultant and remarkable eras. Yet, she has always kept up with the culture of the times. As a child, she listened to a crystal radio; today she views international programming on a plasma television with stereo sound. She has been a pillar of reliability to her entire family by showing love, warmth and guidance to her two sons, two grandsons and their wives, five great-grandchildren, and her many nieces and nephews.For her devotion to her family and her country, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to please rise and join me in honoring Beatrice Isabel Cohen on the occasion of her 100th birthday.",

    "title": "RECOGNIZING THE 450TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LATVIAN JEWISH COMMUNITY",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration and recognition of the 450th Anniversary of the Latvian Jewish community. Since the late 1500s, the Jewish people of Latvia have demonstrated incredible perseverance and courage through inconceivable trials and persecutions. As we reflect on this milestone anniversary, let us remember their history and celebrate their future.The first Jewish settlements in Latvia appeared in the late 16th century. Through steady immigration, expansion, and steadfast resilience, the community grew and spread across the country. As the Jewish population expanded, they contributed immeasurably to the economic, industrial, and cultural development of Latvia. These accomplishments came despite frequently being forced to cope with anti-Semitic laws and cultural prejudice. By the late 1930s, approximately 93,000 Latvian Jews were living and prospering in the country.In the summer of 1941, Nazi troops occupied Latvia. Within days of the occupation, the Nazis issued special decrees restricting Jewish rights and establishing ghettos. Jews from surrounding countries were forcibly transported to Latvian camps. Tens of thousands were murdered.By the conclusion of World War II, tragically, only 14,000 Latvian Jews remained. In the years after, Jews from surrounding regions relocated in Latvia--rebuilding their community to more than 36,000 people. In the aftermath of the greatest evil ever perpetrated against a people, the Latvian Jews marched on--restoring their culture and society, fighting against the oppression of Soviet rule. Latvia became one of the centers of Zionist dissidence and Jewish national movements in the Soviet Union. Jewish activists struggled for the right to immigrate to Israel and to openly honor the memory of Holocaust victims. Thousands emigrated to Israel, the United States and Western Europe.Today, the Latvian Jewish community of 13,000 is experiencing a rebirth. On this, their 450th anniversary, the Jews of Latvia can look back on their history with a solemn pride. Having suffered through terrible hardship, the Latvian Jewry is rebuilding its religious and social life--revitalizing the community's enduring spirit.I would like to extend special recognition to the Latvian Council of Jewish Communities and the United States Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad for organizing the extremely successful memorial project at Riga, Latvia's oldest Jewish cemetery. Under the leadership and guidance of Chairman Warren Miller and Commissioner Lee Seeman, the memorial at the Old Jewish Cemetery reminds the world of the tragedy of the Jews killed during World War II and asks us to strive for a better future. I am proud to celebrate the Latvian Jewish community's historic anniversary. I ask all my colleagues to join me in recognizing their past perseverance and achievements, and in extending our sincere best wishes for their future success and prosperity.",

One of which is, ``don't negotiate with thugs.'' It's been long obvious that we have no partner with whom to negotiate; only a party that started as our comrades in government, then our colleagues, who evolved into our opponents, declared themselves our enemies and now demand that we be their enablers. I refuse to play.Thugs are in the game to destroy, not build. They would destroy the government, and especially this presidency. They take hostages, and there is much work at stake that would be their next targets. It will be endless. The president has given into all of their demands, and they remain insatiable. It's time we starved the beast. Then . . .They came to Washington they say committed not to do business as usual. Then they demanded that we protect every loophole, every billionaire and every greedy element in our society except those who need some help.They set-up something that is their fail safe. I call it the ``Kevorkian Commission'' that will deliver the poison if in November, we don't volunteer to do it ourselves.We Democrats in the House were not at the table, and we wind up on the menu.There are arguments that are valid and good for voting ``aye.'' But I didn't come to this place to forget the homeless, the hapless and the hungry.The most vulnerable in our society don't watch their 401K plan, the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the futures market. Their future is getting through till tomorrow. They are more concerned about having a roof than they are the national debt ceiling. They need jobs, nutrition, education and encouragement. The time we've spent on this debate would indicate that we've bought into the trickledown theory.Here's what I know: the people I came here to help need real help. Their lives and future are really endangered. What happens to us people with portfolios, and Wall Street watchers is scary, but conjecture.Sounds hokey, but I'm voting for what I came here to do.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the exceptional achievements and outstanding career of New York State Assemblywoman Nettie Mayersohn. Nettie was the political midwife to a generation of young politicians in New York. She spent decades working tirelessly for the people of Queens, and I know I speak for many when I say that her recent retirement from the Assembly has truly marked the end of an era. Nettie is being honored this week for her innumerable accomplishments over many years by the Stevenson Regular Democratic Club at its annual dinner, and I would like to join in recognizing the profound impact that my very dear and long-time friend, Nettie Mayersohn, has had on our community.Nettie Mayersohn's steadfast dedication to Queens County began long before she was elected to the Assembly. For over 20 years, she served as a community activist, making a name for herself as an unrelenting advocate for children and families in Queens. She was a member of Community Board 8 for ten years, at one time serving as the Chairperson of its Youth Committee; she served as the Chairperson of the Pomonok Community Center; and she continues to serve as a Democratic District Leader, a role she has filled for some three decades. Nettie also served as the Executive Secretary of the New York State Crime Victims Board. In 1977, Nettie was New York State's delegate to the International Women's Conference and the recipient of the Builders of Brotherhood Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews. She received a B.A. from Queens College in 1978, and was elected four years later to represent the 27th District in the New York State Assembly.As an Assemblywoman, Nettie led the charge to improve healthcare for New Yorkers and defend the rights of victims of violent crime. Nettie's proudest and best-known achievement was the 1996 passage of her Baby AIDS bill, which requires doctors in New York State to tell a mother if her newborn child is HIV-positive. While the fight to enact this bill was, at times, a lonely battle, Nettie's tenacity and fortitude resulted in a landmark law that has saved an untold number of lives and led to an increase in the number of pregnant women who receive prenatal care. Among Nettie's numerous other legislative accomplishments are her HIV Rape Law, which requires a court to comply with a rape victim's request to test the accused for HIV; her Partner Notification Law, which requires the names of those testing positive for HIV to be reported to the Department of Health for the purpose of contact tracing and partner notification; her Victim Impact Law, which allows the victims of a crime to describe, in court, the effect the crime has had on their lives; and her Food Service Law, which implemented crucial health safety measures for food service workers.Nettie Mayersohn's unwavering commitment to AIDS policy inspired the Beyond AIDS Foundation to create the Nettie Award--an annual honor that recognizes outstanding efforts to promote HIV prevention and control in the United States and across the world. Nettie herself was given a special Nettie Award from Beyond AIDS in 2002, in recognition of her leadership on HIV/AIDS issues. That year, she also received the Public Service Award from the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.After 28 years of tireless service, Nettie retired from the Assembly at the beginning of April 2011 so she can spend time more with her wonderful family. While I lament Nettie's retirement from an impressive career as a public servant, she will remain my lifelong friend. We are all beyond grateful for everything she has done to help New Yorkers. I wish her all the best in her retirement--she will be sorely missed in public life.Mr. Speaker, Nettie Mayersohn is a one-of-a-kind leader and I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing her accomplishments and thanking Nettie for a lifetime of dedication to her community.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, this evening as some of my colleagues are doing, I would like to take a few minutes to share my thoughts about the American family.I believe there is nothing more important than strengthening families in America today. As Representatives in Congress, we should ever be mindful of the role we play in supporting America's families. It is because of this belief that I intend to do everything in my power, the power given to me by the people of the Fourth District of Alabama, to take a stand on the issues that are affecting our Nation's families.Two of the greatest gifts I believe that we can give our children are a balanced budget and lower taxes. We need to cut spending and reduce the tax burden to make sure that we have strong economic growth so that our children and our children's children can enjoy the same benefits that we have been given.It is time for the Federal Government to take responsibility for its decisions and their effect on the American people. Federal spending should be reined in and controlled. Reducing the growth of Federal spending is the way to get a balanced budget, not by taking more money from hardworking people who are already struggling to make ends meet.By balancing the budget, a middle-class family easily saves $1,500 per year. Who do you know would turn down having an extra $1,500 per year in their pocket?Another pressing concern for families is taxes. The American family is the most heavily taxed entity in the Nation. As has been pointed out several times here tonight, the average family in 1954 were paying just about 2 percent of its adjusted gross income in Federal income taxes. Today that figure has soared to 25 percent. And when you add State and local taxes, the average family of four pays almost 40 percent of its income in taxes. Forty percent. That is more than most families spend on housing, clothing, and food combined.The strain of meeting America's crushing tax burden has forced many homemakers into the work force, reducing the amount of time that parents spend with their children by approximately one-half. Part of the Republican agenda is to allow families the opportunity to spend more time together. By giving men and women the option to choose comptime instead of overtime, they are given the chance to spend more time with their families.Last, tonight as we focus on the issue of abortion on the House floor tomorrow, an issue that greatly affects the very existence of families, I would like to state my unwavering commitment to restoring respect for human life, born and unborn, in the 105th Congress. As we consider the partial birth abortion ban, I ask my colleagues to consider the words of Mother Theresa, who once stated that abortion is the greatest destroyer of peace today. It is a war against the child, a direct killing of the innocent child. Let us put an end to this brutal procedure that has taken the lives of so many babies each year and every day.In closing, recently I brought a resolution to the floor that would reaffirm the role of the Ten Commandments as a cornerstone of a fair and just society. I believe that this symbolic gesture is important in reaffirming the Judeo-Christian values on which this Nation was founded.As Representatives in Congress, we should always be mindful of the role that we play in setting the course of the American family. This is an awesome responsibility. But with God's help to see the right, we can make this great Nation a city on the hill.",

I ask unanimous consent that the Record reflect my support for House Resolution 93, and that I be permitted to submit a statement for the Record. I am proud to speak today in favor of House Resolution 93. This resolution states that Congress should not change the consumer price index. If any changes are found to be necessary, they should be made by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal agency with the necessary technical expertise and resources.Many Federal programs including Social Security, Medicare, and Veterans' benefits are tied to the consumer price index in order to determine cost-of-living adjustments based on inflation. Congress simply lacks the technical knowledge required to properly deal with any change in the consumer price index. Only the Bureau of Labor Statistics can adequately evaluate and address the situation. This resolution today makes this crystal clear.The consumer price index should not be politicized, nor should the budget be balanced through budgetary gimmicks. It is imperative that our Nation's seniors be protected. Promises have been made to our seniors that cannot be broken. I am committed to making sure that our Government keeps the promises it has made to the generation that saw us through some of the darkest moments of the 20th century.",

By the year 2010, there will be a 31-percent increase in the number of juveniles in our country. Unfortunately, the problem of juvenile crime is predicted to increase drastically as well unless we act now.Kids today commit crimes because they know they can get away with it. A juvenile that commits a cold blooded murder can be back on the street in most cases in less than 1 year.We must realize that juveniles can be just as dangerous as adults and begin to treat them accordingly. The system must be reformed.Kids in America today need the support of teachers and families and churches so that they can know the difference between right and wrong, and they need to know that a crime of any sort will not be tolerated regardless of age.

For economic development and safety reasons, this is an unacceptable omission from our national highway system.The completion of Corridor X could connect these two major metropolitan areas by running through Birmingham and through the Fourth Congressional District. It must be remembered that 30 years ago Congress passed legislation to create a system of highways in the 13-State Appalachian region, including a route to connect Memphis and then through Birmingham.Unfortunately, today the people in my area still are waiting for this four-lane highway to be completed. Economic growth is hampered because it is so difficult to transport goods and services between Birmingham and Memphis and through the northwestern part of Alabama.

Those two stories were major headlines, but not many people knew that it was the last time the Government will have spent less than 20 percent of the Nation's economic resources. With the new balanced budget, Mr. Speaker, it is going to happen again.Mr. Speaker, the balanced budget will have $350 billion in gross tax cuts over 10 years for families, for education costs, and for economic growth. Last, Mr. Speaker, the balanced budget agreement will finally do what its name says. It will balance the budget. It will be balanced by 2002, and then keeps it in surplus.In summary, the agreement means smaller government, lower spending, lower taxes, and a balanced budget, all in one agreement. It cannot be emphasized enough that this happens in one agreement.",

The more Government taxes, the more it discourages business from increasing output and creating jobs. The more Government taxes, the more it discourages people from saving and investing. The more Government taxes, the harder it is for families to make ends meet, the harder it is for people to get ahead, the harder it is for individuals to realize their dreams.Mr. Speaker, these commonsense truisms apply, whether or not the Federal budget is in deficit or surplus. They apply, no matter what part of the business cycle the economy is in. They apply to those in industries and all sectors of the economy.Quite simply, taxes are a drag on the economy, and an obstacle to people who are pursuing their dreams. Let us make it easier for people to make ends meet, get ahead, and save for the future, create new jobs, and pursue their dreams.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Miss Amanda Buckner of Gadsden, AL. Miss Buckner won statewide first place honors in the Veterans of Foreign Wars' Voice of Democracy Contest and third place honors in the national contest. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record her prize winning script. I am very proud of Miss Buckner's accomplishments, and of the way she represented Alabama in our Nation's capital.Welcome fans, to the 49th Olympics. You are about to see the relay event. On America's team we have five exceptional runners. The first is George Washington. Next we have Abraham Lincoln. On the third leg is Franklin D. Roosevelt. Ronald Reagan takes the fourth leg. The last leg is a bit different. America has a surprise runner. I will announce his name later. Ladies and Gentlemen, this team should carry democracy above and beyond. The runners take their marks. One . . . Two . . . Three . . . Go! Washington holds his baton of democracy tight and begins the run. Not only is he running, he is shaping this race for freedom. Washington is setting the pace for democracy with grace, authority, and peace. Earlier in an interview, Washington said he hopes this team prospers, focuses on their goals and sticks together. He wants to show everyone what a wonderful experience freedom can be. And boy has he! Although the older, stronger countries are trying to push him out of the way, he fights on. Washington has carried democracy above and beyond, but now he must pass it along. Honest Abe takes control. At this point democracy has fallen behind in the race. Slavery and economic unrest seem to be slowing them down. Yes, it looks as if they are at war with themselves. . . Wait, Lincoln refuses to let the injury of ignorance and racial discord tear this team apart. He is holding his own. He is showing the rest of the world that freedom will rise, and democracy will continue above and beyond. Lincoln is brave to continue after such an injury. It looks as if he still has the lead. Ladies and gentlemen, freedom may survive this tragedy after all. Franklin Delano Roosevelt has the baton now. The crowd has fallen into despair and lost all belief in team USA. But Roosevelt still holds on. Social Security, the Works Project Administration, and many other revolutionary new programs bring this crowd out of the depression. Many are saying Roosevelt is the best runner yet. We got a chance to speak with Roosevelt before he started the race, and he told this reporter that America would not succumb to this trial. Showing his astute leadership he told me, ``There is nothing to fear but fear itself.'' And his dedication will not allow any of his fears to get in the way of his winning this race. FDR fights through all the turmoil and comes ahead. The crowd is on its feet now. Roosevelt passes the baton to Ronald Reagan. This is a man who stole America's heart with his lopsided grin and his optimism. The crowd has hope for the future now that Reagan has the stick. The American dream is alive and well. Reagan took democracy above and beyond anything we had envisioned. He revitalized the economy and ended the cold war. After Reagan finished his end of the race, he told me the same thing he said in his inaugural address, ``We are too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams.'' Now, the last runner of the race for freedom. Are you wondering who it is?! Well, I'll tell you. The runner of the last leg is . . . you! That's right, it's all of you. America is ahead and thriving, but it all depends on how you run this race. Can you fight past the homeless, past the hatred, past the children who cry for a warm meal? It is up to you to make the difference. If you don't . . . who will? Run. Run for those who ran before you. Run for those who ache for the chance. If you run this race well, we should enter the 21st century the powerful and thriving country we have always been. All of America's teams have done fine jobs. They have kept this country on the road to greatness. All democracy needs now is a strong runner to bring home the gold. Let's watch and see how you finish this race. Will you win the race for freedom? Will you carry democracy above and beyond? As you stand and hear the anthem they are playing for you, you realize that there are those who will die and never know freedom. Run for them. Run for the country that swells you with pride. Run for peace. And run for freedom. Hold your head high as the flag is raised in your honor. Feel it to the marrow of your soul . . . Run.",

    "title": "IN SUPPORT OF REPEAL OF SECTION 1555 OF FASA",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, in 1994, the 103d Congress voted to turn the General Services Administration into a competitor with private employers for billions of procurement dollars generated by State and local governments. That something of this magnitude can be enacted into Federal law without so much as a hearing is a prime example of how disconnected Washington can become from the American people.Let me briefly discuss what I understand to be the conceptual case for this program. In a nutshell, proponents seem to contend that non-Federal public entities will get more bang for their procurement buck by purchasing items off the Federal supply schedules, making State and local taxpayers the ultimate beneficiaries of the cooperative purchasing program.Now I certainly support saving taxpyers' money, but where is the evidence in this instance? On the contrary, I am not convinced the cooperative purchasing program will provide anticipated savings to State and local governments and their taxpayers on a sustained basis.Despite the moratorium, the cooperative purchasing program has already had a disruptive effect in the marketplace, and the potential for further disruption is far, far greater. In what I am sure is reflective of the experiences of my colleagues, I have heard from small business persons in my district who fear for their futures if the cooperative purchasing program goes into effect.The more I hear, the more I am convinced section 1555 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act should be repealed. The sooner we get rid of this program, the better. If we fail to do so, it is highly unlikely that appropriate remedial action will be taken prior to implementation of the program, and countless small business persons and their employees--our constituents will see their worst fears about the future materialize.This issue quite simply pits big government against small business, and it's pretty clear that small business won't make out very well in that competition. That's what my constituents are telling me. These small companies which compete each and every day with very little if any margins for error, are fearful not of competition, but rather of unfair competition. All they ask for, I would say to the members of this committee, is a level playing field. They have a right to that, and by repealing the cooperative purchasing program we can meet their rightful expectation.",

For those interested in increasing the control of the Federal Government over the education of children, A-plus accounts will be something you will want to attack.A-plus accounts put more power in the hands of parents to ensure what is best for their kids. And what is best for their kids always includes a school where kids can feel safe, where teachers are dedicated to giving students the best education possible, and, most of all, where children are surrounded by an environment that inspires hope and confidence that a bright future belongs to them. This is not the case for millions of children across America today.A-plus accounts are education savings accounts that will give hope and a better education for many of those children who are trapped in schools that rob them of a bright future. If letting more children share in the American dream is more than a slogan, then A-plus accounts should be supported by Republicans and by Democrats alike.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the conference report on H.R. 2169, the Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriation Act for Fiscal Year 1998. Chairman Frank Wolf and Senate Chairman Richard Shelby have worked hard to ensure the transportation infrastructure needs of the country are adequately funded. Funding for surface transportation in this bill has been increased by 20 percent and includes $300 million for the Appalachian Development Highway System [ADHS].Funding for the ADHS will help expedite completion of corridor X and corridor V which run through the Fourth Congressional District, that I am privileged to represent.Corridor X is the proposed four-lane superhighway that will connect the cities of Memphis, TN and Birmingham, AL. It is an unthinkable omission from our National Highway System that there is no four-lane route between these two important cities in the Southeast.Corridor V is the proposed highway that begins east of Tupelo, MS, and runs through northern Alabama to Chattanooga, TN. Once completed, this highway will increase economic activity in northern Alabama and provide an important link with corridor X.Traditionally, the entire ADHS has been without a stable and significant funding source and this has resulted in the completion of only 78 percent of the corridors. By contrast, the Interstate Highway System is 99 percent completed. The $300 million provided in H.R. 2169 is a giant step in the right direction for ADHS, corridor X and corridor V.In addition, President Clinton and the Congress have both submitted legislation to reauthorize the Intermodel Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA] that include a specific funding category for the ADHS. While there are numerous disputes over funding formulas and overall funding levels in that debate, I am hopeful that whatever version to reauthorize ISTEA becomes law includes a specific category for ADHS. With a steady, stable source of funding, we can ensure that the transportation infrastructure of the Appalachian region is ready to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.Once again, I commend Chairman Wolf and Chairman Shelby for their hard work and look forward to working with them next year to build on this year's success.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my serious concerns about H.R. 2644. I have heard from many folks in my district who work in the textile industry who oppose this bill in its present form. I have also been contacted by some, such as Fruit of the Loom, who support the Senate version and are hopeful that passage of H.R. 2644 will be a step toward enacting a fairer version of free trade for the Caribbean region.Which brings me to my concern about H.R. 2644 being brought up under the Suspension Calendar. I believe that this bill in its present form raises too many concerns, and that these concerns would be better addressed if H.R. 2644 was to be brought to the floor with a rule allowing the necessary changes to be made.H.R. 2644 in its present form will unilaterally provide Caribbean and Central American countries parity with Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA]. I fear that this legislation would inflict further damage on our Nation's textile and apparel industries, which have lost 250,000 jobs since 1994.Furthermore, it is my understanding that the premise of this legislation, that Caribbean-Central American countries have been harmed by NAFTA, is erroneous. While U.S. employment, particularly in the apparel industry, is plummeting, apparel imports from Caribbean-Central America are surging. The U.S. textile industry should not be subject to the same upheaval the apparel industry had to go through under NAFTA.Simply put, it is bad economic and trade policy to grant countries unilateral, free access to the U.S. market without obtaining reciprocal access to foreign markets. I support free trade--but in the end--it must be fair trade.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, first let me say that I would like to commend my colleague, the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Rahall), for his leadership on the issue of Medicare coverage for venipuncture.Since Christmas, I have received hundreds of letters and numerous phone calls at both my home and office on home care and the health of our elderly. Most of these people calling and writing are scared. They are afraid for themselves and for their loved ones. Why are they afraid? Because the recently passed Balanced Budget Act will change their lives in a way that could be devastating.This change in coverage under Medicare for a service known as venipuncture or, more simply, the drawing of blood, was made without even a score from the Congressional Budget Office. No hearings were held; no specific clinical examples were used. We are being told that this will not have a strong impact on the lives of those who receive this service because they can qualify in some other way for venipuncture services.But what if they cannot? What if even a handful cannot get the services they need anymore? People could die. People could actually die if we are not sure about the impact of this change which became effective last week. In the court system in this country the jury must have evidence that can leave no reasonable doubt of guilt to make a decision. How can we sentence our seniors to this harsh change if we do not have assurance that they will be protected from harm?For this reason I have introduced H.R. 3137, the Medicare Venipuncture Seniors Protection Act, which will delay the implementation of this legislation for 18 months, giving us more time to study the impact of this change in coverage on our elderly and frail. This bill will also request specific information from Health and Human Services on the hardships of those in rural areas and what they will endure due to the effect of this new law.I fear that those who recommended this change were thinking more of places like New York City than rural parts of Alabama, West Virginia and Texas, where people may not be physically able to get to a doctor's office or to have their blood drawn. This small 29-word provision that was inserted into the Balanced Budget Act rather hastily did not take into account the situation of States like Tennessee, for instance, where under their State law lab technicians by law cannot leave the health care facility, leaving any home-bound person truly in need of venipuncture with very limited options.We are all in favor of cutting out waste, fraud and abuse, but let us not throw the baby out with the bathwater by punishing the elderly and the frail who have come to depend on these services. Waste, fraud and abuse in a Medicare system that has just been saved from the brink of bankruptcy cannot be tolerated, but a truly home-bound elderly Medicare recipient should not be punished for the fraud their health care provider is engaged in.I ask my colleagues to join with me in fighting to protect our seniors.",

I commend Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member Oberstar for their work in crafting legislation that meets the transportation needs of this nation.For the last six years Alabama has received an average of $330 billion per year for transportation. When this bill becomes law Alabama will receive $552 billion per year. This will mean a 67% increase and brings a level of fairness for Alabama since we have been getting the short end of the stick on transportation funding. Fairness in this process is crucial to ensure our roads and bridges are as we move into the 21st Century.However, I am most pleased with the creation of a specific category for the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) for the first time. The Fourth Congressional District of Alabama contains very few miles of four lane highways. Unfortunately, the Interstate Highway System did not include a route to connect Birmingham, Alabama with Memphis, Tennessee. This is an unacceptable omission from the Interstate Highway SystemThankfully, the Appalachian Development Highway System includes Corridor X which will connect these two cities, and runs through North Alabama, In addition, the system includes Corridor V which connects with Corridor X in Alabama and runs through North Alabama to Chattanooga, Tennessee is part of the Appalachian Development Highway System.Category funding for the Appalachian Development Highway System is crucial to expedite completion of these two highways. Traditionally, the Appalachian Development Highway System has had to rely on the annual appropriations process. Corridor X and Corridor V fared well in some years, but other years they received little, if any funds.This made it difficult for long term planning and has needlessly delayed completion of both highways. In fact the Appalachian Development Highway System is only 78% complete while the Interstate Highway System is 99% complete.Category funding ensures a stable source of funding that will complete the corridors in Alabama and throughout the thirteen states of Appalachia. I urge all Members to move this bill to Conference so we can complete this process before we lose additional time during the annual construction season.",

Although the allocation is tight, they managed to craft a bill that reverses the irresponsible cuts in the budget for the Army Corps of Engineers and other infrastructure projects that are so important to this nation. However, I am concerned about the lack of funding for the non-power programs administered by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).Since its creation in 1933, TVA has had two responsibilities in the Tennessee Valley: produce electric power; and to provide flood control, navigation, and manage aquatic vegetation growth along the Tennessee River and its tributaries. Many people in Washington today confuse the non-power programs with the larger issue of electric utility restructuring.I realize that last year the House decided to eliminate funding for non-power programs because the Chairman of TVA, Craven Crowell, announced in early 1997 that TVA would forgo non-power programs to concentrate on the production of electric power. The residents in the Tennessee Valley and the state and local governments expressed a strong desire for TVA to continue its traditional non-power programs.Under the agreement reached last year between the House and the Senate, TVA is scheduled to receive no funding for these important programs in Fiscal Year 1999. However, the Senate has included $70 million for the programs, and I am hopeful that when the Energy and Water bill goes to Conference, the House will reconsider funding the non-power programs for Fiscal Year 1999. Until there is an alternative with a clear transition, it is imperative that TVA continue these programs through the appropriations process. The ratepayers of my Congressional District, and throughout the Tennessee Valley, deserve no less.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today we continue to mourn the loss of two of the finest men this Capitol has known. John 15:13 states that, ``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.'' Had John Gibson and J.J. Chestnut not put themselves in harm's way, the lives of many would have been lost in last week's tragic event. These two men of courage laid down their lives so that their friends, coworkers and tourists visiting from around the world would be safe. We are truly blessed to have men and women of such noble character and bravery serving on the Capitol Police force.As thousands of visitors came together yesterday to walk through the Capitol Rotunda to pay their respects to these men of courage, I realized that we are only able to safely visit this building which is a symbol of freedom because of the service of the many members of law enforcement we have here in Washington. We must never take for granted those who serve to protect and preserve the freedoms that we enjoy here in the United States Capitol, and across this nation.My prayers go out to the families of these two heroes who died that we might live. The memory of their actions will not be soon forgotten.",

    "title": "SUPPORT THE U.S. STEEL JOBS PROTECTION ACT",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I am introducing today the U.S. Steel Jobs Protection Act, a bill with already 10 bipartisan cosponsors. This bill imposes an immediate 1-year ban on hot-rolled steel from Japan, Brazil, and Russia.Our trade partners, knowing the slowness of the petition process, have dumped millions of tons of below-cost steel on the U.S. market. Thousands of permanent U.S. jobs will be lost by the time the petition process concludes.The U.S. steel industry mass modernized and cut production man-hours per ton from 10 to three. This strong, by temporary, action must be taken if we are to be serious about helping families who work for the steel industry.We urge support for the bill and strongly urge the President to take immediate action to help America's steelworkers.Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing ``The U.S. Steel Jobs Protection Act,'' a bill with ten bipartisan cosponsors. Currently, U.S. steel producers are in a crisis due to outrageously unfair conditions. Membership in the World Trade Organization, and signing onto the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) implies a willingness to abide by fair trading practices in order to avoid what some call trade wars.Unfortunately, a number of countries experiencing severe financial crisis have knowingly allowed their steel companies to export steel to the United States at a cost far below their own domestic market price or even below the cost of production. While I understand the need for income by these countries, I do not condone what at best is a reckless disregard for the effect that such exports have on workers in our steel industry.Since the 1980's, our steel industry has modernized and streamlined. In 1982, it cost roughly 10 man hours per ton to produce U.S. steel. In 1998, the average is below 4 MHPT. The U.S. steel industry has invested over $50 billion in steel plant modernization over the past two decades. The industry employed 425,000 in 1980, and 160,000 in 1998. The U.S. steel industry forecasts that imports of hot-rolled steel in 1998 will be over 500 percent of that imported in 1995. According to industry analysts, some foreign steel is being sold at one-third the cost of production, or more. Clearly, the U.S. steel industry has done its part.No business can long withstand that kind of assault. I wish that a gentle call to our foreign trading partners for reasonable action would suffice. I am afraid that we are way beyond that point, however. U.S. companies and unions filing a petition for relief from unfair trade practices know that they must wait until severe financial damage is evident for their petition to be acted upon with any urgency. Even then, the best they can hope for is a partial resolution in 160 days. Such cases usually take 12 to 18 months. The current crisis in the steel industry is too great for that kind of wait.My bill imposes an immediate, temporary moratorium on the further import of certain steel products from three countries--Japan, Russia, and Brazil--for 1 year. Upon completion of the case filed September 30, 1998, duties may be assessed on all steel dumped at a below-cost price retroactive to one year prior the filing of the petition. Should this bill become law, that 1-year retroactive aspect would also apply to any other petitions naming other countries engaged in similar steel-dumping practices.I realize that there are some concerns about our obligations under the GATT agreements and as a member of the WTO. I agree that we should keep our word and treat all of our trading partners fairly. I also believe that our first obligation as Members of the federal government is to protect the citizens of the United States. What we are currently experiencing is not a minor misunderstanding, or a cultural difference in economic practices. We are the victim of a deliberate action which is harming our domestic steel industry.Not defending ourselves in this situation is akin to unilateral disarmament while being fired upon. My suggestion of a temporary import ban is not a strike back; it is a recovery period from a battle in which we are wounded. If you believe that membership in the WTO and accepting GATT overrides all U.S. federal laws, historical precedents, constitutional authority, and the moral duty of the federal government to its citizens, I wish you would please come to Gadsden, Alabama and explain that to the 150 or so families who have lost their income, or will lose it within a few weeks.Please explain to the remaining 2000+ steel industry employees that they must sacrifice their jobs to outrageously unfair trade practices so that we can stabilize the governments and economies of other nations. I don't think they will understand. Nor, frankly, will I.If our neighbors, our foreign allies need help, let us discuss in a reasonable and straightforward manner on this House floor a plan specific to each country regarding how we might help them--and by that I do not mean throwing away billions of dollars to the IMF board, who have no idea where billions of dollars recently sent to Russia have ended up.I would like to see this bill become law. I would like to see the President take a serious look at his authority under various U.S. trade laws and take action himself to impose a temporary import ban so that the industry might have a period in which to recover. If our trading partners do not like these suggestions, the solution is easy. Let them admit to the wrongness of their actions, and present to the President a serious plan for halting or slowing imports and making reparations directly to the U.S. steel industry.The United States of America is strong, and generous. Let us help our friends abroad, but let us stop sacrificing U.S. jobs in what amounts to an unfunded, unauthorized, program of foreign aid.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Archer) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Crane) for their work to bring this resolution to the floor today.The United States steel industry is the most efficient and competitive in the world. Currently, however, the industry is in a crisis due to the dumping onto the U.S. markets of below-cost production of steel from countries in financial distress. Although I support this resolution, I strongly believe that we must have an immediate ban on certain foreign steel imports to give the U.S. steel industry a level playing field.My bill, 4762, which has 6 Republicans and 5 Democrats, does that. The current GATT agreement and the U.S. review process for trade complaints do nothing to help the families who have already lost their jobs. It is wrong to let American jobs die as part of a back-door foreign policy method for keeping foreign governments and economies afloat. By leaving our ports open to this flood of steel while Europe maintains trade barriers is exactly what we are doing.I urge the President to immediately stop this flood of foreign, unfairly priced steel. If our trade partners do not like it, let them file a case and go through the same lengthy bureaucratic process that we have to suffer. Seven steel company presidents, 12 Governors and the United Steelworkers of America have pleaded with the President to halt these imports.This resolution urges the President to engage Europe and Japan to end their trade barriers. I ask for everyone to support this resolution as a first step in an effort to give America's steelworkers a fair chance to compete.",

I am pleased that today Members have an opportunity to vote on a tough, reasonable House Resolution addressing this issue.The leadership has been negotiating almost around the clock with the Clinton administration on the budget, so I appreciate their attention to this also very important matter of aiding the U.S. steel industry.With all the budget talks going on, why have we members of the Congressional Steel Caucus pressed so hard for a vote on steel in these last days of the session? It is because the U.S. steel industry is in a crisis. It is too late to make leisurely proposals as if we were addressing a problem of the future. The problem is NOW; orders to U.S. steel companies are at 50% of normal NOW; families are out of work NOW.Some oppose a one-year ban on certain foreign steel products and say that such an action is too strong. Consider these two facts: (1) U.S. companies wishing to file a trade petition about dumping must first spend six months gathering data so that their case will be taken seriously; (2) there is approximately six months of foreign steel currently piled up in ports from Alabama to Maryland to Ohio.Voting yes on this resolution is the very least we should do as Members of Congress to help a U.S. industry which is unfairly being sacrificed in the name of global stability. I have said before and say again--it is wrong to kill U.S. jobs for the purpose of keeping afloat foreign governments and economies.The U.S. steel industry has streamlined and modernized. No one can compete against unfair, below production-cost prices. This resolution is similar to my bill H.R. 4762, and I commend Mr. Traficant on his long-term leadership on this issue. Vote yes on this resolution to urge President Clinton to take immediate action. I yield back the balance of my time.",

But this is not the reason that the U.S. steel industry is suffering. Since 1980 it has modernized, it has streamlined, and it is 240 percent more efficient.The International Trade Commission announced that foreign companies have indeed dumped hot rolled steel at prices below their own market. That announcement and the suspension agreement with Russia might provide some relief, but a key fact is often missing from the discussion. Some of these same countries have simply switched their dumping to other categories of steel. Russia has played that game since The coming weeks and months are very critical to saving these United States jobs. This Congress must act. It must act quickly in order to save American jobs and our steel industry here in the United States of America.",

First, when finally faced with a trade petition like the one filed in September of 1998, foreign countries which dump steel on the U.S. market simply switch from one category to another. All the while they are laughing at the slowness and the expense of our trade enforcement process.Second, I appreciate the hard work of the Commerce Department but when we hear about an expedited trade process we must realize that this is merely shaving off 20 to 30 days off a 9- to 12-month process.Third, by allowing dumping we are deliberately sacrificing productive, nonobsolete but productive United States jobs.I would just ask my colleagues today, as they are looking over this piece of legislation, to look at it very closely before voting. Get a complete look at the issue of steel and the steel imports that have come into this country, and I think when my colleagues see an accurate picture of this they will be led to support this bill.

He started his journey while attending school at Oklahoma State University, earning a degree in forestry while working on the Ouachita National Forest, Poteau Ranger District in 1965 and will end this journey on June 3, 1999. He served three years in the U.S. Army, earned the rank of 1st Lieutenant and served one year in Vietnam.In April 1986, Mr. Ramey began working on the Bankhead National Forest as the District Ranger. During this time period he achieved a number of important accomplishments such as the success of using $700,000 provided by former Congressman Bevill to build a horse trail, multiple-use trail and hiking trail. He helped to manage stream side management zone practices that led to the protection of mussels and other aquatic species; he was instrumental in the design and layout of Clear Creek and Corinth Recreation Areas and also in trying to help operate additional recreational facilities during a time of increased use and decreased budgets. In April 1991, his leadership efforts led to the Bankhead Ranger District being recognized by the Southern Region of the National Forest Service as the best unit within the southeast.As someone who grew up around the forest, I know how much his efforts have been appreciated and how he will be missed by everyone who cares about the Bankhead National Forest. I extend to Mr. Ramey, his wife Zondra, and his family best wishes for a job well done and hope he will have many years ahead to enjoy a well deserved retirement.",

Today anyone can dial 911 in any type of emergency, such as sickness, fire, police, or ambulance and a policeman on duty will immediately summon the help needed. Although there are no specific figures available, it is clear the 911 service has saved countless lives across the country.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, in this century, the United States has led the world in transforming industry, communication, and technology. We have found cures for once-fatal diseases and introduced freedom and democracy to the world. We sit on the threshold of a new century, and new millennium with a great mandate: laying the groundwork for a daring, new world.On the brink of the nineteenth century, our Founding Fathers faced a similar mandate. One whose impact would reach beyond anything they could have imagined, and one which we live each day. They gathered together to establish a form of government that no other nation had ever attempted with freedoms that no other nation had ever even dreamed of: freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion.The work of these men was truly inspired. The wisdom in the words of the Constitution serves as the very cornerstone of hope and liberty. But these men did not rashly pull the Constitution together without forethought. The delegates of the Continental Congress debated over the course of months to author a document which changed the course of history for all people. It was during this debate, that they came to a standstill. On June 28, 1787, 212 years ago this week, the delegates hit a stalemate over many issues.Ben Franklin saw that the impasse could not be reconciled by any human means: ``The small progress we have made after four or five weeks' close attendance and continual reasonings with each other--our different sentiments on almost every question . . . producing as many noes as ayes--is, methinks, a melancholy proof of the imperfection of the human understanding . . . I therefore beg leave to move that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of heaven and its blessings on our deliberations . . .''Franklin recognized that the future of the Constitution, and the nation, depended upon Divine intervention. In the faces of the Congressional Delegates he saw pride, determination and no hope of compromise. Franklin knew that the only way the Constitution could be agreed upon was to call the delegates to humility and prayer. He recognized the need of each individual to search their hearts and seek the will of God.Franklin called on the Members of the Congress to take three days of prayer and fasting. At the end of these three days, the delegates humbly returned, and were able to complete the framework of the Constitution which is the basis of the law of our nation.As Americans, we are all grateful that Ben Franklin recognized the need for God and prayer within the political agenda. Each of the delegates had a strong understanding of right and wrong. They knew the laws of the land needing to reflect a moral standard, a moral law. It is time we call our nation back to this morality.Two weeks ago I offered an amendment called the Ten Commandments Defense Act, and you, my distinguished colleagues, helped to pass this legislation. It was a public declaration that God is not dead, despite the violence and confusion that haunts the current age.Now I, along with the gentlelady from Idaho and others speaking on behalf of this resolution, call our country to set aside a time of reflection, a time to search our hearts and seek God's guidance. We must approach our families, our jobs, and our communities with the same humility and desire for reconciliation as our Founding Fathers sought in establishing the law of this land.Today, we stand, not only on the brink of a new century, but at the dawning of a new millennium. We have the great honor, and the weighty responsibility, of setting the groundwork of the next thousand years. Let us do this with courage. Let us do this with honor. Most importantly, let us humbly set a precedent for the new millennium, and recognize God as the source of wisdom, goodness and strength.",

As horrifying as abortion is, this bill really deals with another issue, that of States rights. Two weeks ago, you joined me to pass the Ten Commandants Defense Act, another piece of legislation securing the rights of States to establish their own laws. Both of these pieces of legislation protect the Tenth Amendment of States rights.Representative Ros-Lehtinen's act argues that citizens and businesses of one state should respect the laws of another state. If the people of Alabama have voted for the rights of the parents to know if their children want an abortion, this is the law within the borders of Alabama. No one, not even a well-meaning friend, has the right to break this law by taking a child away from their home and into another state for what could be the most terrifying and traumatic experience of their life.Abortion clinics are enticing people to break the law by advertising in the phone books of neighboring states with parental notification laws. We are constantly hearing of the tobacco industry being sued for illegally targeting minors in advertising. Using the same logic, these abortion clinics may be setting themselves up for a few lawsuits. We convict and sentence adults for engaging in sexual relations with a minor, yet we don't even slap the hand of an adult who aids a minor in destroying their unborn child. Unfortunately, right now, without this law in place, a statutory rapist can conceal the evidence of his crime by taking his young victim across state lines to abort the child he fathered.As a parent and a defender of the Constitution, I am calling on you, my fellow lawmakers, to respect the autonomous powers of States to allow parents to parent.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr. a native of my hometown of Haleyville, Alabama. On July 23, 1999, Judge Johnson passed away at the age of 80.After graduating from the University of Alabama in 1943 at the top of his class, Frank Johnson enlisted in the Army as a private. Soon, he received a commission as an infantry lieutenant. During World War II, he served during the Normandy invasion, and won a Bronze Star as a platoon leader in Gen. Patton's Third Army. Twice he was wounded in battle during the war. After he recovered, he was transferred to England and served out the war as a legal officer in the Judge Advocate General's Corps, eventually being promoted to Captain.Judge Johnson was first promoted to the bench in 1954, then the youngest serving federal judge in the nation. In 1955, he was elevated to U.S. Middle District Judge in Montgomery, Alabama, and in 1979 he was named to the U.S. Court of Appeals.His career on the bench was marked by many pivotal rulings. In 1956, in his first major ruling, Judge Johnson joined the majority on a three-judge panel in the case concerning the Rosa Parks case. This decision brought the end of segregated bus systems. With this ruling, Judge Johnson staked his place in the civil rights battle, fighting for equality for all Americans during his judicial career.Judge Johnson participated in rulings that desegregated all types of public places and services, from schools to museums, from airports to restaurants from libraries to parks. Even in the face of harsh criticism and resistance, Judge Johnson stood firm in his belief in equality and justice for all Americans.Desegregation was not his only accomplishment in the Civil Rights fight. After finding rampant discrimination against blacks registering to vote, Judge Johnson issued a ruling that became the formula Congress used to ensure voting rights nationwide in the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Also, Judge Johnson was part of a panel that ordered the Alabama State Legislature to draw its district lines by population, not by mere geography. This was the first ruling of its time, and helped ensure that citizens were not disenfranchised simply because they lived in a minority-dominated geographic area.It was his style to stand firm on what he believed was right, often in the face of intense criticism. Judge Johnson, one of America's most distinguished jurists, is an example of dedication for all Americans. All of America--but especially Alabama--feels the loss of Judge Frank Johnson, and we are thankful for his life of public service.",

    "title": "``SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE''",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. I think he makes some very excellent points on his discussion about separation of church and state, and I would like to expound on that just a bit.In several measures recently debated within this chamber, the topic of protecting traditional religious expressions was made. In each case opponents were quick to claim that such protections would violate the First Amendment's separation of church and state.Interestingly, the First Amendment's religion clause states: ``Congress shall make no law respecting and establishment of reference list or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''Despite what many claim, the phrase ``separation of church and state'' appears nowhere in the Constitution. In fact, one judge recently commented: ``So much has been written in recent years to a wall of separation between church and state that one would almost think at times that it would be found somewhere in our Constitution.''And Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart also observed: ``The metaphor of the `wall of separation' is a phrase nowhere to be found in the Constitution.''And current Chief Justice William Rehnquist also noted: ``The greatest injury of the `wall' notion is its mischievous diversion from the actual intentions of the drafters of the Bill of Rights. The 'wall of separation between church and state' is a metaphor based on bad history. It should be frankly and explicitly abandoned.''The phrase ``separation of church and state'' was given in a private letter in 1802 from President Thomas Jefferson to the Baptists of Danbury, Connecticut, to reassure them that their free exercise of religion would never be infringed on by the Federal Government.Now that phrase means exactly the opposite of what Jefferson intended. In fact, the phrase ``separation of church and state'' has recently become a Federal hunting license against traditional religion in this country.For example, in Texas a judge struck down a song which was sung during a voluntary extracurricular institute activity because the Congress had promoted values such as honesty, truth, courage, and faith in the form of a prayer.In Virginia, a student told to write her autobiography in her English class was forced to change her own life story because in her autobiography she had talked about how important religion was in her life.In Minnesota, it was ruled that even when artwork is a historical classic, it may not be predominantly displayed in schools if it depicts something religious.In Pennsylvania, because a prosecuting attorney mentioned seven words from the Bible in the courtroom, a statement which lasted actually less than 5 seconds, a jury sentence was overturned for a man convicted of brutally clubbing a 71-year-old woman to death.In Ohio, courts ruled that it was unconstitutional for a board of education to use or refer to the word ``God'' in its official writings.In California, a judge told a public cemetery that it was unconstitutional to have a planter in the shape of a cross, for if someone were to view that cross, it could cause emotional distress and thus constitute an injury-in-fact.In Omaha, Nebraska, a student was prohibited from reading his Bible silently during free time or even to open his Bible at school.In Alaska, schools were prohibited from using the word ``Christmas'' at school, from exchanging Christmas cards or presents, or from displaying anything with the word ``Christmas'' on it because it contained the word ``Christ.''In Missouri, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Illinois, courts told cities that when they compose their city seals, seals with numerous symbols that represent the diverse aspects of the community, such as industry, commerce, history and schools, that not even one of those symbols can acknowledge the presence of religion within the community, even if the name of the city is religious, or if the city was founded for a religious purpose.In South Dakota, a judge ruled that a kindergarten class may not even ask the question of whose birthday is celebrated at Christmas.In Texas, a high ranking official from the national drug czar's office who regularly conducts public school anti-drug rallies was prohibited from doing so because even though he was an anti-drug expert, he was also a minister and thus was disqualified from delivering his secular anti-drug message.In Oregon, it was ruled that it is unconstitutional for a war memorial to be erected in the shape of a cross.In Michigan, courts said that if a student prays over his lunch, it is unconstitutional for him to pray aloud.Although States imprint thousands of special-order custom license plates, which I am sure everyone has seen driving down the highway, for individual citizens each year, the State of Oregon refused to print the word ``PRAY,'' the State of Virginia refused to print ``GOD 4 US,'' and the State of Utah refused to print ``THANK GOD,'' claiming that such customized license plates which were of course made at the request of the individual purchasing them, violated the ``separation of church and state.''There are scores of other examples. They are all based on a nonconstitutional phrase. And all of this occurs despite the first amendment's explicit guarantee for the free exercise of religion. This is ridiculous. It has gone too far, Mr. Speaker.It appears that every conceivable effort is being made to hide religion as if it were something sinister and pernicious, to banish it from the public view as if it were monstrous and diabolic, to punish those who publicly pursue it as if they were sinister threats to our society, to put them under house arrest and demand that they not practice their beliefs outside their home or places of worship.This body should not aid and should not abet the hostility against people of faith and against traditional expressions of faith, and no Member of this body should be party to confusing the clear, self-evident wording of the Constitution or misleading the American public by claiming the first amendment says something that it does not.The first amendment says only that ``Congress shall make no law respecting establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'' It says nothing about separation of church and state. We should get back to upholding what the Constitution actually says, not upholding what some people wish that it said. It is time for reliance on the separation rhetoric to diminish and for reliance on actual constitutional wording to increase.Now, of course, none of us in this Chamber desire that we pick one particular denomination to be chosen for the United States. However, this Nation was founded on Judeo-Christian principles and that is just a part of our history. And at the same time all of us in this Chamber, every Member of this body, and I think every Member of this country, welcomes with open arms people of all faiths into these United States.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 199, which expresses the sense of Congress that prayers and invocations at public school events are constitutional on the First Amendment and that the Supreme Court should uphold the constitutionality of such activities.Mr. Speaker, it is most ironic that while an increasing number of violent crimes have occurred in our Nation's schools in recent months and even recent years, some Federal courts have ruled to restrict the very expression of faith which can play such a significant role in providing desperately needed moral guidance to our youth. Under the proper guidance of coaches and administrators, team and individual sports can make a significant, positive impact on the character of students and student athletes in their most formative years.A strong religious message, coupled with good sportsmanship, instilled by adult role models, can make a positive, long-term influence on our Nation's young people.I join my colleagues who are opposed to these Federal court decisions that would ban organized prayer from sporting events. Student athletes have a clear constitutional right to exercise their religious beliefs, particularly during school and extracurricular activities. I do not believe that students in our country should have to check their religion and their beliefs at the school door.Our Founding Fathers believed that prayer and even studying the Bible were activities that should be encouraged among our youth rather than suppressed, even in our schools. Our Constitution grants freedom of, not freedom from, religion. Because of these rulings in the past, I am proud to join the gentleman from Texas in support of this resolution to affirm the importance of prayer at sporting events at a pivotal time in the life of our Nation's young people. There can be no compromise in the defense of our commitment to the very principles that have made this Nation, the United States of America, the greatest nation on the face of the Earth.",

Res. 350, which I have co-sponsored, which expresses the sense of the House that Congress should exercise its oversight responsibilities and conduct hearings into the possible trafficking of baby parts for profit.Throughout the abortion debate, many Americans have come to realize that abortion is a morally repugnant act which has no place in a civilized society. In spite of the brutality of partial-birth abortion and other abortion methods which more Americans have become aware of in recent years, Congress has been unable to override a Presidential veto which would outlaw this practice.Many Americans are beginning to reevaluate their views on this issue. Recently uncovered evidence shows that infants ``delivered'' by partial-birth abortion and even those born alive have been killed for their body parts. Private companies have circumvented laws banning this practice by acting as ``middlemen'' in this gruesome trade by selling baby body parts from abortion clinics to research facilities.My colleagues, certainly we can begin to take some action to address this terrible practice. I strongly urge you to join me in voting for H. Res. 350, to express the sense of the House that Congress should conduct hearings into the possible trafficking of baby parts for profit.

    "title": "INVESTIGATION OF MURDERS IN AL-KOSHEH, EGYPT",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today in a meeting of the House Appropriations Committee to consider the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2001, I added the following Report language to the paragraph about U.S. financial aid to Egypt: ``Nevertheless, the Committee is concerned about ongoing violence experienced by the Christian minority in Egypt. The Committee urges Egypt to expedite the investigations of the murders of 2000 and 1998 in Al-Kosheh, and of the 1998 interrogations.''Mr. Speaker, it is a fact that Egypt is a valuable ally and has greatly helped U.S. efforts to advance peace in the Middle East. It is also a fact that Christians in Egypt, especially Coptic Christians, face ongoing violence and are in need of full protection of the Egyptian Judicial system. The worst of these outbreaks is the murder of 21 persons in January, 2000 in the town of Al-Kosheh, just a few weeks after I visited Egypt with three other Members of Congress.My report language expresses the concern of the Committee about this violence and urges Egypt to expedite investigations regarding this incident but also of events in 1998 in the same small town. There were two murders in 1998 and allegations of brutal interrogations by the Police, 1014 Christians were arrested and interrogated.President Mubarak ordered an investigation of these arrests, and in August of 1999, 129 persons were interviewed within the course of two days. The interviewing process lapsed and then resumed in October of 1999. To date, only 400 of those 1014 persons have been interviewed. That figure includes the 129. A conclusion of the investigation likely would suggest the dismissal or prosecution of several members of the Egyptian police. There is precedent for such action.When tourists were killed in Luxor, the reaction of Cairo was swift and decisive, including the appointment of a new Minister of the Interior, who oversees the police. That sent a powerful message throughout the country, and Egypt is currently a very safe country to visit. The great majority of Muslim citizens of Egypt are law-abiding and desire peace. I am afraid that because of concerns about possibly energizing extremist Muslim groups to the point of violence, Cairo is reluctant to prosecute Muslims when there are incidents of violence against Christians.Christians face a range of legal challenges and are in need of protection from violence. Since there is no stated government policy of discrimination, it is reasonable for Christian citizens to expect full justice from their courts, just as Muslim citizens do.Mr. Speaker, I suggest that the taxpayers of the United States would be more than happy to see some of their aid to Egypt used to pay for additional personnel or equipment which would expedite these investigations and lead to the prosecution of any found persons found guilty of torture or other violations of civil rights. I am especially concerned that Shayboub William Arsal has been falsely accused and sentenced to 15 years hard labor even though the only two witnesses recanted their testimony and stated that their original accusations were coerced.In accordance with Egypt's strategic alliance with the United States, the Foreign Operations Subcommittee agreed to the President's request to expedite a portion of Egypt's military aid. The adoption of these two sentences by the Full Committee in the Report expresses the expectation of the Appropriations Committee that Egypt will make progress on these important human rights matters.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, on June 19, 1915, a star and a humanitarian was born. Maxwell Emmett, better known as ``Pat'' Buttram of Addison, Alabama, in Winston County brought laughter and untold hours of sheer enjoyment to citizens across this great Nation. His film career spans 46 years from the early days as Gene Autry's sidekick to his parts as a voice in four of Disney's animated movies. Millions of television viewers will remember Pat for his role as the affable Mr. Haney in the television series ``Green Acres'' and ``Petticoat Junction.'' Pat had a keen wit in the style of Will Rogers and was a much sought-after speaker.Pat was brought up in a Methodist parsonage, son of a circuit-riding Methodist minister. He was the seventh child in a family of five boys and three girls. Pat never forgot the early lessons taught by this strong, God-fearing family. Concern for others was a staple in the Buttram household. As Pat's fame grew, he used his celebrity status to perform in benefits and shared his time and talents to help those less fortunate. He never forgot his roots or the place he called home. He donated not only money, but also his time to help build Camp Maxwell near his home in Alabama. This camp has played an important part in the lives of youth and the handicapped. Pat died in Hollywood, California, on January 8, 1994, and was laid to rest in his family church at Maxwell Chapel in Winston County, Alabama.While maybe not as well known, Pat's older brother, Gus Buttram, who lives in my hometown of Haleyville, was equally committed to serving others. Gus was born on June 21, 1913. While in high school, Gus suffered a paralysis that was brought on by tuberculosis. After surgery and rehabilitation, he graduated from Altoona High School in Etowah County, Alabama. Following graduation from Athens State in 1942 with a bachelor's degree in science and history, Gus married Rebecca, better known as Becky Buttram, Eppes of Goodwater, Alabama, on January 18, 1943. He followed his father into the ministry as a fourth generation Methodist minister. His first church appointment was at Remlap Methodist Church in Blount County, Alabama. Over the next 3 decades he would have many assignments in north Alabama.Gus and Becky's desire to serve others is unquestioned. Turning down more lucrative career paths, Gus and Becky enriched the lives of those they serve. Retiring in 1978, Gus and Becky live at Pebble, near Haleyville, in Winston County, Alabama. They take great pride in their children, Mary Buttram Young, who is a dialysis nurse at Helen Keller Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama and Marvin McDaniel, better known as ``Mac'' Buttram, who is pastor of St. Andrews United Methodist Church in Cullman, Alabama, and is a fifth generation Methodist minister.Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege today to recognize these two brothers, Gus and Pat Buttram, for their unselfish service to others.",

Our Nation's seniors rely on Social Security for approximately 40 percent of their income. Many depend on it for more.Without a lockbox, approximately $2.9 trillion in projected Social Security and Medicare Part A surpluses over the next ten years could be spent on programs and initiatives which may do little, if any, to protect our Nation's seniors. H.R. 2 will ensure that these surpluses will be used only to strengthen Social Security and Medicare. Furthermore, protecting Social Security and Medicare makes it easier for the Treasury Department to reduce the public debt.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 2.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring voice to my constituents, my State, and people around the Nation who mourn the loss of Johnny Micheal Spann, better known as Mike Spann. Mike Spann lost his life as has already been said, in service to this country during a prison uprising in Afghanistan on November 25, 2001. He is an American hero and I stand to honor him today.There are few facts about the exact circumstances of his death that we currently know, due to the nature of the war. Mike Spann was serving as a paramilitary officer with the CIA and was at the prison in Mazar-e Sharif interviewing Taliban prisoners. It is believed that these prisoners smuggled guns and grenades into the prison and used these munitions to stage an uprising against the Northern Alliance and the American soldiers.Mike and a fellow CIA officer drew their weapons and attempted to fight their way out of the prison fortress. While his fellow CIA officer was able to escape, Mike, unfortunately, became the first American killed in action in Afghanistan.Before his death, he and his fellow CIA officer were able to alert outside forces who were sent in to squelch the uprising. The bloody battle continued for 3 days. Five other Americans were injured during the struggle. It was not until the prison could be secured that Mike's body was found.Even without the full details of the prison riot during which he was killed, we can be certain that Mike Spann died doing what he loved, serving and fighting for his country. Since September 11, we have witnessed an outpouring of patriotism across this Nation. Mike was someone who overflowed with patriotism even during a time when it was not popular. His father recently quoted Mike as saying, ``Someone has to do the right thing that no one else wants to do.''From a young age, he wanted to pursue a career in the Marines and with either the CIA or FBI. After graduating from Winfield High School in Marion County, Alabama, he attended Auburn University where he earned a degree in criminal justice. He immediately pursued his next goal, serving in the Marine Corps from 1992-1999, and he earned the rank of captain. From there, he was recruited to work for the CIA in special operations.Mike is survived by his wife Shannon and three children, Alison 9, Emily 4, and 6-month old Jake. Our prayers go out to them and the rest of the Spann family. Mike is also survived by his parents, Johnny and Gail Spann, and two sisters, Tonya Ingram and Tammy Dunavant. We are glad that they can join us in the Chamber today.Mr. Speaker, I was proud to attend the burial of Mike Spann yesterday in Arlington National Cemetery. The cemetery is appropriate for a fallen hero. Full military honors were given, highlighted by the caisson, a 21-gun salute and a Marine honor guard.It should be noted that a memorial service was also held last Thursday in Mike's hometown in the district I represent of Winfield, Alabama. Mike's daughter, Alison, wrote a letter to him just a short while back, and the words of this letter should echo in our ears and our hearts as we consider this resolution today. In her words, ``Dear Daddy, I miss you dearly. Thank you, Daddy, for making the world a better place.''May we use this resolution today as an opportunity to thank Mike Spann and to honor Mike Spann and the rest of the men and women fighting the war against terrorism, and for making this world a better place.Today as we commemorate the 3-month anniversary of September 11, the attack on this Nation, our hearts go out to all.Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus), who is a strong supporter of this resolution.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, last June, I had the privilege of attending the ceremony at which President Bush signed last year's historic tax cuts into law. This was quite an event, because it marked the enactment of the largest tax relief package in the last two decades.It was also an accomplishment because it reversed the backwards way that Washington often views tax dollars as belonging to federal government bureaucrats, not to working family farmers and small business people. This backwards view is particularly stressful to families when a family member has passed away.When someone who has paid taxes all of his life passes away, the death tax will still force surviving family members to pay up to 50 percent on the value of property of the deceased for tax year 2002. Fifty percent, even though the deceased spent a lifetime paying taxes on that very property. This is double taxation. With this high rate of taxation, families can be forced from their houses, off of their farms, and out of their businesses.Thanks to last year's tax cut, the death tax will be gradually phased out by tax year 2010. However, because of a procedural rule in the other body, the death tax will come back to life in tax year 2011. To keep the death tax in the grave where it belongs, I am pleased to serve as an original cosponsor of H.R. 2143, the Permanent Death Tax Repeal Act, sponsored by Rep. Dave Weldon of Florida, and urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.",

    "title": "DR. GEORGE V. IRONS, SR.'S INDUCTION TO THE ALABAMA MEN'S HALL OF FAME",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of Alabama's greatest native sons--Dr. George Vernon Irons, Sr.Dr. Irons recently received Alabama's highest posthumous honor--induction into the Alabama Men's Hall of Fame in Birmingham. The Alabama Men's Hall of Fame was created by the Alabama legislature in 1987. Its selection board is comprised of members from all seven congressional districts, the Governor, director of archives and history and the President of Samford University.Past inductees include America's most distinguished leaders: Wernher Von Braun, famed scientist who developed the rocketry to blast American astronauts to the Moon and return safely--a first in human history; George Washington Carver, botanist who mutated plants to give the south vital food sources; and James A. ``Brother'' Bryan, humanitarian, who gave sacrificially to fellow Alabamians during its severest economic times.Its most recent inductee, Dr. Irons, was distinguished professor of history and political science, Samford University for a near half century and one of the Nation's greatest athletes. Born in the ``Shadows of Gaineswood'' in Demopolis, Alabama in 1902, a century later, he is still breaking records. Dr. Irons is the only athlete inducted by the Alabama Men's Hall of Fame--the only Samford University Professor--and the only individual inducted by both the Alabama Men's Hall of Fame and the prestigious Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.While at the University of Alabama, he was first spotted by Coach Hank Crisp running across the campus--late to class. He promptly put him on the track team, where he broke a collegiate record the first time he ever pulled on a Crimson Tide uniform. Here's how a southern Governor described Bama's ``Chariot of Fire:''``Long before Bama had been to its first bowl game, before legendary Coach Paul Bear Bryant had won a game, Captain George Irons blazed a crimson streak across southern skies establishing an athletic tradition, smashing records in distance events as `Ironsides' and the `Knight of the Cinder Path.' ''As road racing champion (distance events begun at halftime of major football games and finishing as the halftime show--after a hill and dale course of about 4 miles), Bama's superstar was the ``best there ever was.'' Legendary Crimson Tide coach Wallace Wade (three time Rose Bowl winner) said Irons was: ``The greatest distance runner of his era.''He is the only Crimson Tide track man--the only distance man ever inducted by the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame--rare honors he may hold forever. Remarkably, some of his records still stand--nearly a century later.Pretty swift in the classroom too, Irons was Phi Beta Kappa honor graduate, Rhodes scholar nominee, earning his doctorate at Duke University. Dr. George Denny, president of the University of Alabama, appointed him assistant to the faculty beginning his ``longest run'' in higher education. He later joined Howard College (now Samford University) in 1933. He also distinguished himself in World War II, rising to the rank of colonel, serving 33 years active and reserve duty--a Samford record.Dr. Irons received Freedom Foundation's (Valley Forge, Pennsylvania), George Washington Medal of Honor for his speech in 1962 entitled: ``Freedom, America's Weapon of Might.'' It was broadcast worldwide on the U.S. Armed Forces Network. Irons was the first southerner to win this prestigious national award.Mr. Speaker, Dr. Irons was the only man elected by the Alabama Men's Hall of Fame from the 20th century. J. Lamar Monroe Curry, former Member of the United States Congress and Ambassador to Spain, was elected for the 19th century. To be considered, nominees must have strong connections to our State and have made a national or international impact in his profession.Dr. Irons taught seventeen students who became university presidents--a record in American education. His innovations in curriculum became a model for higher education across the South and Nation. A former student wrote: ``Dr. Irons was more than a teacher, he was an architect of the human mind. When he looked out to teach a class, he did not see simply students--he saw the mirror image of God.''His influence continues through the many students who were inspired by his life. It's no surprise his student roster included those who became captains of industry, Supreme Court Justices, Governors, law school deans and America's leaders.The induction ceremony was held at the club in Birmingham by the Committee of 100 Women (leaders of Alabama's civic and social communities) and the Alabama Men's Hall of Fame. Dr. Irons' son, Mountain Brook attorney, William L. Irons, gave a moving speech highlighting his father's contributions to Alabama and the American Nation. His bust was unveiled by Dr. Irons' great grandson, Dylan Alexander Irons of Charlotte, North Carolina.Inductees' busts are housed in the Alabama Men's Hall of Fame located in the Harwell G. Davis Library of Samford University. As inductee of both of Alabama's most prestigious halls of fame, Dr. Irons has placed a footprint where no man or woman has trod and should inspire future Alabamians.Mr. Speaker, I ask that the article in the University of Alabama Alumni Magazine, entitled: ``Knight of the Cinder Path,'' be included in the Congressional Record for America to share the achievements of this great American who served his university as distinguished educator a near half century, his country in war and peace for a third of the 20th century and his alma mater, the University of Alabama, as record breaking champion athlete and honor graduate.

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, on March 5 a year ago, President Bush boldly gave temporary trade relief to our domestic steel industry. I believe his plan is succeeding.It is my understanding that since 1973, Alabama's steel industry had steadily lost 16,000 employees, or about half the labor force. We needed a bold plan.I am proud to have supported the President and his initiative to stop the illegal dumping of foreign steel in the United States. His proposed Section 201 trade relief over three years was also intended to leverage negotiations to address the root cause of the world's surplus capacity, what the President called a ``50-year legacy of foreign government intervention in the market and direct financial support of their steel industries.''Well, a year later, some of our steel companies, including those in Alabama, are actually rehiring workers as domestic steel prices have firmed up, although they are still below the level two years ago. Also, to the best of my understanding, the critics' predictions of hefty price increases in consumer goods proved mistaken. And I am pleased that international negotiations are underway, thanks to the leverage of the Section 201 tariffs.The results of the President's leadership on steel look good so far. I urge him to finish his program on schedule.",

    "title": "FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE REFORM ACT OF 2003",
    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 522 which merges the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund, and which updates a successful program by increasing the standard maximum deposit insurance limit to $130,000 and indexing it every 5 years for inflation, doubling the new coverage level for certain retirement accounts and increasing the coverage amount for in-State municipal deposits.The FDIC deposit insurance system has served a critical role in the stability of our Nation's financial system. The reform to increase deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $130,000 will provide American savers the ability to better secure their nest egg while ensuring ongoing consumer confidence and the stability of the banking system. At an earlier time in history, a person may have felt it better to put their money in a metal box underneath a loose floor board in the house. At the other end of the spectrum would be the venture capitalists. They take risks, but that is their choice.The FDIC deposit insurance system creates some stability for the average person looking to secure some of their savings, not only for their retirement but for education and family needs as well. The increase in protection for retirement funds is significant not only for the overall picture, but also it is important that we pass this as reported out by committee.The image of a metal box brings up another point. If that money is in a bank as opposed to underneath a house, it obviously becomes part of the Nation's overall cash flow and investment system. This bill updates, at even less than the rate of inflation, the deposit insurance amount. That allows depositors who wish to put their funds in local independent banks to do so with confidence. In turn, those banks are able to approve loans related to local projects.I think even opponents of this bill in its current form would agree that competition is indeed good. For Congress to keep this amount of $100,000 is a not a harmless action. Not increasing the insurance amount in the face of 21 years of inflation in effect makes Congress a partner in the erosion of the ability of local communities to compete fairly with larger banks.References to the savings and loan crisis have to be weighed in the context of the actions taken after that situation by both government and industry.This bill passed last year by a vote of 408 to 18. I urge support today for this bill as reported out of committee and a ``yes'' vote on final passage.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Major Timothy C. Dunn NCOA Commandant of the 124th Regiment of the Vermont Army National Guard, a former member of the Alabama Army National Guard and Alabama native recently returned from Kabul, Afghanistan.While stationed in Afghanistan, his duties included mentoring and advising the Sergeant Major of the Afghan National Army. During his travels throughout the Afghan Army Battalions, he noticed that the Afghan Army was wearing different rank insignia from the American, French, British and Korean. Sergeant Major Dunn along with two other Sergeant Majors decided to create the insignia of the Afghan National Army. He wanted to create something that the Afghan National Army would be proud to wear.After the new rank insignia was completed, Sergeant Major Timothy Dunn met with the Afghan Ministry of Defense to see if they liked the idea. To the Sergeant Major's surprise, they liked the new insignia and immediately adopted the new insignia. It is still to be determined as to where the insignia will be located on the uniform. This will soon be decided by the Afghan National Army.It is with great honor and pride that Sergeant Major Dunn has served our country. To this day his exemplary service has represented our area and moreover this great nation. I applaud him for his courageous and meritorious efforts while serving in the United States Military.I want to publicly say, not only to Sergeant Major Timothy C. Dunn, but to all the troops serving our country, thank you for your hard work and dedication to this country.",

    "title": "MOURNING THE PASSING OF PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, what do you say about a man like Ronald Reagan that has not already been said? Ronald Reagan took the oath of office here in Washington D.C. in 1981 and, actually, just a short distance from where we are standing here this afternoon. At that time that he took office, I was 15 years old. I did not realize at that time the impact that this new President would have on this Nation and the world. I did not realize the moral and strong leadership that he would provide this Nation.Ronald Reagan served in the highest office of our land throughout my time in high school, college, and my first couple of years of law school. And with most of America, I listened to the tributes as they started pouring in over this past weekend. During the weekend and since that time, President Reagan's speeches, his remarks and comments have been played and reviewed time and time again.However, over the weekend I heard one speech that I had never heard before. It was a speech that President Reagan delivered at a prayer breakfast in Dallas, Texas, on the morning of August 23, 1984. It is so relevant to our situation today that if you did not know better, you would think he delivered the speech just a few days ago.He discussed religion and its role in the political life of our Nation. He made clear from the beginning of his speech that he was not speaking as a theologian or as a scholar, but rather as someone who had been around for quite a few years.He talked about the critical role in the political life of this Nation that faith and religion had played and, furthermore, how that had worked to benefit our Nation.He went on to say that the Founders understood that there was a divine order which transcends the human order. He then eloquently stated that he believed George Washington knew the city of man cannot survive without the city of God, and that the visible city will perish without the invisible city.While time will not permit me to discuss all of his remarks today, I would like to include his remarks in the Record that President Reagan made at that prayer breakfast in Dallas in 1984. Of course, it would not be appropriate to talk about Ronald Reagan without talking about how much he loved life and how much he valued life. He was a man of compassion, and people of all ages would do well to emulate Ronald Wilson Reagan.Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, very much. And, Martha Weisend, thank you very much. And I could say that if the morning ended with the music we have just heard from that magnificent choir, it would indeed be a holy day for all of us. It's wonderful to be here this morning. The past few days have been pretty busy for all of us, but I've wanted to be with you today to share some of my own thoughts. These past few weeks it seems that we've all been hearing a lot of talk about religion and its role in politics, religion and its place in the political life of the Nation. And I think it's appropriate today, at a prayer breakfast for 17,000 citizens in the State of Texas during a great political convention, that this issue be addressed. I don't speak as a theologian or a scholar, only as one who's lived a little more than his threescore ten--which has been a source of annoyance to some--[laughter]--and as one who has been active in the political life of the Nation for roughly four decades and now who's served the past 3\\1/2\\ years in our highest office. I speak, I think I can say, as one who has seen much, who has loved his country, and who's seen it change in many ways. I believe that faith and religion play a critical role in the political life of our nation--and always has--and that the church--and by that I mean all churches, all denominations--has had a strong influence on the state. And this has worked to our benefit as a nation. Those who created our country--the Founding Fathers and Mothers--understood that there is a divine order which transcends the human order. They saw the state, in fact, as a form of moral order and felt that the bedrock of moral order is religion. The Mayflower Compact began with the words, ``In the name of God, amen.'' The Declaration of Independence appeals to ``Nature's God'' and the ``Creator'' and ``the Supreme Judge of the world.'' Congress was given a chaplain, and the oaths of office are oaths before God. James Madison in the Federalist Papers admitted that in the creation of our Republic he perceived the hand of the Almighty. John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, warned that we must never forget the God from whom our blessings flowed. George Washington referred to religion's profound and unsurpassed place in the heart of our nation quite directly in his Farewell Address in 1796. Seven years earlier, France has erected a government that was intended to be purely secular. This new government would be grounded on reason rather than the law of God. By 1796 the French Revolution had know the Reign of Terror. And Washington voiced reservations about the idea that there could be a wise policy without a firm moral and religious foundation. He said, ``Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, Religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man (call himself a patriot) who (would) labour to subvert these . . . finest [firmest] \\1\\ props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere Politician . . . (and) the pious man ought to respect and to cherish (religion and morality).'' And he added, ``. . . let us with caution indulge the supposition, that morality can be maintained without religion.''",

    "title": "RECOGNIZING 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF APOLLO 11 LUNAR LANDING",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his leadership on this issue and for his leadership here in the Congress on this issue of space exploration for many years.Today, it has already been mentioned that we celebrate the accomplishments of NASA's Apollo 11 mission. Of course, it was back in 1961 that President Kennedy challenged NASA to meet the goals of sending people to the Moon and back. It was an exciting day only 8 years later when Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins represented all Americans when the first human steps were taken on the Moon.President Bush has issued a new challenge for NASA, the vision for space exploration. I wholeheartedly support NASA in this endeavor, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. NASA is important to this country's economic well-being, and it inspires our children to dream of distant worlds that they may actually see in their lifetime. It may be one of our children or one of our grandchildren who take the first steps on Mars.Although achieving the President's new vision may be some years in the future, we should all be aware of the many benefits and the spin-offs from NASA that reach all citizens of the United States, including those in each of our districts every day.NASA-inspired communications satellites connect the world. Other NASA-launched satellites enable weather forecasters to track hurricanes, wildfires, volcanoes, and also assist emergency workers in those areas to prepare ahead in time of events that could have devastating impacts. The NASA power source used to separate the solid rocket boosters from the Space Shuttle is used in Lifeshears, a rescue tool which quickly cuts debris to free victims when they have been in accidents.NASA has also made tremendous contributions to the medical field. NASA, technology first used to monitor the health of astronauts in space, has enabled health workers in today's hospitals to monitor many patients. One NASA researcher realized that his work study in small particles suspended in liquids could possibly help to detect cataracts, a condition that his father had suffered from. Now the instrument he designed is being adapted to identify other eye diseases, diabetes, and possibly even Alzheimer's.Another NASA researcher, driven by his own hearing problem, used expertise that he had gained as an electronics instrumentation engineer at NASA's Kennedy Space Center to develop the Cochlear Implant. This device has restored hearing for thousands and allowed others born deaf to hear for the very first time.A silicone chip originally developed for the Hubble Space Telescope makes breast cancer screening less painful, less expensive, and results in less scarring than the traditional biopsy.If that is not enough for you to support NASA's budget, consider their dedication to the youth of this Nation. NASA-sponsored or cosponsored programs such as the Student Launch Initiative, the Annual Moonbuggy Race and the Team America Rocketry Challenge reach out directly to our young people and inspire them to look within themselves to invent, create, dream and strive for accomplishments.NASA's Explorer Schools Programs have touched hundreds of minority and poverty-stricken communities to help educators in those systems with grants, materials, teaching guides and support for their math and science programs. NASA continues to benefit students even after they reach the college and university level through numerous grants, fellowships and programs.Through these and other programs, NASA and Vision for Space Exploration will inspire this Nation's youth, motivating future generations to study math, science and engineering. The work these young people will aspire to assists them to reach dreams beyond their imagination. What better memorial could there be for the noble astronauts who have given their lives in pursuit of space and exploration than to create a brand-new generation of explorers and visionaries?As I have detailed here, all citizens of the United States of America benefit in some way from NASA, whether from the thousands of jobs that were created in support of the programs, the commercial spin-offs from the research and technology developed, or by the impact of our young people through NASA's education initiative.I hope my colleagues this afternoon will join me as we look forward to supporting NASA's budget for fiscal year 2005 and as we celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Apollo mission.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I want to commend Chairman Knollenberg and the Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittee Staff once again for their hard work and efforts to produce an excellent bill for us to consider here today.The importance of our willingness here in Congress to immediately and effectively take care of the needs of our men and women in the Armed Services, and to look after their families, certainly goes without saying. It does not matter whether they are located here at home protecting our homeland security, or whether they are directly in harm's way while serving abroad to serve their country. We must support them in every way that we possibly can.This legislation represents a vital and immediate need for our troops and their families--to provide adequate and improved facilities for training and equipment; to provide better housing for these brave men and women, and their families, who unselfishly protect our national interests on a daily basis; to provide quality of life improvements such as chapels, child development centers, schools, and fitness centers; to better equip our hospitals and medical and dental facilities; for public safety and security here in our local communities; and to ensure the continued strength, construction and development of our overseas bases and our weapons systems that protect American interests.The sacrifice that these men and women have made to this Nation demands our attention and steadfast support to help them do the job that they have chosen to do, and to better their lives in any way that we can find. Many of you are concerned that this bill contains an increase on the cap on Federal contributions to the Military Housing Privatization program from $850 Million to $1.3 Billion in this Fiscal Year. This money is urgently needed to fully fund family housing construction and maintenance, and to eliminate inadequate housing that our troops must live in. This funding directly supports two bases in my home State of Alabama, at Redstone and at Fort Rucker, and I want to rise in support of the men and women serving there.Mr. Chairman, I rise today to thank the Chairman for an excellent bill, and to urge its passage to fully support these men and women in our Armed Services.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to mourn the death of Dr. James Rutledge, who recently passed away at the age of sixty-five. I am honored to stand before this body of Congress and this Nation to recognize his many accomplishments.Jim was born December 8, 1938 in Ironton, Ohio. Shortly thereafter his family moved to Ashland, KY where he graduated from Ashland High School in 1956, received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Kentucky in 1960, and attended medical school at the University of Louisville and received his Doctorate of Medicine in 1964 followed by a 2-year rotating internship.Jim joined the Air Force at the rank of Captain and served his country as a General Medical Officer at Warner Robbins Air Force Base and in Thailand during the Vietnam War in 1967 and 1968. He attained the National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal.Following his return from Thailand, Jim did a 4-year residency in Pathology at the University of Louisville and became board certified in Anatomical and Clinical Pathology in 1972. From 1973 until 1980 Jim was Pathologist and Medical Director of Laboratory Medicine at Greenview Hospital and Bowling Green-Warren County Hospital in Bowling Green, Kentucky.Jim was married to Rhonda Martin in Bowling Green, Kentucky on July 8, 1978. They moved their family to Jasper, Alabama in February 1980 and Jim began his work with Pathology Associates as Surgical and Clinical Pathologist and Medical Director of Laboratory Medicine at Walker Baptist Medical Center.Jim, along with Rhonda, supported good government by supporting candidates and the Republican Party in his county. As the years passed Jim continued to support many activities of the Republican Party at the local, state and national level. Jim was a man who loved his family and was devoted to them. He also loved and served his country with honor during his military service and as an active citizen dedicated to the security of our American heritage and the growth of good government.The Town of Jasper, Alabama benefited tremendously from his kindness and selfless service to his fellow citizens. During Jim's life he served others as a physician helping care for those who needed his oversight, knowledge and expertise in their time of illness. Dr. Jim Rutledge was a man who loved his God, his wife, his family and his country. He was a true American Hero to so many during his life. He was a man many depended upon--a man of little fanfare but deep wisdom and compassion. All who knew Jim were encouraged and uplifted because of having crossed his path. He was a quiet man, a man of great dignity and character who served others and took great pride in the accomplishments of those he helped and loved. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family, friends, and community at this difficult time of bereavement.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I would like to honor Jim D. Raby who is celebrating his 70th birthday. Jim is a man who embodies the American principles of hard work, dedication to one's family, and service to one's country and I am honored to stand before this body of Congress and this Nation to recognize this wonderful man and his many accomplishments.Jim was born on August 10, 1934 in the town of Jeff, Alabama. He grew up as a sharecropper in north Alabama, growing primarily cotton. He graduated from Monrovia High School in 1952 and briefly attended Andrew Jackson Business School in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1954, Jim joined the U.S. Navy and served his country honorably as a Seabee and as a Communications Technician.Following his discharge from the service, Jim began work in Huntsville, Alabama for the Army Ballistics Missile Agency (ABMA) as an electronic technician. There he had the distinction of working with the former German Rocket Team, including Dr. Werner Von Braun, during the infancy of the U.S. Space Program. In 1960, ABMA was transformed into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Jim joined the new agency as a Charter Member. He worked on almost every phase of the Pegasus, Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab programs.Jim's contributions included development of specifications and standards for electronic manufacturing, specifically soldering and crimp terminations as well as cable and harnesses. He installed many of these cables and harnesses in the original Mercury capsule. Jim then established schools for each of these subjects and performed lead activities in the fabrication of electronics for the Saturn and Apollo programs. Jim moved to various contractor facilities (as a NASA employee) throughout the United States to provide NASA guidance on manufacturing methods and techniques as well as providing Quality Assurance functions. He had the last word on flight readiness of electronic and electrical installations and in troubleshooting these systems when problems arose. The Moon landing during the summer of 1969 was the climax of this great era in Jim's life.Jim left NASA in 1975 to work for the U.S. Navy at China Lake, California. While at China Lake, Jim developed the Soldering Standardization Program which standardized requirements DoD-wide and the Solder Training and Certification Program. He also started the Electronic Manufacturing and Production Facility (EMPF).In 1984, Jim left the Navy to start Soldering Technology International, a family business in which he is still active. Soldering Technology International (STI) helps customers build more reliable electronic hardware. Under Jim's guidance, the company has twice been selected to INC Magazine's INC 500 list of fastest growing private companies. STI was also selected as Huntsville/Madison County's Small Business of the Year in the business services category for the year 2000. STI currently employs 45 people and has customers in all 50 states as well as 40 countries around the world.Of all Jim's achievements, he is most proud of his family--wife Ellen, son David, daughter-in-law Sheila, and beautiful granddaughter Ashley. He is also proud of the many friends and admirers that he has come to know over the years.Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege to honor Jim D. Raby for his many accomplishments and his enduring impact on his country, community and family. Jim has been and continues to be an inspiring role model for all of us, and I wish him the best of wishes on the occasion of his 70th birthday.",

I am honored to stand before this body of Congress and this Nation to recognize this wonderful man.Truman, a lifelong resident of Boaz, AL, in Marshall County, was born in 1931. Known by all as a wise, humble, loving, generous and prayerful man, his significant contributions to society fell primarily in three areas: Christian Fellowship, Community Service, and Education.Truman dedicated so much of his life to spreading the Gospel through his commitment to the Alabama State Gospel Singing Convention and the Bethany Baptist Church. He was an active member of the Alabama State Gospel Singing Convention for over 40 years, serving in various positions including President in 1972 and 1989 and subsequently serving on the Board of Trustees from 1992 until his death this year. Also, the congregation of his church benefited tremendously from his service as deacon for 45 years, a Sunday school teacher for 38 years, and as Choir Director for 17 years. As if this is not impressive enough, he also served as the President of the Alabama School of Gospel Music from it's inception in 1986 until his death.Mr. Glassco demonstrated outstanding leadership to the Boaz community as well. He held various offices in the Boaz Chamber of Commerce including President for 4 years and Secretary for 18 years. The Chamber further recognized his contributions to society when it selected Truman as their ``Man of the Year'' in 1987 and ``Educator of the Year'' in 1985. He was a long-time member of the Boaz Civitan Club, serving as President and holding various other offices. The Civitan Club recognized Truman's achievements by voting him ``Man of the Year'' in 1974.After earning three masters degrees, Truman served 38 years in public education, 22 years as a principal and 8 years as Assistant Superintendent of Education. Snead College named him ``Alumnus of the Year'' in 2004, an honor which was accepted posthumously by his wife, Dr. Bobbie Glassco. Although he never had children of his own, he was lovingly called ``Papa Truman'' by hundreds of young people.The town of Boaz, Alabama benefited tremendously from Truman's kindness and selfless service to his fellow citizens. I had the privilege of first meeting Truman Glassco and his wife Bobbie as a young boy at Antioch Baptist Church in Marion County Alabama at a convention singing. Many people can tell you that he was a ``real Christian man who made a real Christian difference in an indifferent world.'' I could not agree more. My thoughts and prayers continue to go out to his wife Bobbie, along with his family and friends. Yes, Gospel Music lost a dear friend when it lost Truman Glassco.",

Upon accepting the job, he stated that his one goal was to leave Auburn and the athletic department better than he found it. This goal was achieved.Mr. Speaker, I could go on much longer about this gentleman who was born and grew up in Pickens County, Alabama in the Fourth District but time does not permit this morning.It is a great privilege to honor David Emerson Housel for his many accomplishments and his enduring impact on his country, his community, friends and of course family. He is a man of great dignity and character who takes pride in the accomplishments of those he has helped over the years. David continues to be an inspiring role model for all of us and is the embodiment of the Auburn creed.I know I join the Auburn faithful and all Alabamians in wishing David God's richest blessing in his retirement.Mr. Speaker, today I have the privilege to honor Mr. David Emerson Housel on the occasion of his retirement as Auburn University's Director of Athletics. I am honored to stand before this body of Congress and this Nation to recognize his many accomplishments. He is truly a man who embodies the American principles of hard work, dedication to one's family, and service to one's community.David Emerson Housel was born on October 18, 1946 and grew up in the small, west Alabama town of Gordo. In 1956, at the age of ten, David attended his first Auburn University football game, a 34-7 victory over the University of Alabama at Legion Field in Birmingham. After the game he wrote letters to both schools asking for information about their football teams. David told the story to Mr. Neal Sims of the Birmingham News in the December 26, 2004 issue: ``Auburn sent a football guide, along with a note thanking me for being an Auburn fan. I got an Alabama media guide and a bill for two dollars''. As Mr. Sims reports: ``Alabama got its two bucks. Auburn got his heart, and together school and devotee have been linked ever since he grew from child to man.''David graduated from Gordo High School in 1965 and enrolled in Auburn University on June 9 of the same year. He graduated with a degree in journalism in 1969 and, after eight months with the Huntsville News (during which time he maintained a mailing address in Auburn) he returned to his Alma Mater to accept a job in the Ticket Office, where he worked from 1970 to 1972. He taught journalism from 1972 to 1980 when he rejoined the athletic staff as Assistant Sports Information Director, He was named Director in 1981 and Assistant Athletic Director in 1985.On April 1, 1994 David became Auburn's thirteenth Director of Athletics. Upon accepting the job he said, ``People may agree or disagree with decisions that are made, but they will never be able to question the reasons for those decisions. There will be no agenda other than the betterment of Auburn.'' His one goal was to leave Auburn and the athletic program better than he found it. This goal was achieved. Under David's leadership Auburn won seven team national championships (in the previous thirty-eight years Auburn had captured only one national championship). Auburn has won twenty-nine Southeastern Conference titles in the last ten years (in the previous ten seasons, Auburn had won eight titles). During David's tenure, the Athletic Department has posted its highest graduation rates ever. Also, the Department operated in the black financially every year, one of the very few Division 1A programs to do so on a consistent annual basis.Being the humble man that he is, David refuses to take credit for these accomplishments. Instead he gives credit to the Board of Trustees, the President, and above all, to the Auburn people. ``This is the work of Auburn people,'' he says. ``Whatever we have been able to accomplish is a direct reflection of Auburn people and their support of the school they love.''David is a past president of the SEC Sports Information Directors, a former chair of the NCAA Public Relations and Communications Committees. He served on the District III Postgraduate Scholarship Committee and has served as chair of the Dean's Council for Auburn's College of Liberal Arts. He also served as a member of the NCAA Championships Cabinet and the Executive Committee of the Southeastern Conference.He serves on the Board of Directors for Auburn Bank, the Auburn Wesley Foundation, the Lee County Red Cross and is a member of the Birmingham Pledge Advisory Board. He is an honorary member of the Auburn Football Lettermen Club and the University Singers. He is a member of the Sports Information Directors' Hall of Fame, the Tony Brandino Hall of Fame and the Gordo Athletics Hall of Fame. He is also an award winning free lance writer and has written two books, ``Saturdays to Remember'' and ``From the Desk of David Housel, A Collection of Auburn Stories.''In 1982 the Alabama Chapter of the National Football Foundation recognized David with their Contribution to Amateur Football Award. He has also received the Distinguished Service Award from the Walter Camp Foundation of New Haven, Connecticut and the Birmingham Monday Morning Quarterback Club for his career contributions to the sport of college football.Of all of David's accomplishments, perhaps his greatest achievement was convincing the former Susan McIntosh to marry him. Susan is a retired third grade teacher at Wright's Mill Road Elementary School in Auburn and they were married on June 15, 1985. David and Susan are faithful members of Auburn First United Methodist Church.Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege to honor David Emerson Housel for his many accomplishments and his enduring impact on his country, community, friends and family. He is a man of great dignity and character who takes pride in the accomplishments of those he has helped over the years. David continues to be an inspiring role model for all of us and is the embodiment of the Auburn Creed. I know I join the Auburn faithful in wishing David God's richest blessings in his retirement.",

    "title": "HONORING MR. DONALD G. WALDON",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Mr. Donald G. Waldon on the occasion of his retirement as the Administrator of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Development Authority. I am honored to stand before this body of Congress and this Nation to recognize his many accomplishments. He is truly a man who embodies the American principles of hard work, dedication to one's family and service to one's community.Don is a native of Columbus, Mississippi but grew up in Mobile, Alabama. He graduated from Mississippi State University in 1961 with a Bachelor's Degree in Civil Engineering and completed post graduate studies in science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1963 and Texas A&amp;M in 1964. He is a 1994 graduate of the University of Oklahoma's Economic Development Institute and the recipient of the Southern Industrial Development Council's 1994 Robert B. Cassell Award for Best Research Thesis.Don joined the Army Corps of Engineers in 1961, where he worked in Mobile until 1966, conducting feasibility studies for water resource projects such as ports and waterways, including some early ideas for the Tenn-Tom Waterway. In 1966 he went to work for the Office of Management and Budget of the Executive Office of the President where he advised OMB and White House officials, including the President, on major budgetary, policy and legislative matters involving natural resources.Don worked for OMB until 1974 when he was appointed as Deputy Assistant Secretary for the U.S. Department of the Interior, a position he held until September, 1975. His duties included management responsibilities for all land and water resource agencies within the Department of the Interior, which at the time had a budget of nearly $2 billion and approximately 12,000 employees. He had oversight over reclamation projects and the development of oil fields, coal mining on public lands, the Alaska Pipeline, the measures taken under the Nixon Energy Initiative, and served on a number of White House task forces, involving energy.In 1975, on the advice of Tenn-Tom project Administrator Glover Wilkins, Don entered an exchange program inside the Federal Government and came to the Tenn-Tom on a 2-year basis, but ultimately stayed for 30. In 1979 Don resigned from the Federal Government and remained with the Tenn-Tom, taking the position of Deputy Administrator. When Glover Wilkins retired in 1984 Don was appointed to the post of Administrator, a position he has held ever since.As Administrator of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Development Authority Don has worked tirelessly to promote the development of the Waterway, exploring economic and trade opportunities, and addressing potential barriers to the Waterway's beneficial use. Under Don's leadership the Waterway has resulted in approximately $5 billion in expanded industry. The Waterway has had a tremendous impact on the local communities, not just with industrial development, but by bringing in recreation and tourism dollars as well.Apart from his leadership of the Tenn-Tom Waterway Authority, Don is active in a variety of organizations devoted to the development of our waterways. He is President of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Development Council, Vice-Chairman of the National Waterways Conference, Inc., Director of the Inland Rivers, Ports and Terminals, Inc. (a national trade group representing inland ports), Executive Committee member of the U.S. Maritime Administration's Heartland Intermodal Partnership, Vice-President of the Alabama-Tombigbee Rivers Coalition and an Advisory Board Member of the Mississippi Water Resources Research Institute.Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege to honor Donald G. Waldon for his many accomplishments and his enduring impact on his country, community, friends and family. He is a man of great dignity and character who takes pride in the accomplishments of those he has helped over the years. Don is an inspiring role model for all of us and I join his friends and colleagues in wishing him God's richest blessings in his retirement.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate my colleague, John D. Dingell, of Michigan, on his 50 years of service in the United States House of Representatives this week. He is rightfully called ``the Dean of the House,'' as the longest currently serving Member of the House. Only two Members of the House have ever served longer, and Congressman Dingell's congressional career began at age 29, when he won election to succeed his father. John Dingell is known as a Member who is passionate about the welfare of the constituents he represents, and more broadly, all the residents of the United States. He shares his father's great passion for health care for all persons, and was key to the passage of many health care bills, including the Children's Health Insurance Program, and the Mammography Quality Standards Act. His work on health extends naturally to the environment as well, both in terms of holding polluters accountable for cleanup, and in working to preserve America's outdoor treasures for future generations. Michigan, of course, borders Canada, and Congressman Dingell has done outstanding work both in resolving pollution issues with Canada and in creating North America's first international wildlife refuge. As ranking member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and former chairman, John Dingell is known for his extensive knowledge and wisdom, and commands deep respect from both sides of the aisle. I am sure there have been many temptations over the years to leave congressional service for a more lucrative career, but it is a testimony to his dedication and integrity that he has reached this milestone in his career. I extend to him, and to his wife Deborah, and the entire family, my sincere congratulations.",

    "title": "THE CONGRESS ON WORLD AND TRADITIONAL RELIGIONS",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I commend President Nursultan Nazarbayev for his vision and commitment that made possible the recent Congress on World and Traditional Religions. It was a historic event. The remarks recently by Pope Benedict XVI, quoting medieval text, and the fierce reaction in the Islamic world underscore the need for an open and candid discussion, as occurred in Astana.At this year's forum, there were 43 delegations from 20 countries, including 43 representatives of Islam, Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, and other distinguished leaders. Though not all religious viewpoints may have been represented, the gathering had an impressive roster of participants--notably UNESCO Secretary General Koichiro Matsuura, United Nations Deputy Secretary General Sergei Ordjonikidze, particpated as well as NGOs dedicated to religious freedom issues. Cardinal Theodore Edgar McCarrick, past Archbishop of Washington, D.C. was among the delegates attending the event from the United States.The Second Congress on World and Traditional Religions convened at a time when the world is beset with conflict, regrettably much of it rooted in religious strife.At some point, religious leaders, and the governments who represent them, must rise above their differences, be they ethnic, cultural, geographic, religious, by seeking God's will as the best means of achieving peace and reconciliation in the world. And make no mistake, seeking common ground and mutual respect should not be viewed as a license for censure of thought or speech. Every human being has an inalienable right granted by God to believe as he or she chooses and to freely express that belief, whether as an act of worship or persuasion. Our common ground becomes soggy if we lose the ability to advocate for our viewpoint, while making sure we give due respect and deference to the viewpoints of others.President Nazarbayev, who is in Washington, D.C. this week at the personal invitation of President George Bush, and Speaker Nurtray Abikayev, Chairman of the Secretariat of the Congress, are to be commended for organizing this very important event.Mr. Speaker, though we may all have different ways to express or define what freedom of religious expression and worship means, we all agree that each individual must have the right to worship freely without intrusion of the government. Therefore, I commend gatherings such as the one that took place in Astana, Kazakhstan earlier this month, and I commend the country of Kazakhstan for hosting this event and believe many worthwhile and much needed issues were raised and discussed.I would also like to have included in my remarks the text of the Declaration of the II Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions.Declaration of the II Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional We, the leaders of world and traditional religions, gathered at our Second Congress in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan: Building on the success of the First Congress, which took place in the city of Astana on 23-24 September 2003 and engaged internationally recognized world religious leaders in an important initiative of inter-religious dialogue; wishing to help strengthen mutual understanding between cultures, religions and ethnic groups which form the basic components of world civilizations, and aiming to prevent conflicts based on cultural and religious differences; acknowledging that religion, having always been a fundamental element of human life and society has, at the beginning of the new century, assumed a significant new role in establishing and preserving peace; recognizing the great responsibility held by religious leaders for spiritual teaching and advocacy on behalf of current and future generations, and their vital role in establishing a spirit of mutual respect, understanding and acceptance in the face of new challenges; underlining the unique character of every religion and culture, and considering cultural and religious diversity to be an important feature of human society; expressing concern about increasing inter-religious and interethnic tensions in the world deriving from the exploitation of religious and national differences as a justification for violence which causes suffering to innocent victims; stressing that extremism and fanaticism find no justification in a genuine understanding of religion and that the vocation of all religions demands the refusal of violence and appeals to respect and peaceful co-existence with peoples and religions; believing that the difficulties in inter-religious and intercultural relations are related both to a fundamental imbalance in international politics, economics, social, humanitarian and information resources, and to the manipulation of religion for political ends; discussing and debating the above-mentioned concerns within the main theme of the Congress--``Religion, society and international security'' in the context of two special blocs. I. ``Freedom of religion and recognition of others''; II. ``Role of religious leaders in enhancing international security'' Appeal to people of all religions and people of good will across the globe, and: Call upon them to abandon enmity, discord and hatred; and embrace common respect and generosity, recognizing the reality of cultural, religious and civilizational diversity; declare our determination together to tackle and ultimately eliminate prejudice, ignorance and misrepresentation of other religions by placing particular focus on what religions hold in common as well as what distinguishes them; condemn all forms of terrorism on the basis that justice can never be established through fear and bloodshed and that the use of such means in the name of religion is a violation and betrayal of any religion that appeals to human goodness and dialogue; reject all false inventions and wrongly created stereotypes about the violent nature of religions and attempts to attribute terrorism to any particular religion; call upon all to work together to address and eliminate all causes of terrorism, thus promoting human flourishing, dignity and unity; declare our rejection of any form of pressure or violence to convert followers of one religion to another; reaffirm the pivotal role of education, youth policy and cultural activity for understanding, solidarity and social cohesion. We also call upon the global community, international and regional organizations, states and governments all over the world to: Actively support the process of intercivilizational dialogue; exert sustainable efforts towards creating a culture of peace, strengthening its principles as a firm basis of international politics and the life of all people; work to establish a more fair world, to consolidate international law and justice, and to implement UN resolutions and signed international agreements, and to find effective means of establishing peace and security all over the world; heed the voices of victims of oppression and terrorism and use all means to seek a just settlement of the existing conflicts, thus addressing the grievances that nurture violence; reject totally the development, production and possession of weapons of mass destruction and promote the strengthening of non-proliferation regimes; respect and protect the sanctity of religious symbols and places and take appropriate measures. Based upon the abovementioned, we, the leaders of world and traditional religions, resolved to: Take concrete collective measures for encouraging and highlighting positive perceptions of inter-religious relations by organizing joint meetings, seminars and addresses in the mass media, the Internet and other places of influence; strongly promote interreligious tolerance among younger generations to make them more devoted to dialogue and encourage them recognize universal values; integrate questions of the dialogue between civilizations and religions into curricula at all educational levels with a view to helping young people to respect and understand religious and cultural difference without hostility; use our spiritual influence, authority and resources to further establish peace, security, stability and contacts between each other in order to make a combined contribution to the prevention and resolution of disputes among different religious communities; offer our experience and best efforts to governments and people or groups and powers involved into conflicts in order to assist them in easing tensions, forming where appropriate joint delegations to conduct negotiations with them; commit to make efforts to promote and realize the goals stated in this Declaration, and to assign the Congress Secretariat to propose a plan for the best possible translation of these recommendations into reality; conduct the Congress of religions on a permanent basis and hold the third Congress of the leaders of world and traditional religions in 2009. For the Secretariat to present proposals on time and place of the next forum; bring to the attention of the General Assembly of the United Nations the conceptual and practical role performed by the Congress in promoting dialogue among civilizations, cultures and religions and its considerable achievements in interreligious understanding, inviting support for the further activity of the Congress.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chairman's support in allowing this bill to be brought to the floor to the House of Representatives today. I would also like to thank my friend, Mike Turner of Freedom Court Reporting in Alabama, who first brought this matter to my attention.I am pleased we have been able to work together with the committee of jurisdiction to find a satisfactory remedy to the issue of recognition of notarizations across State lines.During the hearings held on this bill by the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property, Ranking Member Berman pointed out that, ``Although the topic of notary recognition between the States is not necessarily the most exciting issue, it is an extremely practical one.'' To my colleague across the aisle, I would have to agree with both points.During that hearing in March, we heard from several witnesses who all agreed that this is an ongoing and a difficult problem for interstate commerce. To businesses and individuals engaged in business across State lines, this is a matter long overdue which is being resolved.H.R. 1458 will eliminate the confusion that arises from States who refuse to acknowledge the integrity of documents notarized out of State. H.R. 1458 would require that documents be recognized in any State or Federal court if the subject affects interstate commerce and the document is duly notarized by a seal or if a seal is tagged to an electronic document.Currently, each State is responsible for regulating its notaries. Typically, an individual will pay a fee, will submit an application, and takes an oath of office. Some States require applicants to enroll in educational courses, pass exams, and even obtain a notary bond. Nothing in this legislation will change these steps. It shall be made clear that we are not trying to mandate how States regulate notaries public they appoint. In addition, the bill would also not preclude the challenge of notarized documents such as a will contest.During the subcommittee hearing, the executive director of the National Notary Association stated, ``We like this bill because it is talking about a standard for the legal effects of the material act, the admissibility of it, not at all interfering with the State requirements for education and regulation of the notaries themselves.''Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for your support of this legislation and allowing the legislation to move forward today. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1458 under the suspension of the rules today.",

    "title": "TRIBUTE TO KAZAKHSTAN",
    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the country of Kazakhstan on the occasion of its 15th anniversary of independence from the former Soviet Union on December 16, 1991. Kazakhstan has been at the crossroads of trade and empires for centuries along the ancient Silk Road, and today plays an increasingly important role in the stability and security of the Central Asian region, and of our world.I had the privilege of visiting Kazakhstan along with Congressman Jim McDermott, Congressman Maurice Hinchey and former member Don Bonker in January of this year to see first hand the accomplishments that have been made since 1991. While in Kazakhstan we spent considerable time with members of the President's Cabinet and the current speaker of the senate, Nurtai Abykayev learning about current work going on in their country and their endeavors in making Kazakhstan a real leader in Asia and the world.In the first few years after independence, Kazakhstan successfully rid itself of the fourth largest nuclear arsenal in the world and closed the world's largest nuclear test site at Semipalatinsk, an unwanted legacy from the U.S.S.R., and continues to be a model for the global community. In 2005, the U.S. Senate unanimously adopted a resolution congratulating Kazakhstan on the 10th anniversary of the removal of all nuclear weapons from the country and commended Kazakhstan-U.S. cooperation in this sphere as a ``model.'' Earlier this year, this House unanimously adopted resolution 905 congratulating Kazakhstan on the 15th anniversary of the closure of the world's second largest nuclear test site in the Semipalatinsk region of Kazakhstan and for its efforts on the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.Kazakhstan condemned the terrorist attacks against the U.S. on September 11, 2001 and has been a staunch supporter of the U.S. led international coalition against global terrorism since. Kazakhstan provides free overflight rights and a major international airport for U.S. and coalition aircraft for operations in Afghanistan. Kazakhstan works with the international community to bring peace and stability to Iraq following the U.S. led campaign to end Saddam Hussein's regime. Kazakh military engineers in that country have destroyed more than 4 million pieces of ordnance since 2003.On a visit to Astana in 2005, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said, ``Today, Kazakhstan is poised and ready to break a path for a new Silk Road, a great corridor of reform . . . A strong and prosperous and democratic Kazakhstan will once again energize the global transmission of learning, and trade and freedom across the steppes of Central Asia. This nation has a glorious past and it is destined for a hopeful future. Kazakhstan's greatest days lie ahead of it. And the United States wants to be your partner.''During his 2006 visit to Washington President Nazarbayev and President George W. Bush signed a joint statement which says, ``We are satisfied with the progress made by Kazakhstan and the United States of America in the promotion of our strategic partnership, and announce our commitment to promote stability, prosperity and democratic reforms in Central Asia and outside of the region.'' The joint statement also stipulates the U.S. support for Kazakhstan's plan for accession to the group of the 50 most competitive countries in the world, according to the strategy of President Nursultan Nazarbaev, and for Kazakhstan's membership in the WTO. The document recognizes Kazakhstan's leadership in regional integration, considering its significant contributions in Eurasia and Afghanistan. The joint statement outlined a number of directions of the bilateral cooperation underlining ``we announce our intention to further strengthen our strategic partnership via strengthening strategic dialogues on energy, military collaboration, trade, investments and democratization. We express solid confidence that our enhanced strategic partnership will assists to security, prosperity and democracy development in the 21st century.''President Nursultan Nazarbayev has called for a massive transformation of Kazakhstan's political life and strengthening the country's move to democracy in a March 2006 speech to the first session of the State Commission. The priorities include significant strengthening of the role of the national Parliament, increasing the numbers of deputies in both houses of Parliament; continuing the introduction of elections of akims--mayors--at district levels, and the introduction of a bill on local self-government. ``Democracy is the choice of civilized people, and it is our choice too,'' President Nazarbayev said.Mr. Speaker, because of Kazakhstan's peaceful transition to democracy, its strong commitment to eliminating nuclear weapons, and her strong support for our country in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, I rise today to congratulate all her people on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of their independence.",

    "title": "IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, today is a day that we will look back on and know that fundamental decisions regarding our Nation's history were made.The discussions that we are engaged in will go a long way in determining our future in the ongoing global war on terror and Iraq's role in that fight. When this vote is cast on the non-binding, Democratic resolution, we will be sending a message to the world. The only question remaining is what message will we send?Will we say that America remains steadfast against the rising tide of hate and intolerance offered by militant Islamists? Will we say that we don't have the stomach to finish the fight against terrorists who actively seek to kill us and destroy our way of life?The war in Iraq has become such a flashpoint that we struggle to separate the politics of the situation from the reality. The politics attacks the intelligence that led us to war, questions our Nation's elected leadership, and condemns the decisions made along the way. It leads to the resolution that we now have before us. The reality recognizes that we are at war now and our troops are putting their lives on the line each and every day. It says that if this is a fight that we believe in, a fight against global terrorism, we must do everything possible to support the men and women who are carrying it out on our behalf and never giving a hint to the contrary.Unfortunately we are at a point today where some have forgotten exactly who and what we are fighting.Prior to 9/11, we failed to understand the hate of people like Osama bin Laden and what could result from it despite all evidence to the contrary. In 1979, 66 American diplomats were held hostage in Iran for 444 days; in 1983, 241 Marines were killed in Beirut when their barracks was attacked; militant Islamic terrorists bombed the World Trade Center in 1993; 225 people were killed in attacks on U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998; and, in 2000, 17 American sailors were killed when al-Qaeda attacked the U.S.S. Cole.Today we are at a historic crossroads: we either boldly tackle the issue of militant Islam that exists on the Iraqi front and is part of this world-wide struggle, applying the lessons we have learned from the years leading up to 9/11, or we approach the issue as we naively demonstrated before 9/11 and expect more attacks and more American deaths.The war in Iraq has gone on longer than any of us would have wished. We've seen too many funerals for too many sons and daughters, husbands and wives. To all those who have lost a friend or loved one, our hearts go out to you.It should be noted that mistakes have been made, of that there can be no doubt. We must know without question what led us to this point, and that time will come. But now is not that time. Not while we still have American service men and women in harm's way. History will play its part, teaching us our mistakes and urging us not to repeat them. But we don't have the luxury of waiting on history to pass its judgment.Without resolve, it is certain we will fail in Iraq and there will be far-reaching consequences for our Nation, the region and ultimately the world. Since September 11, there have been major terrorist attacks in Karachi, Bali, Moscow, Casablanca, Riyadh, Istanbul, Madrid, London and Amman. If we allow the terrorists present in Iraq to win, we can expect more of the same. We can expect to see another Afghanistan--a puppet government established to support and back the aims of their terrorist masters. This is totally unacceptable.Victory in Iraq is our only option. It is the only path through which we can hope for peace. Without victory, our terrorist enemies gain confidence in their opposition to the United States and their ability to defeat us militarily. We embolden them and offer them the opportunity to further their attacks against American men, women and children.The resolution that we are debating will send a message to the world. What will that message be? My fervent hope and prayer is that it will be a message of resolve, a message of strength, a message of victory.Now is the time to support our troops in the field unequivocally and vote against this nonbinding resolution. We don't want anyone to construe our action here today as not fully supporting our men and women who serve us in Iraq.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize Mr. Lucious Carroll Richardson, known to his friends as ``Sonny,'' who retired from the Alabama Department of Veteran's Affairs on August 31, 2006. He is a man who truly embodies the American principles of hard work, patriotism, dedication to one's family and service to one's community.For the past 30 years, the veterans in Walker County, AL, have had no better friend than Sonny Richardson. During that time he unselfishly served Walker County and the State of Alabama with great dedication and distinction. He worked tirelessly to ensure our veterans and their families received the benefits they had earned. His one driving goal was simply to help people. As Sonny once said, ``this job is not a position, it is a calling. If you are not interested in helping people, then you do not need to be in this job''.Sonny began his career with the Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs in January 1977. At that point there were approximately 6,800 veterans in Walker County receiving approximately $4,800,000 in benefits. Today, more than $19,400,000 in benefits are distributed to approximately the same number of veterans. It was also on his watch that a new Veterans Clinic was opened at Walker Baptist Medical Center in Jasper. In 1987, he rose to the rank of district manager and upon his retirement was supervising two different districts covering 21 counties in north Alabama.One of Sonny's better known accomplishments was his role in Walker County's annual Veterans Day parade. For 21 years he was the organizer of the parade. Due to his leadership the event grew to become the second largest Veterans Day parade in the State of Alabama. He turned over the reins as organizer 5 years ago to concentrate more on serving the needs of the veterans in Walker County. However, the Walker County Veterans Day parade continues as an annual tradition.Sonny is a veteran of the United States Army and retired with 20 years of service. During his military career he earned two Bronze Stars, one Meritorious Service Medal and four Army Commendation Medals and served in Korea, Germany and Vietnam. Upon retiring from the Army, Sonny went back to school and received his bachelor of science degree in criminal justice from the University of Alabama at Birmingham.He is the recipient of numerous awards for his service to the veterans and the community. In 1988 he was selected for the Fourth Congressional District Distinguished Citizen Award and was the Walker County State Employee of the Year for 1983, 1984 and 1985. He was also twice selected by the American Legion as the Veterans Service Officer of the Year.Madam Speaker, it is a great privilege for me to honor Lucious Carroll Richardson for his many years of dedicated service to our Nation's veterans. He has had an enduring impact on his country, community, friends and family. He is a man of great dignity and character who takes pride in the accomplishments of those he has helped over the years. It is clear that he has been a friend and advocate to the veterans of Walker County and the entire surrounding area. Madam Speaker, no doubt Sonny will be greatly missed in his position with the Department of Veterans Affairs. However, I know that Sonny will still remain a friend to those who have served their country. Sonny is an inspiring role model for all of us and I join his friends, family and colleagues in wishing him God's richest blessings in his retirement.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the Chairman's support for this legislation to be brought to the floor. I also want to say that I appreciate Congressman Coble, his lending his support for this legislation and making sure that it gets to the floor today. And as Chairman Conyers noted, Congressman Davis of Alabama and Congressman Braley of Iowa have been very helpful in this effort as well. So I'm glad to have their support.One other person that has been very supportive that actually called this to my attention initially was a friend of mine from Alabama, Mike Turner, some time ago brought this issue to my attention, and so I'm glad that we can work on this and try to get this resolved here on the floor of the House and through the United States Congress.I'm pleased to have been able to work together with the committee of jurisdiction to find a satisfactory solution to this issue dealing with recognition across State lines. During the hearing that was held during the 109th Congress, which has already been mentioned, by the Subcommittee on the Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property, then Ranking Member Howard Berman pointed out that though the topic of notary recognition between the States is not necessarily the most exciting issue, it is an extremely practical one. And to my colleague who, of course, now chairs that subcommittee, I would have to agree with him on both points.During the hearing, which was held back in March of 2006, we heard from several witnesses who all agree that this is an ongoing and a difficult problem for interstate commerce. To businesses and individuals engaged in businesses across State lines, this is a matter long overdue that is being resolved.H.R. 1979, the bill today, will eliminate confusion that arises when States refuse to acknowledge the integrity of documents from another State. This act preserves the right of States to set standards and regulate notaries, while reducing the burden on the average citizen who has to use the Court system.It will streamline the interstate, commercial, and legal transaction consistent with the guarantees of the State's rights that are called for in the Full Faith in Credit Clause of the United States Constitution.Currently, as the law is today, each State is responsible for regulating its notaries. Typically, an individual will pay a fee, will submit an application, takes an oath of office. Some States require the applicants to enroll in educational courses, pass exams and even to obtain a notary bond. Nothing in this legislation will change these steps. We are not trying to mandate how States regulate notaries which they appoint.In addition, the bill will also not preclude the challenge of notarized documents such as a will contest.During the subcommittee hearings on this bill that were held back in the 109th Congress, Tim Reineger, who serves as the executive director of the National Notary Association stated, ``We like this bill because it is talking about a standard for the legal effects of the material act, the admissibility of it, not at all interfering with the State requirements for education and regulation of the notaries themselves.''This is an issue that has really lagged on for many, many years. When I was first elected to Congress back in 1997, this was an issue that I was first made aware of, and here we are in 2007, and this issue is still not resolved. And this is an issue that people who deal with notaries on a daily basis deal with, to a lot of frustration.And simply, this legislation that we have before the House today and that will be going before the United States Senate, hopefully in a very short period of time, will address this problem. It will try to expedite interstate commerce so that court documents and so that when notaries are in one State or the other, they will be fully recognized.And again, I think it must be stressed that it is in no way trying to mandate what a State should do or should not do. It simply allows there to be more free flow of commerce between the States and particularly when you're talking about the regulation of notaries themselves.Again, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your support, Congressman Coble for your support of this legislation, and allowing it to be able to move forward today. And I would urge my colleagues that when this bill comes for a vote, that they would support it under the suspension of the rules. ",

The system meets a need for a defense mechanism which uses a non-explosive form of delivery and thereby can be mounted on helicopters without adding danger to the helicopter when it is fired upon. Recent meetings of the contractor with DOD have created a strong interest in possibly first deploying this system to protect ground vehicles. Funding of $3.2 million would have provided for the following activities, with perhaps more funding needed for the final phase; these plans will be adjusted, to adapt to the final Congressional figure above. Phase II, Task A Net Development R&D ($500k): Net Material, Ground vehicle version $80k; Aerial Platform $80k; 15 Range Tests/Parametric Studies/Validation, $100k; Labor/Salaries (Engineering and Manufacturing labor), $240k. Phase II, Task B Launcher Development ($1M): Ground and Aerial Launcher Design and Development R&D and Fabrication, $450k; 10 Range Tests, $75k; Labor for Engineering, Integration and Manufacturing, $400k; Travel to Govt Program Office Customers, $75k.

Present decontamination processes against Chemical & Biological (CB) Agents are very labor intensive and time consuming requiring in many cases the use of expensive equipment and considerable down-times for applying the process. The advanced prototypes generated under this program will demonstrate the capability of providing immediate on-site protection applicable against multiple threats. The decontamination system will be much less manpower intensive, storage stable, environmentally safe, compatible with a wide variety of materials and protective gear and have the capability to penetrate and adhere to surfaces. It minimizes the need for complicated after-the-fact decontamination processes and maximizes recovery of critical military assets. The advanced prototypes produced and field tested under this program will demonstrate a cost-effective protection technology for our military personnel and civilian population. The target completion date is 12/30/2010.Request as named in the report: Vertical/Horizontal Integration of Space Technologies and Applications (VISTA).Requesting Member: Aderholt.Bill Number: Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009, amendment of the Senate to H.R. 2638 the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act 2008.Account or Provision: Division C--Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2009 RDT&E--Army; Line 34 Command, Control, Communications Advanced Technology.Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Global Security & Engineering Solutions/L-3 Communications.Address of Requesting Entity: 654 Discovery Drive, Huntsville, AL Description of Request: $2,400,000 to the VISTA technology effort, to develop an application-based software program to integrate space and missile defense products and services with the tactical Army's Battle Command workstations using multi-agent and knowledge management technologies. When completed, this program will allow the warfighter to receive information on the battlefield from any U.S. asset, from any branch of the Armed Services, including satellite data. FY09 Congressional support will keep the program progressing and accelerate its delivery to the warfighter. The spend plan is as follows: Travel--$50,000; ODCs (Hardware and Software procurement), $50,000; Labor--$2,300,000: Broken Down by Task: Requirements Definition $225,000; Design $300,000; Implementation $350,000; Test $350,000; Certification $275,000; Event Participation (experiments, Army technology demonstrations, exercises and training events) $450,000; Fielding to Warfighter $350,000. The VISTA effort has demonstrated, in a laboratory Proof of Concept evaluation, automated space to specific unit threat warning capabilities across multiple networks. Missile Threat Warnings generated in the strategic Joint Data Network (JDN) were identified, analyzed and provided directly to the specifically threatened unit in the tactical Brigade and below network. These warnings were directly integrated with individually affected units equipped with either FBCB2 or C2PC Battle Command systems. This capability is being integrated into the Space and Missile Defense Battle Lab for experimentation during the fall of 2008. Additionally, this capability is in the planning and integration phases with the overall TITAN ATO effort with a planned demonstration at the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) On-The-Move (OTM) test-bed, Ft. Dix New Jersey, during the summer of 2009. This demonstration of the VISTA Information Dissemination and Management (IDM) intelligent multi-agent system is being sponsored by Battle Command Battle Lab-Leavenworth (BCBL-L) in coordination with the SMD Technical Center (SMDTC), Space Division, as well as CERDEC Command and Control Directorate (C2D) under a spin out capability from the TITAN ATO. The VISTA intelligent multi-agent system is also being proposed by BCBL-L (Battle Command Battle Lab at Ft Leavenworth) as a capability to enhance Battalion and below electronic warfare and IED Situational Awareness. The VISTA system would integrate WARLOCK (IED Sensor) systems with FBCB2 Battle Command systems. This potential VISTA spin-out capability has been briefed to the Army G-6/CIO and JIEDDO PMs by BCBL-L personnel. BCBL-L in coordination with SMDTC (SMDC Technical Center) has developed proposal to execute a two-year rapid prototyping of this capability into FBCB2. Congressional support will facilitate approval for the rapid prototype development. Based on progress to date, the DOD has decided to include this program in future budget requests, beginning with FY10.Request as named in the report: Radiation Hardening Initiative.Requesting Member: Cramer, Aderholt.Bill Number: Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009, amendment of the Senate to H.R. 2638 the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act 2008.Account or Provision: Division C--Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2009. RDT&E--Army. Line 55 Army Missile Defense Systems Integration.Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Analytical Services, Inc.Address of Requesting Entity: 350 Voyager Way, Huntsville, Alabama Description of Request: $2,400,000 for a Radiation Hardening Initiative (RHI) to provide an integrated design suite enabling simpler yet comprehensive rad-hard analysis that can be performed earlier in the design of systems allowing for satisfaction of rad-hard requirements, reduced cost/risk and better schedule adherence. Approximately 90 percent of the funding is for salaries of researchers, engineers, and software developers. Approximately 10 percent is for software costs, including the purchase of some COTS to improve the analysis capability. Radiation hardening is not a requirement typically made at the local or state level. The programs that require this capability are typically national defense or space programs. Many planned assets remain vulnerable to radiation environments. The RHI will integrate four related technology areas: (1) RadHard Component Catalog. (2) Automated design environments for military systems. (3) Radiation transport and effects models, including natural and man-made radiation environments. (4) System-specific accredited modeling and simulation tools. The integrated RHI products will encapsulate a comprehensive rad-hard design approach that predicts mission performance and system cost through use of proven components and simulation-based design trades.Request as named in the report: Autonomous Cargo Acquisition for Rotorcraft Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.Requesting Member: Cramer, Aderholt.Bill Number: Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009, amendment of the Senate to H.R. 2638 the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act 2008.Account or Provision: Division C--Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2009. RDT&E Army. Line 31 Aviation Advanced Technology.Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Advanced Optical Systems, Inc. Address of Requesting Entity: 6767 Old Madison Pike, Suite 410, Huntsville, AL 35606.Description of Request: $2,400,000 to develop and demonstrate completely unmanned cargo pickup and delivery, leveraging current developments for manned systems. This project will provide the Aviation and Missile Command with the development and demonstration of fully unmanned cargo pickup and delivery for logistics supply and weapons placement. The Army is currently developing a system for manned rotorcraft that will eliminate the need for a ground crew in external cargo operations. A completely unmanned cargo pickup and delivery system is the next logical extension, but currently this operational need is unfunded. Unmanned cargo operations would help reduce aircrew losses in situations such as those our armed forces are currently experiencing in Iraq and Afghanistan. Numerous Army UAS would benefit from this technology, and the technology would be applicable to other DOD UAS. These systems could also become useful for emergency evacuation. The spend plan is as follows: Army in-house: 10 percent--$240,000; In-house Labor: 60 percent--$1,440,000; Local machine shops 5 percent--$120,000; Local Radar subcontractor 15 percent--$600,000. The Army will supply an unmanned rotocraft, such as Fire Scout, A-160, or Unmanned Little Bird for testing. As a fallback, the Army may provide a manned helicopter for testing. The planned radar subcontractor is Phase IV of Huntsville, Alabama. Machine shops will provide custom hardware used in sensors, auto-attachment mechanisms, and for integration to the aircraft. Out of state vendors will supply parts such as lasers and computer chips.Request as named in the report: Brownout Sensor Visualization and Hazard Avoidance System.Requesting Member: Cramer, Aderholt.Bill Number: Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009, amendment of the Senate to H.R. 2638 the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act 2008.Account or Provision: Division C--Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2009.

Navy RDT&E. Line 16 Force Protection Advanced Technology.Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Hexcel Corporation.Address of Requesting Entity: 3300 Mallard Fox Drive, Decatur, AL Description of Request: $1,600,000 to continue the work of qualification of M65 Bismaleimide resin for the F-22, F-35, Long Range Strike, UAV's and other future programs. Qualification consists of the generation of design allowable data that enables engineers to design aircraft. Labor and salaries will account for approximately 80 percent of the costs; materials 10-20 percent.The currently qualified BMI system on the F-22 and F-35 is a very low viscosity resin that exhibits a high percentage of resin flow during cure. This high resin flow results in excessive variability in the thickness of the cured structure. To account for this, parts manufacture either adds excess material and machine to final thickness or add shims during the assembly process. In some cases, a structure will be assembled and disassembled three or more times to achieve the desired tolerances. M65 is a controlled flow resin that does not exhibit high resin flow during cure. The controlled flow nature of M65 BMI resin will allow the manufacture of net thickness structures that will not need post manufacture, machining, or shimming. Other benefits of the system include faster processing rates using Advance Fiber Placement (AFP) and suitability for co-curing sandwich structures. The increase in fiber placement will reduce the number of man hours for parts manufacture as well as reduce the cost for new tooling. There would be significant cost reduction benefit from reduced assembly effort, increased processing speeds, longer out times, and simplified sandwich processing for current and future DOD aircraft programs. In addition, the elimination of shimming will result in reduced and consistent structural weight. Initial trials of the new M65 resin system have shown a 50 percent increase in the speed of part fabrication on the existing fiber placement machines. This could easily save $60-80M in equipment cost alone, plus it will reduce the cost of the F-35 and F-22 parts by approximately 40 percent. Additionally, the ability to return to the large one piece parts, like the F-35 upper wing skin, will create a significant weight savings, which the F-35 program desperately needs. Finally, material cost savings would be realized by introducing M65 as a competitive, second source. The impact of savings can be derived from the F-18 example where 40 percent material cost savings were realized. Given the national security significance, it is also important to maintain U.S. skills in this process.Request as named in the report: High Fidelity Virtual Simulation and AnalysisRequesting Member: Aderholt.Bill Number: Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009, amendment of the Senate to H.R. 2638 the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act 2008.Account or Provision: Division C--Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2009.

Line.Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Science Applications International Corporation, (SAIC).Address of Requesting Entity: 6723 Odyssey Drive, Huntsville, AL Description of Request: $1,600,000 to leverage concept development/research across the operational spectrum. Funds will primarily be used for the salaries of engineers working on this project, with 10 percent or less possibly be used for hardware or software. The Lab cuts operational support timeline by using simulation-based analyses & experiments with man-in-the-loop. The System Simulation and Development Directorate (SSDD) of the Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is continuing to upgrade the capability of the Advanced Prototyping, Engineering and eXperimentation (APEX) Laboratory and is extending the application of detailed engineering level simulations across external networks in order to maintain the leading edge in modeling and simulation technology. The HFVSA is enhancing the SSDD's APEX Laboratory's capability to support deployed Soldiers through leveraging of the lab's concept development and research across the entire spectrum of operational environments. A key linkage to leverage the aviation and missile models and simulations is the use of existing Army simulation networks connected to Users in the TRADOC community to provide engineering level models and simulations in sufficient detail to properly examine mission needs. The APEX Lab is working to reduce the timeline necessary to support current and future operations using distributed simulation-based analyses and experiments with man-in-the-loop. Future improvements will increasingly be focused on accurately representing today's fight while also ensuring that research & development efforts supporting current and future weapon systems are conducted within accurate and meaningful operational environments throughout the life-cycle. The HFVSA program will provide relevant solutions to existing and emerging operational challenges. It will provide the ability for commanders to prioritize and gain consensus through relevant studies and analyses of alternative concept solutions. HFVSA increases the level of engineering fidelity available to Battle Labs and consolidates engineering resources between simulation communities/domains.Requesting Member: Aderholt.Bill Number: Senate Amendment to H.R. 2638.Provision/Account: Division D/Federal Emergency Management Agency.Legal Name of Requesting Entity: ``City of Rainbow City.''Address of Requesting Entity: 3700 Rainbow Drive, Rainbow City, AL Description of Request: Provide $1 million for urgent storm drainage improvements. The project would be one of several phases due to Rainbow City having widespread storm drainage issues. CDBG funding through ADECA has been applied for in the amount of $500,000 to address drainage problems in the City's only low income area. With local funds alone, this overall project would be completed at a much slower pace. However, the City is prepared to include the 45 percent local match in the general budget. The project is not eligible for completion with state funds.Requesting Member: Aderholt.Bill Number: Senate Amendment to H.R. 2638.Provision/Account: Division D/Coast Guard.Legal Name of Requesting Entity: ``Warrior Tombigbee Waterway Association''.Address of Requesting Entity: 250 No Water St., Mobile, AL 36652.Description of Request: Provide $4 million to the U.S. Coast Guard for the replacement of the CSX RR Bridge over Mobile River ordered by USCG Commandant as authorized under the Truman-Hobbs Act. Pending availability of funds, the design of the new bridge would be completed in November 2008 and ready for construction in FY 2009. The current estimated total cost of the project is $75.5 million; the federal share is $69.8 million. To date, the total amount of federal funds appropriated to this project has been $48.4 million. The potential $4 million appropriation would raise the amount of available federal funds to $52.4 million; hence an additional $17.4 million would be needed to complete the federal funding portion of the project presuming no increases in project cost before beginning construction.The Fourteen Mile Bridge received an average of $5.38M annually since fiscal year 2000. Progress is limited by availability of funds, inflationary pressures, and the significant increase in the cost of steel over the last several years. It is estimated that the construction duration for the new bridge will be two years.Requesting Member: Aderholt.Bill Number: Senate Amendment to H.R. 2638.Provision/Account: Division D/Federal Emergency Management Agency.Legal Name of Requesting Entity: ``Center for Domestic Preparedness'' (Federal Training Facility).Address of Requesting Entity: 61 Responder Dr., Anniston, AL 36205.Description of Request: Provide $62.5 million for the Center for Domestic Preparedness which is located in Anniston, Alabama.

    "title": "125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CENTRAL UNION MISSION",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I would like to bring the House's attention to an important milestone taking place in the District of Columbia. The Central Union Mission, the longest serving social service organization in the District, is celebrating its 125th anniversary of helping transform the lives of the least, the lost, and the last in Washington.Beginning in 1884, the Central Union Mission, a highly effective faith-based nonprofit, has provided a compassionate helping hand to literally thousands of the District's homeless and addicted men, women and children. For some veterans of the Civil War who returned to Washington down and out, they turned to the Mission for assistance and the Mission faithfully provided it. During the Great Depression, the Mission was the nexus of the City for many who were jobless and penniless. Veterans of two world wars enlisted the Mission to help them fight battles of addiction and homelessness.Just a short drive from this magnificent Capitol building, the Mission has been in operation continuously throughout 24 presidential administrations. The Mission has changed from what we would think of as a traditional homeless shelter providing food, clothing, and a safe place to sleep for the night, to a sophisticated transitional facility. The Mission provides emergency services to the homeless, life skills and job training, education and computer programs, group and individual therapy, clinical services, community work and outreach, and physical, emotional and spiritual renewal. Through a variety of programs, the Mission provides services to not just the homeless, but to the addicted, at-risk youth, gang members, and criminal offenders. The Mission accomplishes this important work with the strong support of and partnerships with foundations, associations, businesses, churches, other social services, and local governments in the District, in Virginia and Maryland.The Mission's work to the poor never seems to end. In fact, the problems of homelessness, addiction and other related problems continue to increase. The demand for programs offered by the Central Union Mission is more vital now than ever because of the severe economic crisis which hits hardest those who are most vulnerable.Today, in Washington, D.C., there are more than 12,000 men, women, and children who are living in shelters, transitional housing, or on the streets.Madam Speaker, the Central Union Mission is on the front lines working to meet the needs of those who are in need of its services. Last year alone, the Central Union Mission provided 152,275 meals to the hungry, more than 50,000 men with shelter through residential programs, and 4,408 individuals received counseling, medical, and legal assistance. Nearly 1,000 individuals were given the tools for a self-sufficient life through long-term addictions counseling and literacy programs.The impact doesn't stop there. Families with children are the fastest growing segment of the homeless population. This past year, the Mission provided nearly 5,000 families with clothing, food, and household goods; more than 3,000 children were given backpacks, supplies for school, and gifts around Christmas time; and hundreds of impoverished urban children were treated to a real summer camp experience at the Mission's Camp Bennett location in Maryland.The demand for services provided by the Central Union Mission continues to grow. The Central Union Mission is regularly forced to turn away people who are hungry, hurting, and in need of vital services because of regularly operating to capacity. As we enter the winter months, the Mission becomes an even more critical safety net for thousands of individuals and families who seek out the warmth and shelter it provides.The assistance the Central Union Mission has provided since 1884 is best told through the stories those whose lives have been transformed. One such person, ``Timothy,'' says about the Mission:For nine years I had been struggling with drug and alcohol addiction. Going in and out of jails and institutions, wandering, hopelessly waiting for my life to end or a miracle to happen. At some point, I decided I didn't want to live anymore. My wife and children had been gone from my life, and my life was in shambles. I decided, during a deep depression, that I was going to take my own life. Then, the miracle happened. I walked to the Central Union Mission, which was only 4 blocks away. When I arrived I was embraced by men who were concerned for me. I came into their STP program with barely any hope. But several days into it, I started to feel better. I realized that I have certain responsibilities, and that life is really what you make it. Somehow, I made it through the Mission's program and my life has really turned around. Today, my wife and children know me, they're proud to say they have a changed husband and daddy. My relationship with my family has been restored, my sanity has been given back, and I look forward to a better future. All thanks to the Central Union Mission.``Reginald'' had a similar experience:I entered Central Union Mission depressed, tired of life, and sick. I needed help. I was at the Mission for almost two weeks, which allowed me time to recuperate, think, and spend time with other men who were just like me, when my mind began to clear. I started to focus on the important things in my life--my faith, family and getting better. The Mission is just what it says it is--a mission, a place that's there for the people who are in need, and so they can get better. Just watching all these people bring in donated things to help people they don't even know amazed me. Watching men and women who have very little, like me, enjoy working on the food depot, seniors day, birthday celebrations, back to school, and things like that, makes it seem more like a family here. Basically, they really care. It helps me to realize how important I really am. I thank God for David Treadwell and his staff. They are wonderful at what they do for people in need. The time they put into helping us is from the heart and that's what God wants from all of us--the best of what's in our hearts.Madam Speaker, I hope the House will join me in congratulating the Central Union Mission and expressing our gratitude for the vital work the Mission is doing here in Washington, D.C. I encourage all Members to visit the Mission, which is just a short drive from this chamber to witness first-hand the power of compassionate service that has helped the Mission transform so many thousands of lives of the least, the last, and the lost for 125 years.",

    "text": "I just want to thank the Chair and the ranking member for their work on this subcommittee bill. As a ranking member on one of the subcommittees on Appropriations, I know the work that goes into these bills and putting them together, and I thank Mr. Dicks and Mr. Simpson for their hard work on this appropriation bill.I would like to talk a little bit about this project. The amendment that has been brought up tonight by Mr. Campbell is an amendment that would, of course, eliminate funding for what I believe is a worthy and historic preservation project.The funding allows the City of Fort Payne, which is a town located in the district that I represent, a relatively small town in rural Alabama, to proceed with this rehabilitation project of an important landmark, as has been stated, the Fort Payne Coal and Iron Building. Also, it should be noted, Madam Chair, that this is included in the Save America's Treasures program.Fort Payne was first incorporated as a town in 1889 as investors from New England saw coal and iron opportunities in the surrounding areas. During that time period, this particular building, the Fort Payne Coal and Iron Building, was the first building that was constructed. It served as the administrative building and the headquarters for the Fort Payne Coal and Iron Company, and it was from this building that the city itself was planned. This year marks the 120th anniversary of the building as well as the town of Fort Payne.This has been a project that they are not depending on Federal funds alone, and that's, of course, as Mr. Campbell pointed out. The City of Fort Payne in rural Alabama has spent $50,000 of its own money working on this project. The State of Alabama has committed another $135,000 for this project. The Coal and Iron Building will house a cultural center which will serve this region of the State. The building is on the national register, and it will be a valuable asset of increasing tourism and raising awareness of the cultural heritage of northern Alabama and southern Appalachia, as it will provide educational opportunities which augment certain other activities in the region.",

He traveled across the country during the Great Depression and returned home to Berry, Alabama, and then on to Fayette, Alabama. Today he resides in Tuscaloosa.Mr. Kimbrell entered politics and served in the Alabama State Senate for the 12th District of Alabama, and he also managed Big Jim Folsom's gubernatorial campaign in 1954. Additionally, he went on to serve as an adviser to several successive governors in the great State of Alabama.Until his retirement in 1984, he owned and operated Fayco, which was located in Fayette, Alabama, which is in the district I am privileged to represent.Mr. Fuller Kimbrell has served on various civic and committee organizations such as the Lions Club, the Fayette Chamber of Commerce and the Alabama Farm Equipment Association, as well as the Alabama Road Builders Association, just to name a few.Mr. Kimbrell has made so many great contributions to Alabama and our Nation. It is an honor to pay tribute to this great Alabamian and this great American. I am thankful to know Mr. Fuller Kimbrell, who is an inspiring example to all of us. I look forward to having the benefit of his wise counsel for many years to come, and I wish him a very happy birthday this Saturday.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Madam Speaker, this is my first appropriation bill to help manage on the floor, and I have very much enjoyed the process and consider it a real privilege to have this honor to do it.I do want to commend the Chair, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, for her professional and her courteous manner in the way that she has conducted the process over the last several months for producing the fiscal year 2010 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill. We have worked closely and very much in the spirit of bipartisanship to meet the funding needs of the legislative branch agencies. In addition, the Chair operated under an open process and was responsive to the concerns and input of all the members of this committee.Madam Speaker, I will say it is unfortunate that the bipartisan approach taken by our committee stopped at the doors of the Rules Committee. I understand that the rule accompanying this bill, the Legislative Branch Appropriation bill, has historically been a structured rule. Traditionally, while not all amendments filed with the Rules Committee have been made in order, a much more balanced approach has been taken than what we are seeing today. Twenty amendments were filed with the Rules Committee and only one was made in order. While I may not have personally supported some of the amendments, I do feel strongly that Members should be permitted to debate the issues of concern to them. Members have once again been denied the right to offer amendments to an appropriation bill, a trend that's happening more often than not.That being said, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, did its work and we addressed the many competing priorities and individual agency challenges.The committee has reduced the fiscal year 2010 requested increase of 15 percent down to 6.8 percent, a reduction of $282 million. However, it is important to distinguish that nearly one-quarter of this increase, or $60 million, is for the establishment of the Historical Buildings Revitalization Trust Fund. When you take this into account, the agencies will be operating on an average of a 5.2 increase over the last year. This funding allows the committee to continue to focus on critical life safety issues surrounding the Capitol complex and to maintain adequate funding of current staff operations.Among the highlights of the bill is $1.375 billion for the expenses of the House of Representatives. This provides an appropriate level of funding for the Members' representational allowances, the ability to address the much-needed new voting system, additional benefits for House employees, and a new House I.D. badge system. For the United States Capitol Police, $325 million will be included. This amount supports the current sworn strength at 1,799 positions and fully funds the implementation costs of the merger with the Library of Congress Police. The Architect of the Capitol, excluding Senate items, is funded at $541 million and supports the top 20 construction projects. All life safety projects, significant investment in energy and saving efforts, and almost $70 million worth of deferred maintenance projects have been funded in this bill.And we have started a very needed new initiative, the Historic Buildings Revitalization Trust Fund, to begin to address the Capitol complex's deteriorating infrastructure. For the Library of Congress, $647 million is included, and it includes $15 million for the beginning of needed new technology investments. The Government Printing Office is to continue the development of the Federal digital system and is included at $7 million, and in order to meet the congressional demands, additional workforce is provided for the Congressional Budget Office and the Government Accountability Office.In conclusion, H.R. 2918 is a well-rounded bill and adequately addresses the needs of the legislative branch.Again, I would like to express my thanks to the Chair for her bipartisanship and how she has conducted this subcommittee over the last several months that we've had the hearings and as we have worked together on this bill. I also do want to thank the majority staff, Mike Stephens, David Marroni, Matt Glassman, and Ian Rayder, for their help with this bill; and, of course, on my side of the aisle, on the minority's side, Liz Dawson, Jennifer Kisiah, and Megan Medley with my office to make sure that this bill goes through as it has successfully over the last several months. So, again, I thank all the people who were involved.Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.Madam Speaker, at this time I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Illinois.",

    "title": "CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2918, LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Madam Speaker, I am privileged to have had an opportunity to work this year with the chairman of this subcommittee, Ms. Wasserman Schultz. And let me just echo what she was saying about all the staff that has helped on the majority and minority this year in putting this bill together. It is a good bill. We have worked very well together, all the subcommittee members on the minority and the majority side. So I am very happy to report that she has worked in a very open manner through this entire process, been very responsive to the concerns and input of all the members of the subcommittee.We have worked very closely, and we have worked in a spirit of what I consider real bipartisanship for the needs of the legislative branch. I think it would be fair to say that Ms. Wasserman Schultz has actually gone beyond the call of duty to make sure that this has been a fair process, along with all of her staff on the majority side. So I again want to especially thank the majority and the minority staff for all their work in putting this together, because certainly they do great work in making sure that what we need is put before us.Division A of this conference report represents the efforts of the conferees to bring back to the House an agreement which was comprised in a bipartisanship manner and continues the priorities of the House of Representatives. The conference provides a total of $4.656 billion, which is an increase of $155 million, or 3.4 percent, over fiscal year 2009.Among the highlights of the agreement are:$1.369 billion for the House of Representatives. This provides an appropriate level of funding for the Members' representational allowance;$328.3 million for the Capitol Police. This amount supports the current level of 1,799 officers and completes the Library of Congress Police merger; $602 million for the Architect of the Capitol. This includes a special emphasis on funding life safety and rehabilitation of critical infrastructure. Also, there is $50 million for a new House Historic Buildings Revitalization Trust Fund to more evenly spread out the cost of repairing and revitalizing the historic icon buildings such as the Cannon House Office Building.Also included in the bill is $643 million for the Library of Congress. This amount includes $15 million to fund the first year of the Library's 5-year information technology initiative.There is $147 million for the Government Printing Office. This amount includes $7.8 million to continue the development of the Federal Digital System.Funds are also provided for additional workforce to meet the congressional demands for the Congressional Budget Office and the Government Accountability Office.Our conferees did their work and addressed many of the competing priorities and individual agency challenges that come with this particular piece of legislation. I know that the chairman of the committee, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, feels as I do, that it is nice to have this piece of legislation behind us so that we can move forward. We have been working on this legislation since the very first part of the year, and I know it will be a great birthday present for the chairman, as she celebrates her birthday this weekend, to have this bill behind us. But I am very thankful for the work that we have put in together.That being said, I think it is important that I stress the point that I am disappointed that the process has brought us to where we are on this Legislative Branch Appropriations bill because it has turned out to be the vehicle for the continuing resolution. This is simply not a reasonable or responsible kind of governing that our constituents sent us here to Washington to do.As the ranking member of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee, I believe, of course, this bill is very important; but moving this bill forward first, even before Homeland Security and the security of the Nation, is not the proper way to prioritize funding or to meet the critical needs that face the American people.Madam Speaker, we need a clean continuing resolution and a clean Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, which is what this committee was prepared to do. And while I support the underlying bill and the underlying work that is in this bill, I regret that because of the attachment of the continuing resolution to this conference report I am unable to support this agreement in the House this morning.Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.Madam Speaker, at this time, I will continue to reserve.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, it is an honor to pay tribute to a great American servant in light of his passing on September 2, 2009, former Congressman Bill Hefner, who died of a brain aneurysm at the age of 79 years old.Bill Hefner served for 24 years in the House of Representatives and was a committed and devoted husband and father.Mr. Hefner joined the U.S. House back in 1975 and was later considered the dean of North Carolina's U.S. House delegation. He represented the Eighth Congressional District of North Carolina, which includes cities like Charlotte suburbs, Kannapolis and Concord and other cities like Monroe and Laurinburg. He served in Congress from January 3, 1975 until January 3, 1999.I had the honor to also serve with Bill Hefner on the House Appropriations Committee. As a member of the Committee he fought for funding for Fort Bragg in his home state when he was chairman and later ranking minority member of the military subcommittee.Mr. Hefner also prided himself in working very hard on veterans' issues and transportation projects that benefited the entire East Coast.Having spent much of his life growing up in the district I represent, Bill Hefner decided to retire in the Fourth Congressional District of Alabama. In 1998, Bill Hefner moved to Guntersville in Marshall County to enjoy the beauty that North Alabama has to offer.After his time in Congress, his days of public service were not over. Congressman Hefner served from October of 2001 until November of 2002 as a District Commissioner for Marshall County, Alabama.What most people don't know about Bill Hefner is that the 12-term Democratic Congressman was also a southern gospel singer and was a founding member of the very popular Harvesters Quartet, which began in 1953 in Charlotte, North Carolina.Mr. Hefner was born in Elora, Tennessee and graduated from high school in Sardis, which is located in North Alabama. He graduated college from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.Mr. Hefner leaves behind his wife, Nancy, and two daughters, Stacey and Shelly. Our prayers and condolences go out to his family and the many fans of southern gospel music, like myself, who will always remember his great tenor voice.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, there is bipartisan consensus that Congress must help with affordability, with access and with the availability of health care for American families. There is no question that Congress must act and that we must address the issues, but the current Democrat health plan is not going in a bipartisan direction. Not only is the current Democrat health plan the wrong approach; it could harm various groups of Americans who need and who depend on quality health care the most.One of the groups is seniors. In my home State of Alabama, seniors make up about 14 percent of the population. That's higher than the national average. The seniors in Alabama and all over America deserve something better than the government takeover of health care.The House Democrat plan includes massive cuts to Medicare that will result in Medicare Advantage plans dropping out of the program, limiting seniors' choices and causing many to lose their current health care coverage, and cuts to Medicare Advantage will have an exceptionally harmful impact on seniors in rural areas.",

However, a solution to the high cost and unrealized weight benefits of these structures is badly needed. Studies done in conjunction with the major aircraft manufacturers show that while composite material properties predict a weight savings of about 50% is achievable, only about 10-20% is being realized in today's designs. The problem is that the composite materials that are currently available in the marketplace cannot be formed into the complex geometries necessary to realize the true weight savings available. This results in pressure at the design stage to reduce the complexity of parts so they are more fabrication friendly. If the designer holds firm on the part complexity, automated fabrication techniques are often ruled out due to the challenges of forming complex geometries with these processes. The end result is added weight and cost to the structure. Stretch Broken Carbon Fiber (SBCF) technology affords more weight reduction opportunities than any other solution under evaluation by the DoD. SBCF product forms offer a pseudo plasticity akin to metals that makes the forming of complex geometries much easier. These products can be used in all of the automated composite processes currently being used by fabricators including fiber and tape placement and engineered textile approaches for fabricating net shape preforms used in resin infusion processes. The focus of this program will be two-fold. First, funding will be allocated to various composite part fabricators to develop robust processes to mold full size prototype parts with SBCF product forms. Second, funding will be allocated to generate a Mil-HdBk-17 approved database. Both tasks are necessary to take this technology into production.Request as named in the report: Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research GroupRequesting Member: AderholtBill Number: H.R. 3326--the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, Account or Provision: RDT&E--Defense-ArmyLegal Name of Requesting Entity: Children's National Medical CenterAddress of Requesting Entity: 111 Michigan Avenue, NW., Washington, Description of Request: $3,280,000 for funds will be used for ongoing research and testing using molecular patches, to see if the same improvements experienced by dogs in clinical trials can be extended to humans with muscle damage.

Through the use of sensors, networks, and software-based controllers, RMAT will provide the means for monitoring and troubleshooting various shipboard systems that are vital to ship operations, and allow engineers from various shore-based locations to collaborate in a real-time secure environment. RMAT will enable faster response times and mitigation of damage caused by engineering casualties, blast, fire, flooding, and equipment malfunction. Implementation of RMAT will increase the level of sensor data fusion, situational awareness, and survivability of the ship, as well as its ability to successfully complete its mission. The change from analog systems and manual data collection will save thousands of man-hours every year. Without funding for this effort, a need will exist to continue maintenance of obsolete hardware-based control panels and large redundant watch-standing and damage control repair parties that rely on slow, outdated, and error producing control systems and information management techniques.Request as named in the report: Transitioning Stretch Broken Carbon Fiber to Production ProgramsRequesting Member: AderholtBill Number: H.R. 3326--the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, Account or Provision: RDT&E--Defense--ArmyLegal Name of Requesting Entity: Hexcel CorporationAddress of Requesting Entity: 3300 Mallard Fox Drive, Decatur, AL Description of Request: $3,200,000 for composite structure on existing military aircraft has saved weight and reduced O&M costs. However, a solution to the high cost and unrealized weight benefits of these structures is badly needed. Studies done in conjunction with the major aircraft manufacturers show that while composite material properties predict a weight savings of about 50% is achievable, only about 10-20% is being realized in today's designs. The problem is that the composite materials that are currently available in the marketplace cannot be formed into the complex geometries necessary to realize the true weight savings available. This results in pressure at the design stage to reduce the complexity of parts so they are more fabrication friendly. If the designer holds firm on the part complexity, automated fabrication techniques are often ruled out due to the challenges of forming complex geometries with these processes. The end result is added weight and cost to the structure. Stretch Broken Carbon Fiber (SBCF) technology affords more weight reduction opportunities than any other solution under evaluation by the DoD. SBCF product forms offer a pseudo plasticity akin to metals that makes the forming of complex geometries much easier. These products can be used in all of the automated composite processes currently being used by fabricators including fiber and tape placement and engineered textile approaches for fabricating net shape preforms used in resin infusion processes. The focus of this program will be two-fold. First, funding will be allocated to various composite part fabricators to develop robust processes to mold full size prototype parts with SBCF product forms. Second, funding will allocated to generate a Mil-HdBk-17 approved database. Both tasks are necessary to take this technology into production.Request as named in the report: Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research GroupRequesting Member: AderholtBill Number: H.R. 3326--the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, Account or Provision: RDT&E--Defense--ArmyLegal Name of Requesting Entity: Children's National Medical CenterAddress of Requesting Entity: 111 Michigan Avenue, NW., Washington, Description of Request: $3,280,000 for funds will be used for ongoing research and testing using molecular patches, to see if the same improvements experienced by dogs in clinical trials can be extended to humans with muscle damage. The funds will be used for ongoing research and testing using molecular patches, to see if the same improvements experienced by dogs in clinical trials can be extended to humans with muscle damage.

However, the President and the Democrat leadership of this body are forcing us to vote on this bill.In many countries, people have no free speech. But in America we do. So on behalf of all the families in north Alabama that I represent, I say to my colleagues in Congress, reject this massive takeover of health care that we are to vote on in the next 24 hours.To make this legislation even worse, no amendment is being allowed to stop abortions from being federally funded. Members of the majority are not even being allowed to bring up a vote on abortion, one of the issues that means most to Americans. Businesses will be crippled with new taxes, and they won't be able to hire out-of-work Americans.America has never gone down this road, Madam Speaker, the road for government-controlled health care. And never in our history have we forced individuals to actually purchase insurance. As I was walking into the Chamber this afternoon to cast my votes, there were literally thousands of people outside the Capitol. They were shouting their opposition to this bill, and it was loud and clear.Madam Speaker, these people are still out there, and the message is still the same. And it is loud and clear: No government-controlled health care. Kill this bill.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I appreciate the chairman's support for this legislation to be brought to the floor, and of course the support of Ranking Member Smith on this legislation as well. Without it, this legislation, we would not be here today where we are.One other person who has been very supportive and who actually brought this to my attention several years ago is my friend Mike Turner, from Birmingham. We've worked together on this to try to resolve this issue through the United States Congress, and so here we are, as mentioned, the third time to try to resolve this.There is an old saying, ``The third time's the charm,'' and I am hopeful today that saying holds true. As my colleagues who serve on the Judiciary Committee are well aware, today marks the third time that the House of Representatives has brought up, and hopefully will pass, this bill. The key, of course, lies with our friends in the other Chamber. So I look forward to working with our colleagues in the Senate and getting the bill moved through that Chamber as well.I was first made aware of this problem, as I say, by my friend Mike Turner when I was first elected to Congress back in 1997. Here we are in 2010. The issue is still not resolved. This is an issue of great frustration to people who deal with notaries on a daily basis.Several years ago, the House Judiciary Committee worked with supporters of this issue to find a satisfactory solution to the problem of the recognition of notarizations across State lines. In March of 2006, the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property heard from several witnesses who all agreed that this is an ongoing and difficult problem for interstate commerce. To businesses and individuals engaged in businesses across State lines, this is a matter long overdue.In a nutshell, as it has been stated, H.R. 3808 will expedite interstate commerce so that court documents and other notarized documents will be fully recognized from one State to another. Today States can refuse to acknowledge the integrity of notarized documents from one State to another. This legislation, H.R. 3808, will streamline the interstate, commercial, and legal transactions consistent with the guarantees of the States' rights that are called for in the full faith and credit clause of the United States Constitution.This legislation preserves the rights of States to set standards and regulate notaries, while reducing the burden on the average citizen who has to use our court systems. Currently, as the law stands today, each State is responsible for regulating its notaries. Typically, an individual will pay a fee, they will submit an application, and they will take an oath of office. Some States require the applicants enroll in educational courses, to pass exams, and even obtain a notary bond. Nothing in this legislation will change those steps. Please know we are not trying to mandate how States regulate notaries which they appoint. The bill will not preclude the challenge of notarized documents such as a will contest.Again, I want to stress that this is in no way trying to mandate what a State should do or what a State should not do. It simply allows there to be more free flow of commerce between States, and particularly when you are talking about the regulation of notaries themselves.Again, I want to thank the chairman and also the ranking member for their support of this legislation to allow us to move forward. I would urge my colleagues that when this legislation is brought for a vote that they would support it under suspension of the rules.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize Dwight D. Thomas, who retired from the Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs on June 30, 2010. A gentleman from my home County of Winston who truly embodies the American principles of hard work, patriotism, dedication to one's family and service to one's community.For the past twenty-two years and nine months, the veterans in Winston County, Alabama have had no better friend than Dwight Thomas. During that time he unselfishly served Winston County and the State of Alabama with great dedication and distinction. He worked tirelessly to ensure our veterans and their families received the benefits they had earned. His one driving goal was simply to help people.Dwight was born in my hometown of Haleyville, Alabama in 1944. He is the son of the late C. D. and Vera Thomas. He is married to the former Trudy Gravitt and has two sons, Craig and Chad. He and his wife are active members of the Haleyville First United Methodist Church.Dwight graduated from Haleyville High School in 1962 and continued his education at Walker College, receiving his Associate of Science degree in 1965. After school, he entered the United States Army and served from 1966 to 1968, serving in Vietnam from January 1967 to July 1968. He was honorably discharged in 1968 having reached the rank of Sergeant. While in the Army, he received the Army Commendation Medal, Good Conduct Medal, Meritorious Unit Citation, Vietnam Campaign Medal with ``V'' device, National Defense Service Medal and the Vietnam Service Medal.Dwight has also been active with the local Boy Scout Troop 97, serving as Scoutmaster from 1969 to 1981 and is currently the institutional representative. He has served on the Haleyville City Council for two terms from 1980 to 1988. During that period he served as liaison to the Parks and Recreation Department and the Haleyville Fire Department and was instrumental in the construction of a new fire station. Currently, Dwight is the Commander of VFW Post 4543 and has held every office in the VFW at the local and district level.Madam Speaker, it is a great privilege for me to honor Dwight D. Thomas for his many years of dedicated service to our nation's veterans. He has had an enduring impact on his country, community, friends and family. He is a man of great dignity and character who takes pride in the accomplishments of those he has helped over the years. It is clear that he has been a friend and advocate to the veterans of Winston County. Madam Speaker, no doubt Dwight will be greatly missed in his position with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Dwight is an inspiring role model for all of us and I join his friends, family and colleagues in wishing him God's richest blessings in his retirement.",

    "text": "I want to thank the gentleman for the opportunity to address the House on this important matter.Mr. Speaker, today and over the last several weeks, I think there has been a broad misunderstanding of the Interstate Recognition of Notarizations Act, which led to the President's unfortunate veto of this legislation a few weeks ago. There is absolutely no connection whatsoever between the Interstate Recognition of Notarizations Act of 2010 and the recent foreclosure documentation problems.I first introduced this legislation back in April of 2005, and obviously there was no concern about weakening the foreclosure documentation process at that time. This is a bill that would help people, and I am disappointed that the legislation has been vetoed. This legislation that I introduced would improve interstate commerce by requiring that documents be recognized in any State or Federal court. It would help court reporters; it would help attorneys, businessowners, and consumers in general.I have heard from many individuals who have been affected by this particular issue. For example, a construction company located in one State submits a contract for a job in another State and is turned down because the second State refuses to recognize the notarized contract.This is not an isolated problem. This is interfering with interstate commerce, and it should be addressed.H.R. 3808, this legislation, expressly requires lawful notarizations be recognized in other States and in no way validates improper notarizations. Let me stress that again. It in no way validates improper notarizations. Fraudulent notarizations are illegal. Enforcement of notarizations is a State responsibility, and I fully support each State Attorney General to vigorously prosecute all fraudulent notarizations.Currently, each State is responsible for regulating its notaries. Typically, someone who wishes to become a notary pays a fee. They will submit an application. They will take an oath of office. Some States require applicants to enroll in an educational course, pass an exam, or obtain a notary bond. This legislation does not change how an individual State regulates notaries in any form or fashion.This bill had strong bipartisan support in the House of Representatives each of the three times it passed the House of Representatives, and most recently, with unanimous support, as recently as April of this year. I hope the White House will work with the Congress so this legislation can eventually become law.",

On October 7, 2010, I attended such a funeral for a fallen airman who not only was my constituent, but was a family I had grown up with.I would like to pay tribute to this American Patriot from my hometown of Haleyville, Alabama, who was killed in action on September 29, 2010, in the Uruzgan Province of Afghanistan.Air Force Senior Airman Mark Andrew Forester paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our great nation. Mark was assigned to the 21st Special Tactics Squadron at Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina. He served as an Air Force Combat Controller and was embedded with a Special Forces Unit in Afghanistan.When I think of a young man like Mark, I think of words like; honor and bravery. ``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.''--John 15:13. Mark died while protecting his friends and fellow service members.In the fall of 1864, President Abraham Lincoln, wrote the following message to the mother of a fallen soldier. ``I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.'' President Lincoln's words ring more powerful today than ever before.Mark earned numerous awards during his service including a Bronze Star with Valor and a Purple Heart.It is an honor to be able to say that I was associated with Mark and his family over the years. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with Mark's family and all those who knew and loved him.",

These reforms include funding reductions, requirements for measurement, and requirements for spending languishing dollars.In total, this bill provides $1.7 billion for Homeland Security first responder grants. However, as we are all aware, not all programs are funded at the previous year's level.The consolidation in this bill requires the Secretary to examine the intelligence and risk and put scarce dollars where they are most needed, whether it is a port, rail, surveillance, or access and hardening projects--or whether it is to high-risk urban areas or to States--as opposed to reverse engineering projects to fill the amount designated for one of many programs.Additionally, as noted by the gentleman from Rhode Island, the bill limits the Urban Areas Security Initiative grants to the top 10 highest cities. Again, this puts scarce dollars where they are most needed. This does not mean lower risk cities will lose all funding; it just means the funds will come from other programs such as State Homeland grants that are risk and formula based.These cuts will not be easy, but they are long overdue and necessary to address our out-of-control Federal spending.Furthermore, the offset proposed by the gentleman is unacceptable. A reduction to the Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology account would: impact operations and maintenance on the border fence; reduce investments in critical border security communications; and affect the Border Patrol's ability to procure proven technologies to increase border security immediately.I urge my colleagues to support fiscal discipline, and I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.I yield back the balance of my time.",

However, I am going to have to reluctantly oppose the amendment.The bill that we have before us tonight strikes the right balance between funding priority programs that are essential to our Nation's security and keeping discretionary spending in check. The bill cuts nearly $3 billion, or 7 percent, from the request. That does not take into account the internal cuts taken to address the $650 million shortfall for aviation security and customs due to the phony fee offset used by the administration. It also does not reflect the significant increase provided to ensure robust funding for disaster relief.The committee has cut underperforming and ill-managed programs. We've made difficult choices on priorities for the bill. Significant cuts in this bill include $215 million from headquarters consolidation, then an additional $69 million from the Department of Management Operations, an additional $81 million from the Transportation Security Support, an additional $629 million from Science and Technology Research Development, and more than $2 billion from FEMA's First Responder Grants. Deeper cuts will serve no other purpose than endangering critical security operations from our frontline agencies, such as the Coast Guard, the Secret Service, FEMA, and TSA, that conduct daily operations to make our land secure.This past year we have seen intensified terrorist activity, including new threats to aviation, and several homegrown plots. As I have mentioned before, we have endured a near constant occurrence of natural disasters across this Nation, which require robust response capabilities and recovery investments. In light of all these challenges, the importance of the Department's work cannot be overemphasized. This is especially true as we approach the 10th anniversary of September 11.

Schaffer for his distinguished service to the Government of the United States as the Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications, National Protection and Programs Directorate, Department of Homeland Security, from May 2009 until March 2012.Mr. Schaffer is a national leader in the area of cybersecurity and communications. His unique perspective, dedication, and focus on identifying solutions to complex problems enabled the Department of Homeland Security and the Nation to take critical strides during his tenure.Mr. Schaffer brought to DHS a blend of technical knowledge, private sector understanding, and Federal prosecution experience that enriched its cybersecurity and communications efforts.Mr. Schaffer's leadership was essential in leading DHS efforts related to proposals for a Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network. With the passage of recent legislation, Mr. Schaffer's concepts and structures have the potential to result in a paradigm shift in public safety communications.During his tenure, DHS developed the National Cyber Incident Response Plan, NCIRP, the framework for incident response capabilities and coordination among Federal agencies, state and local governments, the private sector and international partners during significant cyber incidents. With the development of this plan, our Nation is postured to more effectively and comprehensively respond to the full range of cyber incidents.As Chair of the Unified Coordination Group established by the NCIRP, Mr. Schaffer led the United States Government response to a number of critical cyber incidents impacting the public and private sectors as well as international partners.Under Mr. Schaffer's leadership and direction, DHS also opened the new National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center--a 24-hour, DHS-led coordinated watch and warning and mitigation center that enhanced capabilities to address threats and incidents affecting the Nation's critical information technology and cyber infrastructure.This Center leverages the Einstein program, a set of perimeter defenses around the ``.gov'' domain designed to detect, alert, and prevent intrusions into and data loss from Federal agency networks. Because of Mr. Schaffer's leadership, Einstein 2--which provides signature-based intrusion detection technology--is currently deployed and operational at 17 of 19 Federal agencies.Mr. Schaffer also oversaw effective and diverse incident response activities across his cybersecurity and communications portfolio. In FY 2011 alone, the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team responded to more than 100,000 incident reports and released more than 5,000 actionable cybersecurity alerts and information products. The National Coordinating Center for Telecommunications and the National Communications System also led, in accordance with the National Response Framework's Emergency Support Function #2, communications response activities for the New England floods, Hurricane Irene, the 2011 Japanese Tsunami, the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, and other significant national and international disasters.Furthermore, Mr. Schaffer led activities to expand information sharing with the private sector through the Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Collaboration Program. He also supported development of tools to help private sector companies assess and improve their own network security, such as the Cyber Security Evaluation Program, CSEP, and the Cyber Security Evaluation Tool, CSET.We are grateful for his service during a consequential period at the Department, and I look forward to his continuing contributions to the security of our great Nation.",

    "title": "ENABLING ENERGY SAVING INNOVATIONS ACT",
    "text": "Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.Madam Speaker, when Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act in December 2007, it inadvertently did not allow a procedure for technologies which may provide greater energy efficiencies than even what is required in the bill. The legislation before us this afternoon simply makes a small change in relation to walk-in coolers and freezers.Section 312 of the Energy Independence and Security Act regulates the efficiency standards of walk-in coolers and freezers. The section mandates that cooler and freezer doors meet a certain R-value as a measurement of their ability to retain temperature and use less energy. The problem is that an R-value is a measurement based primarily on the thickness of foam. Therefore, requiring products to meet an R-value prohibits technologies that are just as efficient, but utilize alternative materials or technologies.These types of statutes typically provide the Department of Energy with a waiver authority. This bill simply provides the Department of Energy with the authority to waive the R-value requirement if they determine a product meets or exceeds the desired energy-efficiency goals. This bill is supported by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy. Furthermore, we have spoken with officials at the Department of Energy who recognize the need to consider the energy savings of nonfoam products.Madam Speaker, this situation offers a prime example of how making an adjustment in a government regulation can maintain standards and at the same time allow flexibility for businesses and retailers to purchase superior products to enable their businesses to use less energy and therefore save more money. The law as it currently stands is preventing this mutually beneficial transaction from taking place. Furthermore, without a waiver authority, the law will continue to limit future innovations in this important sector. It would be, as if in the 1950s, Congress had mandated that the record industry only use a certain type of vinyl. Therefore, there would be no cassette tapes, CDs, or iPods.With this simple bill, Congress can fix this oversight, allowing more eco-friendly innovations and a freer marketplace. This is one way we as Representatives can help continue to create an environment for economic growth. For those reasons, this bill enjoys wide bipartisan support, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 4850.",

The Uni-Capitol Washington Program (UCWIP) has paired some of the brightest Australian students with various congressional offices for more than a decade and I am happy to be a host again this year.Will comes from the University of Wollongong and is studying engineering and commerce. Over the past month, I have found him to be outstanding in his duties and going above and beyond our expectations. He has attended committee hearings, drafted constituent correspondence, and assisted me as well as my staff with research. His Australian accent has garnered the attention of many of my constituents on tours and over the phone. Will's commitment, hard work, and presence have been an asset to the office and he will be sorely missed by all.The program has been in force for 13 years thanks to the vision of Eric Federing, its director and founder. The students who are selected come from a variety of academic disciplines, but all have a common interest: promoting the U.S.-Australia relationship. These student placements are enhanced by the formation of genuine friendships and the exchange of views and ideas between the Australian interns and their respective offices. We are grateful for these friendships and it is our hope that they strengthen the diplomatic ties of our great countries.I would like to thank Eric Federing for the opportunity to host Will over the past several weeks. To date, over 130 interns have come through his program representing 8 different universities over the program's lifetime. It enhances opportunities for the individuals who come and enlighten those who they come to. After the internship, many receive jobs on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. or go to work with Federal or various State Parliaments in Australia. Other interns have gone on to work in the Australian Embassy or The World Bank. Simply put, this program selects incredibly talented individuals that are a pleasure to host and work with. It was an honor to have Will in our office and I wish him the very best in the future. Will, thank you again for your hard work and dedication.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to recognize the many contributions of the Alabama Trucking Association to the well-being of the State of Alabama as the Association celebrates its 75th anniversary in 2013.The Alabama Trucking Association was founded in 1938 in Birmingham and later incorporated and moved its offices to Montgomery. The Association has grown from 16 trucking companies in 1938 to over 675 trucking related firms in 2013, and has been a valuable source of information and statistics pertaining to trucking. With one of every fourteen citizens in Alabama being employed by the trucking industry, trucking provides over 106,570 jobs contributing to the economic growth and development of the State. The Alabama trucking industry pays $545 million in federal and state roadway taxes and fees representing 38% of all taxes and fees owed by Alabama motorists, despite the fact that trucks represent only 13 percent of vehicle miles traveled in the State. In addition, trucks serve all areas of Alabama and are the only transportation for goods for over eighty percent of Alabama communities and play a major role in transportation import and export movement.The Alabama Trucking Association members put safety first through improved driver training, investment in advanced safety technologies and active participation in industry safety initiatives at the local, state and national levels. The leadership of the Alabama Trucking Association has developed many friendships among Alabama's trucking companies, related industries and organizations, and members of the State Legislature and state and federal government agencies.The Alabama Trucking Association is well respected and has been very successful with its legislative and regulatory agenda, its efforts to improve highway safety, and the efficiency of trucking in Alabama.I am thankful for the Alabama Trucking Association and the service and support they provide to a vital part of Alabama and our nation's economy and work force. Congratulations to them again for 75 excellent years.",

The Franklin County Watermelon Festival began in 1981 with a group of local farmers gathering to sell their harvest of watermelons. This gathering created what is now the largest festival in Franklin County. This annual festival is organized by the Franklin County Chamber of Commerce and is sponsored by Franklin County businesses and individuals. This two day event, on the third weekend of August, is held at the Franklin County seat in the City of Russellville.Franklin County and Russellville welcome over 35,000 guests to this festival from neighboring counties and states each year.Civic clubs and organizations participate with their own special watermelon events as a time of fund raising.The Franklin County Chamber of Commerce sponsors Watermelon Contests and the Watermelon Pageant which produces a Queen for the festival. The Watermelon Queen presents awards for: best dressed melon, seed spitting, best tasting melon, most unusual melon, and of course the largest, heaviest melon.The Franklin County Watermelon Festival is made possible by volunteers who work year round to produce the best of entertainment, arts & crafts, food, activities and watermelon to please every palate.Again, it is my honor to recognize Franklin County, Alabama as the Watermelon Capital of Alabama.",

I think that needs to be stressed. It's not a handout, but it's a way to try to make investment into a region of the country that really can use some economic development encouragement, and that's exactly what this program does.As a result of ARC funding, the regional poverty rate has been cut almost in half. Infant mortality rates have been reduced, and job-creating infrastructure has provided new and improved water and sewer services to over 112,000 residents. And that's just in the last 5 years.Despite the tremendous progress that this program has made over the years, there's challenges that still exist. This region has lost roughly one-fourth of its manufacturing jobs and nearly one-fourth of Appalachia's counties still suffer from severe and persistent economic distress.Now is not the time to zero-out this effective program, especially when you're focusing on economic development. Now, more than ever, we must empower local communities and regional planning commissions to utilize this much needed Federal assistance and provide the basic building blocks for regional economic development.I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).",

    "text": "Thank you, Chairman Rogers, for giving me the opportunity to speak in support of H.J. Res. 59, which is the FY14 continuing resolution.Of course I think it's very obvious by the comments that the Republicans have made on our side this morning that we do need to keep the government open at its current sequestered funding level and continue to provide the vital services that our constituents have grown to expect from government, and certainly make sure that we don't have a government shutdown.As Chairman Rogers had mentioned, I chair the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture. Some may ask, why is it so important that we keep the government open? Can't we just go with another year-long I'd like to provide some reasons why the FY14 Ag Approps bill that passed the committee provides great benefits to the taxpayer and why we don't need to go to a year-long CR, and certainly why we don't need to do a government shutdown.In the Ag Appropriations bill, we direct the States to be in full compliance with WIC and SNAP eligibility standards, and we increase oversight of vendors to rein in the costs. We require the USDA to report on strategies that are being implemented to help weed out fraud, waste, and abuse in the SNAP program.One thing that I hear a lot about is the new school meal regulation. We want to provide more flexibility for local school districts as they implement these new school regulations for meals for the students.We require the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to develop cost-benefit analysis of several Dodd-Frank provisions that are deemed to be duplicative and also very costly.We encourage the USDA to finalize an inspection rule that has proven to decrease illness-causing pathogens in poultry operations at a reduced Federal cost. I can tell you, representing a district that grows a lot of poultry and produces a lot of poultry, that is very important.So, in closing, Madam Speaker, let me just say I fully support H. Res. 59 and ask for my colleagues to do the same.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Madam Speaker, I rise this afternoon in support of H.J. Res. 75, which would continue funding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or commonly known as the WIC program.The fiscal year 2013 Agriculture appropriations bill provided sufficient funding, even after sequestration, totaling $6.5 billion, to ensure that all participants receive both nutritious food and the nutrition services that are necessary for their health and their well-being.Before the United States Department of Agriculture completely shut down its Web site, information could be found on their Web site stating that short-term funding was available for WIC through the contingency reserve fund, carryover funds, and other available resources.While some States have indicated they have sufficient funds to at least work several more weeks, other States are not so fortunate. Many of us have seen headlines, perhaps received phone calls into our offices from constituents who have reported that their appointment at their local WIC clinic has been canceled or that clinics are being closed. Numerous times we have heard our colleagues across the aisle mention that WIC cannot continue without an appropriation for fiscal year 2014, and this will leave millions of women, infants, and children without proper nutrition.Now is a chance, Madam Speaker, for my colleagues to join us in keeping this important program fully functioning and operational. By passing the resolution that we have on the floor this afternoon, we will help 8.7 million low-income women, infants, and children who are nutritionally at risk to continue to receive the nutrition they need. This resolution will keep WIC clinics across the Nation open. No more appointments will have to be canceled.I believe that every Member of this House of Representatives believes that WIC participants need and should get the participation they need, and I would ask my colleagues to support this resolution, that we supply adequate nutrition for women, infants, and children as we move forward.I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.I want to address a couple of issues that have come up during our discussion here this afternoon.I've heard some of my colleagues across the aisle say they believe WIC has been underfunded. I do want to point out that all eligible participants are being served; and to my knowledge, no one has been turned away from the program.The FY 13 Ag approps conference agreement provided more than $7 billion for the WIC program. After sequestration and rescissions, the total equaled $6.5 billion. At the end of FY 13, WIC had carryover funds, or remaining funds, totaling nearly $300 million. Even with sequestration, WIC has been able to serve all eligible participants and still have funding left over for the end of the fiscal year by $300 million. Clearly, the program has received sufficient funding, and we have certainly made sure that to be the case.In closing today, I would hope that my colleagues would join me in support of this resolution. There's nothing cynical about what we're doing here. You can read the resolution. I have it right here. It simply continues to provide funding for the WIC program, and it provides certainty. It ensures that WIC clinics will be open, appointments will be kept, and food benefits will be provided.There's nothing, again, cynical about this. The only thing that's cynical about this is if you decide to politicize this bill.It's interesting that those who claim to be the defenders and supporters of this program are the very ones actually coming here this afternoon that are opposing the bill. My colleagues will have a chance to be cynical and vote ``no,'' but I hope they will not turn their backs on providing certainty for low-income women and children. All we want to do is to keep the program fully operational and fully funded.I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Joint Resolution 77, which would continue the funding for the Food and Drug Administration. I think everyone here in the House agrees that funding for the FDA is necessary to this critical operation in order to support our Nation's public health and the millions of jobs associated with FDA activities. Most Members of this body may not realize it, but FDA-regulated industries account for almost 25 percent of the consumer spending in the United States of America.Fiscal year 2013 ag appropriation included total funding of $4.2 billion; $2.5 billion came from discretionary funds and $1.7 billion from user fees. Of greatest importance is the need to ensure that our constituents continue to consume safe foods and use safe and effective drugs and medical devices. Despite reduced funding levels overall for FY 2013, we were able to provide a strategic increase of $12.5 million for food safety activities and $10 million for food and drug safety inspections in China. These funding increases will continue under a CR.In addition to the funds appropriated for the FDA, this resolution that we are debating this afternoon would allow FDA to collect and spend drug and medical product user fees. Of course, the fees are charged to the industry to support such lifesaving activities for the review and approval of new and generic drugs as well as medical devices.This House has already passed a resolution to fund the public health activities at the NIH, and it awaits the Senate's approval. Also, USDA meat and poultry inspectors were deemed critical to our Nation's food supply and have stayed on duty during this temporary delay in funding. It is now time for this body to continue funding one more critical component of our public health infrastructure.The Food and Drug Administration touches every Member of this House, either directly or indirectly, and we need the entire Agency back at work. We need to also limit any damage to the millions of jobs impacted by FDA's work in the food and bioscience industries.Now is the chance for my colleagues here in the House to join me in keeping this important program fully operational. I would ask that my colleagues support this resolution that we're debating this afternoon. It will ensure that all critical elements of our Nation's food and drug supply will be protected.I reserve the balance of my time.",

Until the White House and the Senate are willing to sit down and negotiate a quick solution to this stalemate, I ask that my friends across the aisle join me in supporting the Food and Drug Administration, an agency that is on the front lines for our public health on a day-to-day basis.There are a number of us who would question why nearly half of the FDA is furloughed when nearly all of their work impacts the safety and protection of human life. However, the administration has chosen to cease activities related to food, to medical devices, and to human drug establishment inspections, infant formula notifications, and to laboratory research that are tied to public health decision-making.Most importantly, I would want to think that the administration is not playing politics with the safety of our Nation's food supply; but why is it that 87 percent of the Food Safety and Inspection Service is on the job while only about half of FDA's food safety staff are actually working, especially when FDA is responsible for 80 percent of the food supply?As I noted in my opening remarks a few minutes ago, I would speculate that many of our colleagues don't realize how the FDA impacts every single one of our constituents in one way or the other. From formula fed to babies, to blood transfusions needed during emergencies and routine surgeries, to drugs that extend the lives of the sick, to the domestic or imported foods we feed to our families, on every occasion, the FDA is there.Just 2 days ago, this body voted 407-0 to approve a measure that will provide backpay to furloughed Federal workers. This vote did not impact the critical needs of public health, yet an important vote, nonetheless. I would ask that each of the 407 Members who voted on Saturday for the backpay for Federal workers to now vote in favor of a bill that provides for urgent needs for our public safety and our welfare across the United States of America.Again, I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.I am pleased to begin consideration of H.R. 4800, making appropriations for FY 2015 for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies. The bill before us is unique in that the programs supported in this bill will impact every American every day of the year.We support America's farmers and ranchers, who are very vital to our Nation's economy and our health and well-being. We support those at home in need with food and housing and provide rural businesses with low-interest loans and grants to help them sustain local economies. We help others around the world that face starvation and malnutrition. We support research and development in agriculture to improve productivity and stability. We support the oversight of commodity markets, providing confidence for businesses, traders, investors, and the public. We support a safe food supply and safe and effective drugs and devices. We are fortunate this Nation can and does support these vital programs.The bill before us this afternoon reflects a delicate balance of needs and requirements. We have drafted what I consider a responsible bill for FY 2015 spending levels for the departments and agencies that are under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee. We have had to carefully prioritize the funding in this bill. We have had to make some hard choices about how to limit spending.I want to thank the gentleman from Kentucky, Chairman Rogers, for supporting us with a very fair allocation for this bill and for helping us move this bill forward.I also want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Farr), the subcommittee ranking member. He has been a valuable partner and colleague as we have moved forward with this legislation. I appreciate his commitment. I appreciate his understanding as we have moved forward on a wide variety of programs in this bill, and I sincerely thank him for his help. While I and the other subcommittee members have a wide array of agriculture in our districts, Mr. Farr represents an area sometimes referred to as the ``salad bowl of the world.'' I want to thank all of the members of the subcommittee for their help, and I also thank the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), who is the ranking member for the full committee.I also thank the majority staff for their hard work: Tom O'Brien, Betsy Bina, Pam Miller, Andrew Cooper, and Karen Ratzow.I also appreciate the professionalism and the cooperation of the minority staff. In particular, I want to thank Martha Foley and Hogan Medlin for their help during all of the long hours spent putting this bill and report together, as well as Rochelle Dornatt, Troy Phillips, and Caitie Whelan of Mr. Farr's staff.When the subcommittee began the FY15 appropriations process, I asked my colleagues to keep in mind three guiding principles. They were: to ensure the proper use of funds through robust oversight, ensuring the appropriate level of regulation to protect producers and the public, and to ensure funding is targeted to vital programs.These three principles guided us from the time the President's budget request was first submitted to the subcommittee until this bill was put before the House today. This basic framework helped us set principles and priorities during the 10 budget hearings and oversight hearings that we had throughout the spring, which covered all of USDA's mission area, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, and also included the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.They also formed a framework for us to consider the many requests we received from our colleagues on this bill. In particular, we received more than 3,900 requests from 326 Members to support, reduce, or amend funding levels in the numerous accounts of this bill. Of course we could not meet every request, but we tried to address these requests in a bipartisan manner and in a way that was under the House rules. As such, there are no earmarks included in this bill.The total funding for this bill is $142.5 billion. This is $1.5 billion below the President's request and $3 billion below the FY14-enacted level. The bill includes $20.88 billion in discretionary budget authority, which is the same as the FY14-enacted level. Mandatory spending totals $122 billion, or $3 billion below the FY14 level. These mandatory funds support USDA's farm, conservation, crop insurance, and nutrition programs.I would like to briefly mention a few highlights that are in this bill.We provide $2.8 billion for agricultural research. We have received many, many letters requesting support for the land-grant colleges and universities. We were able to provide level funding for them. We also provided $325 million, as requested, for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative, which is USDA's premier competitive research grants program.We provide $870 million for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. This agency works to eradicate plant and animal diseases and keeps the bad bugs out of the country. I am pleased to say that we were able to increase funding to combat citrus greening disease and the viral epidemic affecting the hog producers. This funding will supplement the emergency funding that the administration announced last week for research and surveillance purposes.The bill also includes more than $1 billion for the Food Safety and Inspection Service. This is approximately the same as the FY14 level, but $3.8 million above the request. It will maintain more than 8,000 inspectors at more than 6,400 meat, poultry, and egg product facilities across the Nation.The bill provides $1.5 billion for the Farm Service Agency, and it does not allow the closure of any county offices. This proposal made no sense when the 2014 farm bill is still being implemented in county offices across the Nation. We also fully fund the various farm loan programs in this bill.For the Natural Resources Conservation Service, we provide $869 million to help farmers, ranchers, and private forest land owners conserve and protect their land and increase funding to help rehabilitate small dams.This bill is the only one of the 12 appropriations bills that truly focuses on rural America. It provides $2.6 billion for the rural development programs. That includes funding to support $881 million in business and industry loans, $1.3 billion in loans for rural water and waste programs, and $6.2 billion for rural electric and telephone infrastructure. We also provide more than $1 billion for the single-family direct loan program, $1.1 billion for rental assistance, and $30 million for the Mutual and Self-Help program.This bill includes both discretionary and mandatory funding for USDA's food and nutrition programs.In particular, it provides $6.6 billion for the Women, Infants, and Children program. This is $93 million below the FY14 enacted level, and it is actually $200 million below the budget request. But I want to be clear about the decreased funding because a declining caseload and large carryover balances from the previous year is why we are doing this. And let me stress that every person who is eligible for the program will be able to receive funding under this funding level in this bill.The bill includes $20.5 billion in required mandatory funding for child nutrition programs and $82.3 billion for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, sometimes referred to as SNAP. This funding level helps support more than 47 million Americans each month.To support those in time of need in places like Syria, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic, the bill provides $1.7 billion for overseas food aid. We were able to provide a $66 million increase for Food for Peace grants, and $13 million for the McGovern-Dole Education and Child Nutrition Program offset from savings that we found elsewhere in the bill.The Food and Drug Administration receives $2.6 billion in discretionary funding in this bill. This is an increase of $23 million over the FY14 level. When the user fees are included, FDA will receive $4.5 billion in FY15.Within the total, the committee provides a $25 million increase of the full amount requested for food safety activities in the President's budget, and drug safety activities are increased by $12 million.Furthermore, the bill includes $218 million for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This is an increase of $3 million above last year's level and is intended to address information technology needs.Before I close, I do want to address one issue that has opened up a necessary dialogue in local cafeterias and schools across the Nation. It is the provision that would allow schools to seek a temporary--and let me stress that it is a temporary--waiver from the current school lunch standards if a school district has lost money over the last 6-month period as a result of trying to implement the new regulations.I have had a constant stream of letters, I have talked to people, received emails, and I have had meetings over the past year with school nutritionists, with the teachers, and the school administrators. I have talked to parents, and I have talked to students, all concerned about the rising cost, the increased waste, and the declining participation in the school lunch program.To tell the truth, the students have been concerned about the taste, they have been concerned about the variety and the quality of the meals. But, again, we have gone to the school nutritionists, to the teachers, and the administrators who have identified where the real problem is.This is a real problem in many school districts across the country. Some school districts may not be experiencing this problem, but many, many are across the country. This bill acknowledges the concerns of schools and responds to their requests for a certain amount of flexibility. It only allows schools more time if they need it. In fact, it provides something very similar to the flexibility that USDA recently announced for the whole grain requirements.The benefits to farmers, ranchers, consumers, businesses, and patients provided in this bill far outweigh any one or two objections a Member may have about this bill. The bill represents our best take on matching needs with limited resources. We have tried to work hard to produce the best bill we possibly can within the resources that we have had to work with in this appropriations process.I thank the Members for their attention, and I would urge all the Members to support this bipartisan legislation. I look forward to passing this bill on the floor as we move forward, and I reserve the balance of my time. ",

    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a very dear friend and pioneer Hawaii businessman, Hung Wo Ching, Aloha Airgroup vice chairman, who died on March 26, 1996, in Honolulu. Since 1958, Mr. Ching served on the interisland carrier's board of directors and held a number of executive positions with the company. Under his leadership, Aloha Airlines Inc. grew from an upstart airline to become the dominant interisland carrier in the State of Hawaii.Hung Wo Ching was raised in Hawaii by immigrant parents from Canton, China. He graduated from Honolulu's McKinley High School in 1931 and attended the University of Hawaii. Following his freshman year, he studied liberal arts at Yenching University in Beijing, China.In 1935, he returned to the United States and completed his undergraduate education at Utah State University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in agricultural economics. In 1945, he received his doctorate in agricultural economics from Cornell University. When he was 41 years old, he attended Harvard University as a visiting scholar.In 1945, Mr. Ching traveled to Tientsin, China to start a sugarbeet industry. The outbreak of civil war in China 2 years later put an end to those dreams, and he returned to Hawaii to concentrate on his real estate investments. Shortly after his return to Hawaii, the founder of Trans Pacific Airlines encouraged him to invest in his upstart airline.In addition to being on Aloha's board of directors, Mr. Ching was also a director for Bishop Insurance of Hawaii, Inc., and the chairman of the board of directors of Diamond Head Memorial Park and Nuuanu Memorial Park. He was an honorary trustee of the U.S. Committee for Economic Development and the Bishop Museum, and a member of the advisory councils of Cornell University and Utah State University. He was a member of the Judicial Council of the Supreme Court of Hawaii, the Hawaiian Civic Club, and the advisory board of Liliuokalani Trust.Over the years, Mr. Ching has held trusteeships and directorships with many Hawaii companies and charitable foundations, including Bishop Estate, Bank of Hawaii, Alexander and Baldwin, Matson Navigation Co., Hawaiian Telephone, Hawaiian Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Hawaiian Western Steel, Ltd., and Hauoli Sales, Ltd.Mr. President, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in paying tribute to the memory of Hung Wo Ching, and pass along our deepest sympathies to his wife, Elizabeth, and his children and grandchildren.

    "title": "RACE FOR THE CURE",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise with others of my colleagues in the Senate in support of the sixth annual National Race for the Cure, which will be held in Washington, DC, on Saturday, June 15, this year.Race for the Cure, as has been noted, is a breast cancer benefit run sponsored by the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. The foundation was established in 1982 by Nancy Brinker in honor of her sister who died of breast cancer at the age of 36.Since its creation, the foundation, through events such as Race for the Cure, has raised millions of dollars to promote education, promote awareness, promote research, and promote early detection of the disease.Three-fourths of the money raised goes toward local treatment and screening activities, while one-fourth of the funds goes to the Komen Foundation to fund national research activities.The statistics on breast cancer remain startling, Mr. President. This year, an estimated 44,000 women in our country will die from breast cancer, and another 184,000 will be diagnosed with the disease. I continue to have great concern over the high incidence and low survival rates for this disease among minority and low-income women. I remain particularly concerned that the Native Hawaiian women have the highest incidence of breast cancer among all racial and ethnic groups in this country.While the cause of breast cancer remains unknown and the disease is not fully understood, significant advancements have been made in the management of breast cancer. As with many of the life-threatening illnesses, early detection of breast cancer, coupled with appropriate and timely followup, remains the most effective method to ensure successful treatment and improved survivability. However, Mr. President, much work remains. Many women do not know how to conduct self-examinations, and many would benefit from a screening mammogram. Some of them do not seek it because of fear, because of cost or even because of lack of access.In closing, Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues and their staff and families to participate in the 1996 National Race for the Cure. All of us have families or friends who have battled breast cancer.In particular, this sixth annual race has special meaning for those of us in the Senate. This year's race is dedicated to the memory of Martha Moloney, a longtime aide to Senator Wendell Ford who lost her valiant fight against breast cancer last November.Continuing the fight against breast cancer is the most appropriate way to honor Martha's memory and to recognize the heroic efforts of millions of women and their families confronting this disease.Mr. President, this is one of those dreaded diseases in our country. We all need to support the race 100 percent and participate in all of these activities.Thank you very much, Mr. President.Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.",

    "title": "RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGIES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT",
    "text": "Mr. President, I want to express my support of Jeffords-Roth-Leahy renewable energy amendment. This amendment will restore funding for the Department of Energy solar and renewable energy research and development program to the amount appropriated in fiscal year 1996.I want to thank Senator Jeffords for offering this amendment because I believe that our country's renewable energy program is at an important watershed. With support from Congress and the Federal Government, our Nation can forge ahead in developing reliable and cost-effective renewable technologies. We can also position our renewable energy industry to capture its share of the rapidly expanding market of solar and other renewable technologies. And, we can expand power generation capacity in an environmentally responsible manner.In recent years, energy efficiency and renewable energy programs have been remarkably successful and have created a new industry capable of world leadership in a very important technology sector. Energy efficient technologies are generating billions of dollars of consumer energy savings and new business opportunities and play an important role in job creation, according to a study by energy expert Daniel Yergin. If we retreat from this promising growth industry, as we did throughout the decade of 1980s, our international competitors will quickly carve up a market that will exceed a billion dollars by the turn of the century. We should not reduce funding for renewable R&amp;D and allow this initiative to sputter and stall. We must move forward, as other countries are doing, and make essential investments in technologies that will create new jobs, open export markets, and promote a healthy environment. This is the choice we have made in approving this amendment.At stake is our ability to compete in an international energy market that will experience explosive growth in the decades ahead. Many countries cannot afford to meet the growing energy demand by building, operating, and maintaining centralized power plants and the costly infrastructure associated with them. The flexibility offered by renewable technologies is a natural fit for the developing world.Countries around the world are also making conscious strategic decisions to endorse and adopt renewable energy as a mainstay of their energy policy. These policies may lead to the amelioration of problems associated with global climate change.The past decade was a period of unparalleled success in the drive to reduce the cost of solar and renewable technologies. Some are at the verge of becoming cost competitive with conventional energy sources. This trend will continue to improve in the years ahead. As these technologies become more and more cost competitive, the rate at which these technologies are integrated into the energy grid will steadily increase.What is at stake is the ability of a young, dynamic industry to capture the world markets for renewable technologies so that Americans can hold their share of rewarding, high paying jobs. That is what the Jeffords amendment is all about. If we are to move into the future with a strong economy and a healthy environment, renewable energy technologies must be a part of our investment strategy for the future.Although the value of U.S. renewable energy exports exceeds a quarter of a billion dollars, the U.S. renewable energy industry is barely penetrating the expanding world market for renewable energy technologies. This is a result of a weak commitment to renewable energy research, development, and export promotion.Compared with seven other leading trading nations, the United States ranks lowest in resources allocated to solar and renewable export promotion, according to a 1992 Department of Energy report.National Science Foundation data confirms that the U.S. investment in R&amp;D is in decline. Since 1987, Federal R&amp;D investments have dropped steadily in real terms. Since 1992, industry R&amp;D has stagnated. And today, less than one-third of private R&amp;D is dedicated to research; the rest is being spent on product and process development.I support the Jeffords amendment because I want to reverse this trend. Frankly, I would have preferred higher spending levels for solar and renewable programs, but this is not realistic given the budget constraints we face. Unless we maintain a reasonable funding level for these programs, we will continue to lose ground and should not be surprised if other countries outcompete U.S. industry in this rapidly expanding market.Finally, there are important energy security reasons for supporting this amendment. U.S. oil imports are at record levels, are continuing to grow, and could reach 60 percent of consumption by the year 2005. Oil imports that high would contribute nearly $90 billion to the trade deficit. According to a recent Department of Commerce analysis, this level of oil imports constitutes a threat to U.S. economic security. Persian Gulf countries are projected to control 70 percent of the global market for oil by the year 2010, making world oil markets increasingly unstable.Renewable energy technologies will lead to significant movement toward alleviating some of the potential negative consequences of our continuing and increasing reliance on imported oil.

    "title": "S. 1711, VETERANS' BENEFITS IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 1996",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1711, the Veterans' Benefits Improvements Act of 1996. I am especially pleased that this measure includes provisions that would improve the Centers for Minority and Women Veterans and allow refinancing under the Veterans' Home Loan Program Amendments of 1992. These provisions are based on measures I introduced earlier in this Congress which were reported by the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.Mr. President, S. 1711 contains a provision that authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to refinance direct loans issued to Native American veterans under Native American Home Loan Program, established by Public Law 102-547. This initiative is derived from S. 1342, legislation I introduced with Senators Rockefeller, Inouye, Wellstone, and Simon. Under this provision, the same credit standards that apply to refinancing of VA guaranteed loans also apply to refinancing of Native American direct loans.As my colleagues are aware, the Native American Direct Loan Pilot Program was established by Congress to ensure equal access to home loans for those veterans residing on reservations or other trust lands. Because trust lands cannot be used as collateral, commercial lending institutions are unwilling to issue mortgages for housing on such lands. The direct loans authorized under Public Law 102-547 permit Native Americans to purchase, construct, or improve dwellings on trust land despite the absence of commercial financing.As of May 1996, VA had entered into agreements with 38 tribes and Native Hawaiians to provide direct home loans to tribal members, and negotiations were ongoing to conclude agreements with 21 additional tribes. More than 90 loans had been closed, 42 commitments issued, and 130 applications pending.Recently, however, VA determined that Native Americans wishing to take advantage of lower interest rates could not refinance under the program. This clearly violated the intent of Congress in establishing the program, which was to ensure that Native American veterans enjoy the same access to VA home loan benefits as other veterans, especially when one considers the fact that refinancing is authorized under other VA loan programs.This bill will correct this inequity and, hopefully, encourage other Native Americans to utilize the direct loan program.It is important to point out that VA will not incur additional costs if this refinancing option is adopted, since the agency will be permitted to charge an administrative refinancing fee. In fact, it is possible that the refinancing provision will save the department money as well, by allowing veterans to lower their mortgage payments and thus reduce the likelihood of default.Mr. President, S. 1711 also contains improvements to the Centers for Minority and Women Veterans as well as the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans that were enacted as part of Public Law 103-446. These provision are derived from S. 749, legislation I introduced with Senator Rockefeller last year.Among other initiatives, Public Law 103-446 established within VA a Center for Minority Veterans, a Center for Women Veterans, and an Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans. These provisions were adopted in order to ensure that VA appropriately addresses the special needs and concerns of veterans who are women or members of minority groups. S. 1711 makes the following modifications to these initiatives:First, it allows the directors of the Center for Minority Veterans and the Center for Women Veterans to have either career or noncareer status. Under the legislation adopted 2 years ago, both directors are required to be noncareer appointees. I believe the Secretary should have the discretion to appoint either career or noncareer individuals to these jobs. This bill restores that option so that the Secretary will have the flexibility to appoint directors with career status so as to be able to consider the widest possible field of qualified candidates.Second, it adds an additional function to the list of statutory functions of the Center for Minority Veterans. Specifically, the legislation requires the center to advise the Secretary of the effectiveness of VA's efforts to include minority groups in clinical research and on the particular health conditions affecting the health of minority group members. This provision is consistent with the goals set forth in section 492B of the Public Health Service Act. The Center for Women Veterans is already mandated by law to carry out a similar function with respect to the health of women veterans.Third, it explicitly requires that the Center for Minority Veterans provides support and administrative services to the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans. This provision is consistent with the traditional agency role of providing professional and technical support to advisory entities. Again, this provision parallels existing law requiring that the Center for Women Veterans provide support to the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans.Fourth, it defines the minority veterans for whom the Center for Minority Veterans has responsibility. The law establishing the Center neglected to provide such a definition. This bill defines minority veterans as individuals who are Asian American, Black, Hispanic, Native American--including American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian--and Pacific-Islander American. This definition is identical to the definition included in current law with respect to the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans.Fifth, the legislation extends the termination date of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans an additional 2 years, from December 31, 1997, to December 31, 1999. This provision is necessary because delays in establishing the Advisory Committee have reduced its potential working life to significantly less than the three years authorized by Congress. Extending the life of the Advisory Committee to December 1999 is not unreasonable, given that all other statutory VA advisory boards, including the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans, the Advisory Committee on Former Prisoners of War, and the Advisory Committee on Prosthetics and Special-Disabilities Programs, are authorized permanently. In fact, I hope that Congress will in the future consider an initiative to authorize the Advisory Committee on a permanent basis.Finally, S. 1711 contains a provision that gives the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans and the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans responsibility for monitoring and evaluating the respective activities of the Center for Minority Veterans and the Center for Women Veterans. Insofar as the Advisory Committees were established to oversee all of the activities of the Department of Veterans Affairs with respect to minorities and women, they necessarily should be tasked with overseeing the work of the very offices that are chiefly responsible for ensuring that the special needs of minority and female veterans are accommodated by VA.Mr. President, I am deeply grateful to Senator Simpson and Senator Rockefeller for including the home loan and minority provisions in the pending measure. I also wish to thank their respective Committee staffs, including Bill Tuerk and Tom Harvey for the majority and Bill Brew and Jim Gottlieb for the minority, for working so hard on a bipartisan basis to help me develop and refine these initiatives. Together, our efforts will significantly improve access by minority and women veterans to VA benefits and services.Thank you, Mr. President. I urge swift passage of this important measure. ",

    "text": "Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3118, the Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, as amended by the committee substitute. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the substitute amendment, which provides for greater uniformity and flexibility in veterans' health care eligibility, enacts significant improvements in health care programs, and authorizes major construction projects.I am especially pleased with sections of the bill that make improvements in the Readjustment Counseling Service [RCS] program. As my colleagues know, RCS operates over 200 community-based vet centers around the Nation, each of which provides a variety of services designed to help returned veterans adjust to civilian life. These include services relating to post-traumatic stress disorder, homelessness, disaster assistance, sexual trauma, alcohol and substance abuse, suicide prevention, the physically disabled, and minority veterans. To date, vet centers have successfully assisted well over 1 million veterans.The RCS improvements in this bill include: making World War II and Korea theater veterans eligible for vet center services for the first time; directing VA to study the desirability of collocating vet centers with outpatient clinics; directing VA to report on the feasibility of providing limited, primary health care services at vet centers; making the Advisory Committee on Readjustment of Veterans a permanent, statutory entity; and clarifying and enhancing the status of the Director of RCS, which will guarantee a degree of administrative autonomy for the program.Mr. President, these provision are derived from S. 403, the Readjustment Counseling Service Amendments of 1995, which was cosponsored by Senators Daschle, Wellstone, Inouye, and Jeffords. S. 403 in turn was derived from legislation I originally offered in the 103d Congress which twice passed the Senate. I am disappointed that some of the provision of S. 403 were not included in this compromise measure. These include provisions that would have: made RCS a statutory agency within VA, required congressional notification of proposed changes to the administrative or organizational structure of RCS, required a specific RCS operating budget to be identified in VA's annual budget submission, and authorized vet centers to offer bereavement counseling to the families of service persons killed in service. Nevertheless, I am deeply appreciative that many of the goals of that legislation have been achieved in the pending measure.Mr. President, many people deserve to be recognized for their efforts in making possible the RCS provisions in this bill. First, I would like to thank Senators Simpson and Rockefeller and their respective staffs, notably Chris Yoder and Bill Brew, for putting together this compromise.Second, I wish to recognize Al Batres, Susan Angell, Stephen Molnar, and other RCS employees, whose testimony before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee in 1993 provided the original justification for my legislation. Steve Molnar, Director of the Honolulu Vet Center, has been, and continues to be, a source of inspiration for his untiring dedication to the Aloha State's veterans.Last, I wish to acknowledge the contributions of Gerry Kifer, a former Congressional Fellow with my office, whose insights and hard work led to the drafting of my original RCS legislation. Gerry provided the focus and energy that made today's legislation possible.Thank you, Mr. President. I hope my colleagues can support the RCS provisions contained in H.R. 3118, as amended. I urge swift enactment of the bill. ",

    "title": "A MORE BALANCED IMMIGRATION BILL",
    "text": "Mr. President, as we move toward adjournment, I wish to comment on the recently passed illegal immigration reform bill. I also wish to commend everyone who helped hammer out the compromise that was incorporated into H.R. 4278, the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations bill.The resulting compromise properly shifted the focus from penalizing those legally admitted to this country to those who illegally cross our borders. The conference report, as passed by the House of Representatives last week, would have severely restricted benefit eligibility for legal permanent residents and other lawfully admitted immigrants. Legal residents--people who contribute to our society by working hard, paying taxes, serving in our Nation's Armed Forces, and observing all laws to remain in the United States--would have been ineligible for most Federally funded public assistance based on income.The resulting compromise eliminates deeming provisions that would have restricted the ability of legal immigrants to receive federal benefits during their first 5 years in the United States. Moreover, it dropped provisions mandating deportation or denial of naturalized status to immigrants who accept Federal benefits during a 12-month period over 7 years.These are significant changes which soften the newly enacted welfare reform bill that bars legal resident aliens from receiving a number of Federal benefits.The House-passed conference agreement also called for establishing income standards for the sponsorship by U.S. citizens of family members that were unrealistically high and would have had a deleterious effect on family reunification--a long-standing goal of U.S. immigration policy. The conference agreement numbers would have kept sponsorship of immediate family members out of the reach of many hard-working, tax-paying families. Under the compromise, sponsors of immigrant relatives must now earn a minimum of 125 percent of the Federal poverty level. This is a more realistic standard that will assist low-income wage earners in reuniting with their family members.I voted for the Senate immigration reform bill in May, not because I thought it was perfect, but because it addressed the issue of illegal immigration. I was hopeful that the House and Senate bills could be negotiated in a bipartisan fashion so that Congress could enact meaningful immigration reform. During the conference, Democrats were excluded from the process. The results, Mr. President, were predictable.The Congress does not represent only one opinion. We must be willing and able to compromise, to hear one another's concerns, and find solutions that will not harm our citizens and legal immigrants. Congress was on the verge of enacting legislation that would have created a second-class citizenship for legal immigrants. I am pleased that we were able to avert action that would have unfairly treated those legally admitted to this country, threatened to close the door on refugees fleeing persecution, and denied working Americans the right to be reunited with their families.

    "title": "FRANCE'S CESSATION OF NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC",
    "text": "Mr. President, it is with a great sense of relief and hope that I rise today to comment on the announcement by French President Jacques Chirac that France has concluded its nuclear weapons testing program for good and will close its nuclear testing center in French Polynesia. Like most people throughout the Pacific islands and Asia, the citizens of Hawaii were angered by the six underground nuclear explosions at Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls conducted by France. The threat to the environment and public health posed by the numerous blasts over the years is real and ongoing. This week, an article in the Washington Post documented French acknowledgement that radioactive materials have leaked into the sea surrounding the atolls. These reports confirm claims made by international organizations that French nuclear testing has weakened the coral atolls and vented radioactive materials into the Pacific. Regrettably, France has not allowed independent inquiry and verification at the test sites.The global outcry against the resumption of French nuclear testing has given renewed vigor to the drive for an international moratorium on nuclear testing and the completion of a comprehensive test ban treaty. International protests extended well beyond the nations of the Pacific; the French action drew criticism in the United States and objections from most members of the European Union. The Senate and the Congress joined the international chorus of concern following President Chirac's announcement last summer that France would end its testing moratorium. Last session, the Congress adopted a sense of the Senate resolution I authored calling on France and China to abide by the international moratorium on nuclear test explosions and refrain from conducting underground nuclear tests in advance of a comprehensive test ban treaty.Mr. President, the definitive end to nuclear testing by France is welcome news. It comes after six unnecessary and ill-advised nuclear explosions. However, France's rejoining the global moratorium, pledge to sign the Treaty of Rarotonga, and commitment to pursue a zero-option test ban treaty presents an opportunity to conclude a permanent nuclear test ban treaty and advance nuclear nonproliferation. The challenge we face is to reach agreement among the nations participating in the United Nations Conference on Disarmament. In his State of the Union message, President Clinton called for the signing of a truly comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty this year. This ambitious timetable underlines the President's strong leadership in the effort to halt the nuclear arms race, advance nuclear disarmament, and ensure peace and security for all people.President Chirac's intention to play an active role in concluding an international nuclear testing ban should add momentum to efforts now underway in Geneva, Switzerland aimed at resolving remaining disagreements over the text of the treaty. We should encourage all positive contributions toward nuclear disarmament, even those that come from recent converts to the cause.Mr. President, the state visit and address to Congress by the President of the Republic of France has prompted denunciations and calls for action by many citizens and elected officials. This understandable reaction reflects the anger, pain, and offense felt by the people of the Pacific islands over the arrogance and insensitivity with which their objections have been dismissed. This singular opportunity offers President Chirac a forum to embark on a new course to advance nuclear nonproliferation. I encourage President Chirac to pursue reconciliation with the Pacific island peoples and nations. France should not delay its pledge to sign the protocols of the Treaty of Rarotonga, which declare and establish the South Pacific as a nuclear-free zone. I also call on President Chirac to permit independent inspection and evaluation of the test sites and the lagoon and sea surrounding the atolls for environmental damage and radiation leakage.The political and environmental damage wrought by the recently concluded tests cannot be undone. However, the end of the final series of underground nuclear testing by France offers an opportunity and challenge for our countries to cooperate on the successful conclusion and approval of a comprehensive test ban treaty this year. It is with this spirit of hope that I greet the state visit by the President of the Republic of France.Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "text": "Mr. President, in behalf of myself, Senator Frist, and Senator Inouye, I am today introducing the National Parks Airspace Management Act of 1997, a bill designed to mitigate the impact of commercial air tour flights over units of the National Park System. The measure would establish a new, statutory framework for minimizing the environmental effects of air tour activity on park units. This measure is similar to legislation I offered in the last two Congresses.Briefly, our bill would specify the respective authorities of the National Park Service and the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] in developing and enforcing park overflight policy; establish a process for developing individualized airspace management plans at parks experiencing significant commercial air tour activity; provide for the designation of those parks which did not experience commercial air tour activity as of January 1, 1997, as flight-free parks; establish a new, single standard governing the certification and operation of all commercial air tour operators that conduct flights over national parks; require a variety of safety measures, such as improved aircraft markings, maintenance of accurate aeronautical charts, installation of flight monitoring equipment, and an air tour data base; and, establish a National Park Overflight Advisory Council. Mr. President, aircraft overflights of noise-sensitive areas such as national parks have been increasing in scope and intensity for a number of years, sparking significant public debate and controversy about the safety and environmental impact of such activity. The focus of much of the debate, and much of the controversy, has been the commercial air tour sightseeing industry, which has experienced explosive growth in some areas, notably at the Grand Canyon and in my own State of Hawaii. But significant commercial air tour activity has also been developing in such widely dispersed locations as Glacier National Park in Montana, the Utah national parks, Mount Rushmore in South Dakota, and the Statue of Liberty and Niagara Falls in New York. In fact, at Great Smoky Mountains National Park, commercial air tour overflights have fostered such opposition that the State of Tennessee has passed legislation to restrict such flights.In 1987, precipitated by a midair collision at the Grand Canyon, Congress adopted the National Parks Overflights Act, Public Law 100-91. The act permanently banned below-the-rim flights at the Grand Canyon and led to a Special Federal Aviation Regulation--SFAR 50-2--establishing flight-free zones and air corridors at the park. The act also established temporary altitude restrictions for Yosemite National Park in California and Haleakala National Park in Hawaii. Finally, Public Law 100-91 mandated that the Park Service conduct a study on the impact of low-level flights on units of the National Park System.Since passage of the National Parks Overflights Act, a number of important developments have occurred. First, in 1993 a Department of Transportation and Department of the Interior interagency working group was established to address park overflight issues of mutual concern, an acknowledgment by the executive branch that the issue required extensive interagency cooperation, but also a reflection of the deep differences in approach and attitude that existed between the National Park Service and the FAA on this contentious matter.In 1994, the overflights report mandated by Public Law 100-91 was completed, identifying and documenting low-altitude flights as threats to park resources and recommending a variety of means to address these threats, such as incentives to encourage use of quite aircraft technology, flight-free zones and flight corridors, altitude restrictions, noise budgets, and limits on times of air tour operations. Also in 1994, in response to a pair of helicopter crashes in the Pacific, the FAA issued an emergency flight rule--SFAR 71--imposing certain altitude and other operating restrictions on air tour operators in Hawaii.More recently, last spring, the President issued an executive memorandum directing agency heads to participate in the effort to protect natural quite in National Park System units. The memorandum led to the final rule for the Grand Canyon, issued in December 1996, providing for additional, delineated restrictions on air tour activity at the park. The memorandum also led to a new rule promulgated earlier this year to ban preemptively, for 2 years or until a national rule is developed, flights at Rocky Mountain National Park. Finally, as a result of the President's memorandum, the FAA and the Park Service were required to develop a comprehensive, national rule governing air tour flights at all national parks. Work on the national rule is in the preliminary stages.While these developments have been welcome, it is fair to say that overall progress on the overflights issue has been desultory. For every Grand Canyon or Rocky Mountain, there are dozens of parks whose overflights problems remain completely unaddressed. In this regard, problems and delays associated with the development of a national rule have been particularly disappointing. Reportedly, the FAA and Park Service continue to squabble over matters of jurisdiction, and air tour operators and environmental organizations continue to prefer confrontation to accommodation. In the meantime, air tour-generated problems continue to accrete, exacerbating the environmental and safety consequences of park overflights. This experience has shown us that only Congress, through legislation, can produce lasting, effective policy on this matter.Mr. President, when all is said and done, the simple truth is that the complex problems associated with park overflights cannot be fully resolved administratively. In my opinion, this state of affairs is largely due to the fact that the FAA and the Park Service, the two agencies with the heaviest responsibility for addressing park overflights, are governed by vastly different statutory mandates. On the one hand, the FAA is responsible for the safety and efficiency of air commerce; on the other, the Park Service is charged with protecting and preserving park resources. These mutually exclusive missions have bred different approaches, attitudes, and institutional cultures that have hindered interagency cooperation and development of a consistent, effective park overflights policy. Only by modifying or clarifying their statutory responsibilities with respect to the management of park airspace can the two Federal agencies be expected to work together consistently and systematically to address the overflight problem.Mr. President, the legislation we are proposing today would address this and other barriers to the development of a comprehensive park overflights policy. Our bill deals with the commercial air tour overflights issue in a national context, since the safety and environmental concerns which are being debated so vociferously at the Grand Canyon and in Hawaii are being echoed at park units scattered throughout the National Park System.At the outset, our bill establishes a finding that National Park Service policy recognizes the importance of natural quiet as a resource to be conserved and protected in certain park units. Toward that end, our legislation creates a new statutory framework for minimizing the environmental effects of air tour activity on units throughout the National Park System.The bill articulates a regulatory scheme under which the Park Service and the FAA are required to work in tandem to develop operational policies with respect to the overflights problem. It provides for joint administration in many areas while clearly denoting the FAA's primary on matters related to safety and air efficiency and the Park Service's lead role in identifying the resources to be protected and the best means of protecting them.The bill requires the development, with public involvement, of individually tailored park airspace management plans for units significantly affected by overflight activity, as determined by the Director of the Park Service. It calls for good faith negotiations between commercial air tour operators and both the Park Service and the FAA to reach agreement on flights over park areas.It provides for the Park Service to recommend to the FAA the designation of individual units as ``flight-free parks'' for those units which, as of January 1, 1997, experienced no overflights by commercial air tour operators and where air tour flights would be incompatible with or injurious to the purposes or values of those parks.It also mandates the development by the FAA of a generic operational rule for commercial air tour operations at all units of the National Park System, subject to modification at individual park units based on negotiations among air tour operators, the FAA, and the Park Service.Our legislation requires the FAA to implement a single standard, through a new subpart of part 135, title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, for certifying commercial air tour operators. Such a uniform standard, which has been recommended by the National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB], will substantially enhance safety by providing essential consistency in such areas as pilot qualifications, training, and flight and duty time limitations.It mandates commercial air tour safety initiatives recommended by the NTSB and others, including the installation of a flight monitoring system and the use of identification markings unique to a commercial air tour operator, the development of aeronautical charts which reflect airspace management provisions with respect to individual park units, and the development of a national database on air tour operations.Last, but by no means least, the bill establishes a National Park Overflight Advisory Council which would provide advice and recommendations to the Park Service and the FAA on all issues related to commercial air tour flights over park units and serve as a national forum for interest groups, including representatives of the air tour industry and the environmental community, to exchange views constructively.It is significant to note that our bill will not affect emergency flight operations, general aviation, military aviation, or scheduled commercial passenger flights that transit National Park System units. Furthermore, recognizing the special needs for air travel in Alaska, this bill will not affect the management of park units or aircraft operations over or within park units in the State of Alaska.Mr. President, I believe that the legislation we are offering today will give us the tools to minimize the adverse effects of commercial air tour flights on park resources as well as on the ground visitor experience, while at the same time enhancing the safety of such flights. I believe it is a balanced measure that, through extensive opportunity for public involvement, attempts to accommodate the legitimate concerns of all park users, including air tour operators and passengers. Indeed, I strongly believe that under certain well-regulated conditions, air tourism provides an important service to many elderly, disabled, or other visitors who might otherwise never enjoy the wonders of our national parks.Nevertheless, our bill's central premise is that the 369 park units of the National Park System were created because of their exceptional natural or cultural significance to the American people. All of the provisions of the National Parks Airspace Management Act are therefore designed with the protection of park resources as their essential, if not exclusive, goal. For it is self-evident that a park whose values have been corrupted is a park ultimately not worth visiting, by air or land.Mr. President, in closing, I would like to acknowledge the fact that the senior Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] earlier this week introduced related legislation on park overflights. While his bill differs from ours in some details, the intent of both measures is the same--to mitigate the adverse effects of air tours flights on our national parks. Given our common goal, I hope that we can work together in crafting an effective, bipartisan approach to this troubling and divisive issue.Thank you, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support the National Parks Airspace Management Act of 1997. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.",

    "text": "Mr. President, the State of Hawaii, its delegation in Congress, and conservation organizations throughout the State are deeply concerned about Federal efforts to regulate hydroelectric power projects on State waters. The question of who should have authority for hydropower regulation--the State or the Federal Government--is very contentious.Those who care for Hawaii's rivers and streams recognize that continued Federal intervention may have serious repercussions for our fresh water resources and the ecosystems that depend upon them. Whenever a hydroelectric power project is proposed, a number of environmental considerations must be weighed before approval is granted. Important issues must be evaluated, such as whether the proposed dam or diversion will impair the stream's essential flow characteristics, or what effect the hydropower project will have on the physical nature of the stream bed or the chemical makeup of the water. Will a dam or diversion diminish flow rates and reduce the scenic value of one of Hawaii's waterfalls? Will it harm recreational opportunities? These, and other questions must be answered.The effect of a new dam or diversion on the State's disappearing wetlands must be weighed. Wetlands provide vital sanctuary for migratory birds, as well as habitat for endangered Hawaiian waterfowl. They serve as reservoirs for storm water, filtering water-borne pollutants before they reach the fragile coastal habitat, and provide a recharge area for groundwater.Historic resources may be at risk on streams when hydropower projects are proposed. When Polynesians first settled our islands, Hawaiian culture was linked to streams as much as it was linked to the sea. The remnants of ancient Hawaiian settlements can be found along many State rivers. Will the Federal Government give adequate attention to stream resources that have unique natural or cultural significance when it issues a hydroelectric license or permit?Most important of all, hydropower development must be compatible with preserving native aquatic resources. Hawaiian streams support many species that depend on undisturbed habitat. Perhaps the most remarkable of these species is the gobie, which can climb waterfalls and colonize stream sections that are inaccessible to other fish. These are some of the complex factors that must be considered during Federal hydropower decisionmaking.Federal agencies that have responsibility for fish, wildlife, and natural resource protection have raised questions about the State of Hawaii's commitment to protecting stream resources. They assert that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is better equipped than the State to protect environmental values.Nothing could be further from truth. The State of Hawaii has demonstrated its commitment to protect stream resources by instituting a new water code, adopting instream flow standards, launching a comprehensive Hawaii stream assessment, and organizing a stream protection and management task force.Meanwhile, FERC has shown little regard for stream protection and has granted a preliminary permit to a hydropower developer on the Hanalei River. This is the same river that the Fish and Wildlife Service is fighting to preserve. The Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge is the largest refuge on the island of Kauai, and is home to four endangered water birds. Sixty percent of the State's taro crop is grown in the wetlands adjacent to the river. When it comes to protecting environmental values, FERC is off to a very poor start.The experience with the proposed Hanalei hydropower project raises serious questions about appropriateness of the Federal efforts to regulate hydropower in Hawaii. Our rivers and streams bear no resemblance to the wide, deep, long, and relatively flat rivers of the continental United States. Hawaiian streams generally comprise groups of short riffles, runs, falls, and deep pools. There are only five streams with a length of 40 miles or more. Only two streams have a median flow rate greater than 100 cubic feet per second. By comparison, the mean discharge of the Mississippi River is nearly 40,000 times the annual flow of Hawaii's longest river, the Kiikii River.The Federal interest in protecting the vast interconnected river systems of North America is misplaced in our isolated mid-Pacific location. When it comes to regulating hydropower in Hawaii, FERC is a fish out of water. By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Brownback):S. 440. A bill to deauthorize the Animas-La Plata Federal reclamation project and to direct the Secretary of the Interior to enter into negotiations to satisfy, in a manner consistent with all Federal laws, the water rights interests of the Ute Mountain Ute Indian Tribe and the Southern Ute Indian Tribe; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to deauthorize the construction of the Animas-La Plata water project in Colorado. I am very pleased to be joined in this effort by the Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback]. This measure is identical to a bipartisan effort in the other body introduced on February 13, 1997, by my colleague from Wisconsin [Mr. Petri] and my colleague from Oregon [Mr. DeFazio]. The Animas-La Plata project is a $744 million water development project planned for southwest Colorado and northwest New Mexico that is largely taxpayer funded. Designed to supply 191,230 feet of water, it will consist of 2 major reservoirs, 7 pumping plants, and 200 miles of canals and pipes. The project will pump water over 1,000 feet uphill, consuming enough power to run a city of 60,000, to supply municipal, industrial, and irrigation interests.The legislation I am introducing today deauthorizes the Animas-La Plata Federal reclamation project and directs the Secretary of the Interior to work with the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute Tribes to find an alternative to satisfy their water rights needs. It is supported by a broad coalition of taxpayer and environmental groups that includes: Taxpayers for Common Sense, Americans for Tax Reform, Citizens Against Government Waste, Citizens for a Sound Economy, and National Taxpayers Union. This legislation was also profiled in the 1997 Green Scissors Report, and the Animas project has shown up on a number of deficit reduction target lists, including one recently proposed by the Chairman of the Budget Committee of the other body [Mr. Kasich].I believe that Federal legislation to terminate the Animas-La Plata project is needed for four reasons. First, as a Senator who is extremely concerned about the Federal deficit and debt, this project has an extremely high price tag--a projected total cost of $744 million in fiscal year 1998. That total projected cost estimate has increased $30 million over the fiscal year 1997 estimate of $714 million. The Federal share of that cost now exceeds half a billion dollars, $503 million to be exact, which is nearly 68 percent of the total cost. I believe, especially in these times of tight budgets, that commencement of significant Federal discretionary spending should be critically evaluated.By no measure or metric is this project cost effective, Mr. President. A July 1995 economic analysis by the Bureau of Reclamation, the only analysis that used economic procedures approved for Bureau analyses and a current discount rate, reported that the project's benefit-cost ratio is 0.36:1. In other words, Mr. President, the project will return only 36 cents for every taxpayer dollar invested. I am additionally concerned, Mr. President, because recent GAO reports have highlighted that Federal water projects, once built, do not recoup the costs of the projects from the users, who are supposed to be paying the government back for its investment. Municipal and industrial users are required under the Water Supply Act of 1958 to fully repay all the construction costs and operation and maintenance costs attributable to the supply of municipal and industrial water. Those repayment contracts are to be in place before construction begins. Currently, the Bureau has signed a repayment contract with two non-Indian project beneficiaries. Those that have been signed do not cover the construction costs of the full project, due to cost increases. It is questionable if the project will ever comply with the law and obtain full reimbursement of municipal and industrial costs from the project beneficiaries.Second, I am introducing this legislation because I believe that the Congress should support the State of Colorado's ongoing dialog over lower cost alternatives rather than proceed to initiate construction. The Animas-La Plata project has been the focus of controversy and litigation for many years. In response to legislative activities last Congress, which I will describe in further detail, Colorado Gov. Roy Romer and Lt. Gov. Gail Schoettler convened a discussion process in October 1996 with the Bureau of Reclamation, the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute Tribes, interested water districts, irrigators, and environmentalists in an attempt to resolve disputes among the parties. To assist in the success of this process, the Bureau and the other parties executed a legal ``stand still'' agreement establishing basic ground rules for the dialog and identifying the activities that could take place outside the process. While the eventual outcome is not known, a recommendation for a different formulation of the project is possible.Thus far, the Department of the Interior, acting through the Bureau, is committed to finding a solution acceptable to the parties in general, and to the Colorado Ute Tribes specifically, due to the Federal Government's tribal trust responsibility. My legislation will codify that direction by specifically directing the Bureau to continue with these negotiations, rather than proceed with Animas-La Plata.Third, this legislation has been drafted to acknowledge the importance of demonstrating support for ensuring that the Federal Government's obligations to the Colorado Ute Tribes are fulfilled. During debate over the fiscal year 1997 energy and water appropriations bill, colleagues will remember that I offered an amendment to terminate funding for Animas-La Plata. I believe that amendment was not successful last year due to concerns by colleagues that the project is necessary to fulfill Ute tribal water rights.As I made clear to colleagues during the appropriations debate, despite the contention that the project will address the Ute claims, Animas-La Plata was not initiated as a way to address these claims. This project was authorized in 1968 to supply irrigation water to farmers growing forage crops in arid areas. Even back then, in the heyday of big water projects, this one was riddled with so many problems it couldn't get going. In 1988, nearly 20 years after it was authorized, the settlement of the Ute Indian water rights claims became an additional justification for pushing this project through.Construction of this project has not yet begun because of a variety of factors, including concerns raised about the adequacy of the April 1996 Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, issues surrounding cost-sharing and repayment agreements, and compliance problems with New Mexico's water quality standards.Both the Ute Mountain Ute and the Southern Ute tribal governments formally support construction of Animas-La Plata. The water that the Utes will be provided from the project, however, is only a fraction of the project's total capacity. Of the 191,230 acre-feet of water the project will supply, two-thirds will go to nontribal interests with only 62,000 acre feet of the total to be supplied to both tribes. There is dissent within the Southern Ute Tribe about the wisdom of this project, and I am pleased that this legislation terminating the project has received the support of the Southern Ute Grassroots Organization.I am concerned that the Animas-La Plata as currently proposed cannot meet the needs of the tribes because the initial construction phase of the project will neither provide the delivery system nor the quantity of water needed to fully honor the Federal Government's commitments. We should not spend hundreds of million of dollars and still find the tribal needs potentially unmet. Rather, I want to see that the Bureau is engaged in actively solving these problems rather than half-heartedly moving forward with construction and at the negotiating table to examine alternatives. The Ute Tribes' water rights settlement says that if the project isn't built and fully functional by the year 2000, the tribes may void the settlement and go back into negotiations or litigation. Last year, the Bureau indicated that it cannot complete the project before 2003. It is not unreasonable to expect that the Utes may seek to void their settlement, wherein the non-Indian irrigators will get their expensive project and Congress in the year 2005 or so will have to fund a new water rights settlement.Finally, I believe that there needs to be a proactive legislative solution put forward to address the Animas-La Plata project because the political support for continued appropriations for this project is eroding. Last year, during the 104th Congress, the other body voted 221 to 200 to stop the funding for the Animas-La Plata project as it is currently designed. The chairman of the Budget Committee in the other body has put Animas-La Plata on a target list of corporate welfare cuts. I believe that during the appropriations cycle for fiscal year 1998, the other body will again vote to terminate funding for this project.Politically, we may go back and forth for a few years with the other body terminating funding and this body restoring the money. But eventually, both Houses of Congress will resist and we will have wasted millions of dollars.My bill seeks to put this project back on a positive track. It directs the Bureau of Reclamation to address legitimate water needs and explore all the alternatives to meeting those needs, and terminates this project that we can no longer afford. I ask unanimous consent that this measure be printed in the Record.Three being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Specter):S. 441. A bill to improve health care quality and reduce health care costs by establishing a national fund for health research that would significantly expand the Nation's investment in medical research; to the Committee on Finance.Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Specter to introduce the National Fund for Health Research Act. This legislation is similar to legislation I introduced with Senator Hatfield during the last Congress which gained broad bipartisan support in both the House and Senate.Our proposal would establish a national fund for health research to provide additional resources for health research over and above those provided to the National Institutes of Health [NIH] in the annual appropriations process. The fund would greatly enhance the quality of health care by investing more in finding preventive measures, cures, and cost-effective treatments for the major illnesses and conditions that strike Americans.To finance the fund, health plans would set aside approximately 1 percent of all health premiums and transfer the funds to the Department of the Treasury. The Department of the Treasury would then transfer the money to the national fund for health research.Each year under our proposal amounts within the national fund for health research would automatically be allocated to each of the NIH Institutes and Centers. Each Institute and Center would receive the same percentage as they received of the total NIH appropriation for that fiscal year. The set aside should generate sufficient funds to provide for a nearly 50-percent increase in funding for the NIH.In 1994, I argued that any health care reform plan should include additional funding for health research. Health care reform has been taken off the front burner but the need to increase our Nation's commitment to health research has not diminished.While health care spending devours nearly $1 trillion annually our medical research budget is dying of starvation. The United States devotes less than 2 percent of its total health care budget to health research. The Defense Department spends 15 percent of its budget on research. Does this make sense? The cold war is over but the war against disease and disability continues.Increased investment in health research is key to reducing health costs in the long run. If we can find the cure for a disease like Alzheimer's the savings would be enormous. Today, federally supported funding for research on Alzheimer's disease totals $300 million yet it is estimated that nearly $100 billion is expended annually on caring for people with Alzheimer's.Gene therapy and treatments for cystic fibrosis and Parkinson's could eliminate years of chronic care costs, while saving lives and improving patients' quality of life.Mr. President, Senator Specter and I do everything we can to increase funding for NIH through the appropriations process. But, given the current budget situation and freeze in discretionary spending what we can do is limited. Without action, our investment in medical research through the NIH is likely to continue to decline in real terms.The NIH is not able to fund even 25 percent of competing research projects or grant applications deemed worthy of funding. This is compared to rates of 30 percent or more just a decade ago. Science and cutting edge medical research is being put on hold. We may be giving up possible cures for diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and countless other diseases.Our lack of investment in research may also be discouraging our young people from pursuing careers in medical research. The number of people under the age of 36 even applying for NIH grants dropped by 54 percent between 1985 and 1993. This is due to a host of factors but I'm afraid that the lower success rates among applicants is making biomedical research less and less attractive to young people. If the perception is that funding for research is impossible to obtain, young people that may have chosen medical research 10 years ago will choose other career paths.Mr. President, I am pleased that over 130 groups representing patients, hospitals, medical schools, researchers, and millions of Americans have already endorsed our proposal. By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Kerry):S. 442. A bill to establish a national policy against State and local government interference with interstate commerce on the Internet or interactive computer services, and to exercise Congressional jurisdiction over interstate commerce by establishing a moratorium on the imposition of exactions that would interfere with the free flow of commerce via the Internet, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.Mr. President, a few weeks ago, I met with a group of small business folks at an Internet cafe in Portland. We talked about the promise electronic commerce holds for businesses and consumers. The Internet can give a small businessperson in Astoria, OR access to the entire global marketplace. It can give consumers, especially in rural areas, entry to a supernational shopping mall.For governments, the Internet offers a different type of promise--the chance to be a new cash cow. As Federal funds decrease, States and local governments are looking to the Internet as a new source of revenue. Some have already begun building tollbooths on the information superhighway. For sales taxes alone, there are nearly 6,500 different taxing authorities in this country. One businessman at the Internet cafe told me he is wary of getting into electronic commerce because of the prospect of as many as 30,000 different pairs of hands reaching into his pockets to collect taxes. If current trends continue, State and local levies will transform the Internet from a bright and exciting new frontier for commerce into a dark jungle of foreboding taxes.Under today's mishmash of State and local Internet taxes, everyone is puzzled. Take a customer at his home computer who purchases an item from a virtual catalogue. With the click of his mouse, the purchase is logged, his account billed and payment made by wire transfer and the order sent. The vendor is in another State, or even another country. His bank is in a third State and the purchase is a gift being sent to a relative in another State. Where did this transaction take place? Where was there nexus for tax purposes--the vendor State? The customer's State? The bank's location? Or the State where the gift is being sent? Is the answer all of the above, some of the above, or none of the above?The enormity of the problem is underscored by the fact that the hottest selling software today is software to help entrepreneurs and companies figure out various State tax policies.When a consumer in Corvallis, OR uses an Internet search engine in California, is that search a taxable service? When a housewife in Houston uses Virginia-based America Online to make a virtual purchase from a furniture company in North Carolina, what gets taxed where? Is an Internet service provider a public utility, as one State has ruled? Even if a State has enacted an online tax law, collection and enforcement are often haphazard. This system rewards ignorance and punishes the boy scout businesses that play by the rules.The purpose of the bill I am introducing today with Congressman Chris Cox is to allow everyone to step back and take a deep breath. It says let's suspend this crazy tax quilting bee so that everyone can come together in a rational way to figure out what policy makes the most sense.The Internet Tax Freedom Act has three parts. First, it would impose an indefinite moratorium on subnational taxes on electronic commerce. Where States and local governments have already imposed taxes on electronic commerce, their taxes would be grand fathered to the extent that they are net income taxes, fairly apportioned business license taxes or where the tax is collected in an identical way for mail or telephone orders. This will assure uniformity and fairness, while targeting inequitable technology taxes. Our intent is that the new tax moratorium apply to all Internet and interactive computer services, regardless of the technology--such as cable systems and wireless networks--being used to deliver those services. It will give us a functionally equivalent and technologically equitable tax policy. It will assure equity and fairness among all business entities and across technologies.Second, the bill would call upon the administration to bring together State and local governments, businesses and consumers, and any others with a stake in the Internet and online commerce to develop policy recommendations on taxation of the Internet and use of the Internet to deliver products and services. The Executive would have 2 years in which to prepare policy recommendations on taxation of the Internet.Third, the bill directs the executive branch to seek an international agreement making the Internet a duty-free zone. Just as we seek a rational policy on electronic commerce taxation here in the United States, our businesses cannot be expected to compete overseas if they faced more than 160 different foreign tariff policies covering global electronic commerce. Although about 75 percent of Web users live in North America, most electronic commerce is between companies, rather than companies and consumers. Forrester Research of Massachusetts predicts business-to-business commerce will soon be worth $67 billion a year.Trying to find out exactly which States and local authorities are imposing taxes on electronic commerce and what types of taxes they are imposing is a daunting--if not outright impossible--task in itself. The Vice President for a good-sized Internet service provider in California said he would need a whole department to untangle the various Internet tax laws around the country, ``It's in my nightmare pile,'' he observed. If this has stumped some of the best accounting firms in the country, how in the world can a small business that wants to sell over the Internet figure out its various tax liabilities? The difference between States in electronic commerce tax policy is mind-numbing.Twenty States and the District of Columbia impose one or more taxes on electronic commerce. New York levies taxes on gross receipts on the ``furnishing of information,'' but not on personal or individual information. Ohio taxes electronic transmissions and real estate data bases because they provide objective data but exempts news services because they provide analysis. Texas taxes the transmission of electronic information and software in whatever form, but does not tax software sent out of State on a disk. Alabama's Revenue Department ruled last fall that a utility tax applies to Internet service providers, forcing them to pay a 4-percent public utilities tax.Last year in Florida a small Internet service provider asked the State's Department of Revenue whether he should add a sales tax to his customers' monthly bills. He was certain he wouldn't have to since all net surfers there already pay 10 percent or more in taxes for the telephone service they use to link to the Internet. To his surprise, the Revenue Department said his customers should have been paying a 7-percent service tax under a decade-old telecommunications law. Then, adding shock to surprise, the Department told him his company was subject to an additional 2.5-percent tax on its gross annual receipts. The uproar from users and providers led the Governor to suspend the taxes until a panel could study the implications.The legislation is constructed in such a way as to set up a dynamic and productive tension. It gives those that seek revenue from electronic commerce--the States and local governments--an incentive to work with the administration in developing policy recommendations on Internet taxation. Indeed, the National Conference of State Legislatures wrote me on February 21 that they have been ``working with a number of other State organizations as well as the impacted private sector industries to find the common ground which will lead to the coordination and uniformity of State tax structures which the draft legislation desires.'' And an official with the Federal of Tax Administrators observed last summer that ``States need to figure out how to tax it [the Internet] and to make it a level playing field with other services.'' I will also continue to work with the Multistate Tax Commission to assure their efforts move forward.But the question remains: Will the simple imperative for good public policy outweigh the desire of cash-strapped States to tap a new source of revenue? Without a moratorium, as proposed in this legislation, I fear those State and local governments hungry for new sources of revenue have little, if any, incentive to work for a fair and equitable Internet tax policy.I want to thank a number of groups that have helped us craft this legislation, and which have indicated their support for this bill: the American Electronics Association, the Software Publishers Association, the Association of Online Professionals, the Committee on State Taxation, the Direct Marketing Association, the Business Software Alliance, the Information Technology Association of America, the U.S. Telephone Association, the California State Board of Taxation, the Massachusetts High Tech Council, CommerceNet, the Silicon Valley Software Industry Coalition, IBM, AT&amp;T, and other companies.I view the legislation being introduced today as the beginning of a process, not the end. It remains a work in progress and will hopefully continue to be refined throughout the congressional hearing process.There is a great deal to learn in these unchartered waters. All of us--Congress, State and local governments, businesses and consumers--must educate each other about how this new electronic medium works. We must all work together to help it achieve its full potential as a marketplace of ideas, products, and services.I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.Thee being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,This Act may be cited as the ``Internet Tax Freedom Act''.The Congress finds the following: (1) As a massive global network spanning not only State but international borders, the Internet is inherently a matter of interstate and foreign commerce within the jurisdiction of the United States Congress under Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution. (2) Even within the United States, the Internet does not respect State lines and operates independently of State boundaries. Addresses on the Internet are designed to be geographically indifferent. Internet transmissions are insensitive to physical distance and can have multiple geographical addresses. (3) Because transmissions over the Internet are made through packet-switching it is impossible to determine with any degree of certainty the precise geographic route or endpoints of specific Internet transmissions and infeasible to separate intrastate from interstate, and domestic from foreign, Internet transmissions. (4) Inconsistent and inadministrable taxes imposed on Internet activity by State and local governments threaten not only to subject consumers, businesses, and other users engaged in interstate and foreign commerce to multiply, confusing, and burdensome taxation, but also to restrict the growth and continued technological maturation of the Internet itself, and to call into question the continued viability of this dynamic medium. (5) Because the tax laws and regulations of so many jurisdictions were established before the Internet or interactive computer services, their application to this new medium in unintended and unpredictable ways threatens every Internet user, access provider, vendor, and interactive computer service provider. (6) The electronic marketplace of services, products, and ideas available through the Internet or interactive computer services can be especially beneficial to senior citizens, the physically challenged, citizens in rural areas, and small businesses. It also offers a variety of uses and benefits for educational institutions and charitable organizations. (7) Consumers, businesses, and others engaging in interstate and foreign commerce through the Internet or interactive computer services could become subject to more than 30,000 separate taxing jurisdictions in the United States alone. (8) The consistent and coherent national policy regarding taxation of Internet activity, and the concomitant uniformity, simplicity, and fairness that is needed to avoid burdening this evolving form of interstate and foreign commerce can best be achieved by the United States exercising its authority under Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution.(a) Moratorium.--Except as otherwise provided in this section, no State or political subdivision thereof may impose, assess, or attempt to collect a tax directly or indirectly on-- (1) the Internet or interactive computer services; or (2) the use of the Internet or interactive computer services. (b) Preservation of State and Local Taxing Authority.-- Subsection (a)-- (1) does not apply to taxes imposed on or measured by net income derived from the Internet or interactive computer services; (2) does not apply to fairly apportioned business license taxes applied to businesses having a business location in the taxing jurisdiction; and (3) does not affect a State or political subdivision thereof of authority to impose a sales or use tax on sales or other transactions effected by the use of the Internet or interactive computer services if-- (A) the tax is the same as the tax generally imposed and collected by that State or political subdivision thereof on interstate sales or transactions effected by mail order, telephone, or other remote means within its taxing jurisdiction; and (B) the obligation to collect the tax from sales or other transactions effected by the use of the Internet or interactive computer services is imposed on the same person or entity as in the case of sales or transactions effected by mail order, telephone, or other remote means.(a) Consultative Group.--The Secretaries of the Treasury, Commerce, and State, in consultation with appropriate committees of the Congress, consumer and business groups, States and political subdivisions thereof, and other appropriate groups, shall-- (1) undertake an examination of United States and international taxation of the Internet and interactive computer services, as well as commerce conducted thereon; and (2) jointly submit appropriate policy recommendations concerning United States domestic and foreign policies toward taxation of the Internet and interactive computer services, if any, to the President within 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act. (b) President.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the President shall transmit to the appropriate committees of Congress policy recommendations on the taxation of sales and other transactions affected on the Internet or through interactive computer services. (c) Recommendations To Be Consistent With Telecommunications Act of 1996 Policy Statement.--The Secretaries and the President shall take care to ensure that any policy recommendations are fully consistent with the policy set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 230(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230(b)).It is the sense of the Congress that the President should seek bilateral and multilateral agreements through the World Trade Organization, the Organization for Economic Cooperation Council, or other appropriate international fora to establish that activity on the Internet and interactive computer services is free from tariff and taxation.",

    "title": "ASIAN-AMERICANS AND THE POLITICAL FUNDRAISING INVESTIGATION",
    "text": "Mr. President, as we prepare for hearings on campaign fundraising irregularities, I would like to express concern about the negative impact that this issue is having on the image of the Asian-American community.Mr. President, Asian-Americans are an important part of our body politic. They have made significant contributions to politics, business, industry, science, sports, education, and the arts. Men and women like Senator Dan Inouye, Kristy Yamaguchi, Tommy Kono, I.M. Pei, David Henry Hwang, An Wang, and Ellison Onizuka have enhanced and invigorated the life of the Nation.Indeed, Asian-Americans have played a fundamental part in making this country what it is today. Asian immigrants helped build the great transcontinental railroads of the 19th century. They labored on the sugar plantations of Hawaii, on the vegetable and fruit farms of California, and in the gold mines of the West. They were at the forefront of the agricultural labor movement, especially in the sugarcane and grape fields, and were instrumental in developing the fishing and salmon canning industries of the Pacific Northwest. They were importers, merchants, grocers, clerks, tailors, and gardeners. They manned the assembly lines during America's Industrial Revolution. They operated laundries, restaurants, and vegetable markets. They also served our Nation in war: the famed all-nisei 100th/442d combat team of World War II remains the most decorated unit in U.S. military history.Despite their historical contributions, Asian immigrants and Asian-Americans have suffered social prejudice and economic, political, and institutional discrimination. They were excluded from churches, barber shops, and restaurants. They were forced to sit in the balconies of movie theaters and the back seats of buses. They were required to attend segregated schools. They were even denied burial in white cemeteries--in one instance, a decorated Asian-American soldier killed in action was refused burial in his hometown cemetery. Rather than receive equal treatment, Asians on the whole were paid lower wages than their white counterparts, relegated to menial jobs, or forced to turn to businesses and industries in which competition with whites was minimized.For more than 160 years, Asians were also refused citizenship by a law that denied their right to naturalize, a law that remained in effect until 1952. Without citizenship, Asians could not vote, and thus could not seek remedies through the Tammany Halls or other political organizations as did other immigrant groups. The legacy of this injustice is seen today in the relative lack of political influence and representation of Asian-Americans at every level and in every branch of government.Additionally, Asians were denied immigration rights. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 singled out Chinese on a racial basis, and the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1908 and the National Origins Act of 1924 prohibited Japanese immigration--while permitting the annual entry of thousands of immigrants from Ireland, Italy, and Poland. The 1924 law also allowed European immigrants to bring their wives from their homelands, but barred the entry of women from China, Japan, Korea, and India. Even Asians who were United States citizens were prohibited from bringing Asian wives into the country. Conversely, the 1922 Cable Act provided that any American woman who married an Asian would lose her citizenship. It was not until the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act eliminated immigration by national origins that the vestiges of these legal restrictions were lifted.Asians were also targeted by laws prohibiting them from owning property. The alien land laws passed by California and other Western and Southern States earlier this century, fostered by nativists and envious competitors, placed heavy obstacles in the path of struggling Asian immigrants and their children that were not faced by others.Perhaps most egregiously, Asians were denied civil rights guaranteed under the Constitution. The relocation of Asian-Americans from the west coast and Hawaii and their detention in internment camps between 1941 and 1946 is one of the worst civil rights violation in our history. One hundred twenty thousand men, women, and children of Japanese descent, two-thirds of them citizens, were incarcerated behind barbed wire fences, without due process or evidence of wrongdoing, under the grim view of machine gun towers. German-Americans or Italian-Americans did not suffer a similar fate. In the process, Americans of Asian ancestry were torn from their friends, their loved ones, their property, and their faith in the American dream. It was only in 1988, through legislation sponsored by Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, and others who serve in this body today, that the U.S. Government officially apologized for this injustice.The reasons for historical prejudice and discrimination against Asians are complex, often involving economic or political motives. For example, at one time European immigrant labor groups felt threatened by cheap Asian labor and staged strikes and acts of violence against Asians. Employers cultivated such ethnic antagonism as a stratagem to depress wages for all workers, Asian and European. Nativists used Asians as a foil for their racist philosophies. Politicians cynically exploited anti-Asian sentiment to maintain power. And the press used the ``Yellow Peril'', the specter of unlimited ``oriental'' immigration, to sell papers. But at heart, the reasons for anti-Asian practices remain far simpler: Asians looked different, they had accents, they worshipped different gods. They came from cultures and spoke languages that were beyond the narrow experience of traditional, white America.Thus, Asians and Asian-Americans were targets. Unlike other contemporaneous immigrants--Irish, Italians, Poles, Jews--Asians stood out; they could not blend into the majority white population. Asians were naturally suspect for their skin color and appearance: they looked different so many Americans believed they must be different; that is to say, somehow less than true-blooded American. In many instances, the reaction of Asians was to turn inward, to establish their own communities or ghettoes, like Chinatown or Japantown, or turn to small businesses or farms where they did not have to compete for employment against Caucasians--further isolating and insulating their communities from the rest of American society.In time, however, Asians became more integrated in American life. The progeny of immigrants were born citizens, spoke only English, watched television and went to the movies, danced to the latest music, and felt they earned their place in society through workplace contributions and military service. As they assimilated, Asian-Americans enjoyed success in many areas of endeavor; in fact, they have been so successful that Asian-Americans have been cited as the ``model minority.'' Today, Asian-Americans tend to have high educational achievement, some are prominent in business and the professions, and they have been cited by social scientists for having community spirit, a sense of fiscal responsibility, and a strong work ethic.But the model minority image is mythical in many respects. On average, Asian-Americans earn less than Caucasians. There is a significant income disparity between Asians and whites with equal education. Asian-Americans also tend to be located in secondary labor markets, where wages are low and prospects minimal, and occupy lower or technical positions, where income potential is not as great as in the executive ranks. Proportionately fewer Asian-Americans are managers than is the case with other population groups; they constitute less than half of 1 percent of the officers and directors of the Nation's thousand largest companies. In corporate America, Asian-Americans have their own ``glass ceiling.''In addition, many Americans mistakenly view the successful assimilation of more established, affluent groups such as Chinese-Americans and Japanese-Americans as the community norm. They do not realize that the community is extremely diverse in terms of ethnicity and recency of immigration. The more recent arrivals from Southeast Asia--for example, Vietnamese, Thais, Cambodians, Laotians--have significantly lower levels of income, education, and occupational advancement.Perhaps because of their success, perceived and otherwise, Asian-Americans continue to suffer for their minority status. They are periodically targets of hate crimes. The 1982 baseball bat killing of Vincent Chin in Detroit, a scapegoat for the Detroit auto industry's inability to compete with Japan, illustrated America's ignorance about Asian-Americans--Chin was of Chinese, not Japanese, heritage--and the inequality of justice for Asian-Americans--the killers paid a fine of $3,780 and never served jail time. In 1987, teenagers chanting, ``Hindu, Hindu,'' beat a young Indian-American to death. These are not isolated incidents. Last year, a report by the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium found that hate crimes against Asian Pacific-Americans grew from 335 incidents in 1993 to 458 incidents in 1995, a 37 percent increase in just two years.These violent incidents have been paralleled and surely fed by a growing national xenophobia. The fear of things foreign has manifested itself in cutbacks in international programs; the growth of the English only movement; and the passage of California's proposition 187 and Federal legislation to curtail social services to undocumented aliens and legal residents. Fear of Asians and other minorities is also seen in proposals to rollback minority language provisions of the Voting Rights Act and in broadbased attacks on affirmative action in education, employment, and contracting.I recall that only a few years ago, during the height of the debate over the budget deficit, much was made of the fact that a significant portion of our debt was held by Japan, but overlooked was the fact that both the British and Dutch had far greater investments in United States debt and property than the Japanese. Likewise, Japanese purchases of signature properties like Pebble Beach and Rockefeller Center received sensationalized coverage, but few stories traced the decline and eventual sale of these high-profile investments to other owners.Today, with the hype and hoopla surrounding Asians and Asian-Americans involved in the fundraising controversy, we see hints of the kinds of anti-Asian treatment that have been practiced in the past.The first and most obvious of these is the inappropriate and misguided attention paid by the media, commentators, and public figures to the ethnic heritage of those involved in the fundraising controversy. For example, an early Washington Post front page headline trumpeted an ``Asian Funds Network.'' However, upon a careful examination of the article, the reader found the article was principally concerned with Asian-Americans, not Asians. Clearly, in some quarters, ``Asian'' and ``Asian-American'' are synonymous, unlike the case with Europeans and European-Americans. In fact, the term ``European'' Americans is rarely heard in public discourse, because the ethnic origin of European Americans is not presumed to have a bearing on their patriotism.Despite the fact that Asian-Americans have paid taxes, lived and worked here for several generations, and died in military service, a different standard applies: Asian-Americans are still deemed to have an extraordinary, perhaps sinister, connection to their countries of origin.Mr. President, I think that I speak for the entire Asian-American community in expressing the hope that we can get to the bottom of this whole controversy, wherever the cards may fall. Those responsible for violations of laws or improper conduct should be identified and appropriately dealt with by the relevant authorities. However, I know that Asian-Americans also agree that the gratuitous attention to the heritage and citizenship of John Huang and other fundraisers is unjust and destructive. According to the press and others, John Huang isn't simply a DNC fundraiser or even an Asian-American fundraiser; rather, he is referred to as a ``Taiwan-born naturalized citizen with ties to an Indonesian conglomerate'' or, worse, ``an ethnic Chinese with overseas connections.''Last fall, during an appearance at the University of Pennsylvania, Presidential candidate Ross Perot erroneously referred to John Huang as an ``Indonesian businessman.'' Later, alluding to the fundraising controversy, Mr. Perot rhetorically asked his audience, ``Wouldn't you like to have someone out there named O'Reilly? Out there hard at work. You know, so far we haven't found an American name.'' The implication of these and other characterizations is that being Asian and naturalized, rather than of European stock and native born, somehow renders one less American.Mr. President, this hyphenation or qualification of citizenship status is one of the subtle ways in which Asian-Americans are cast as different and therefore suspicious. To some, Asians and Asian-Americans are the Fu Manchus of Hollywood legend--evil, cunning, and inscrutable Easterners who march in lockstep to some hidden agenda. According to this view, being of Filipino or Thai or Pakistani heritage is all the same--if your skin is yellow or brown, you are alleged to share certain invidious characteristics of your race; your individualism fades into a kind of monolithic group identity.Thus, all Asians and Asian-Americans are, by extension, responsible for John Huang's or Charlie Trie's or Johnny Chung's alleged misdeeds. Furthermore, goes this circular reasoning, since it is accepted that Asians lack individualism, John Huang, Charlie Trie, and Johnny Chung must be part of an Asian conspiracy.A columnist for the New York Times played on this stereotype when, in a series of editorials last year, he wrote of the ``penetration of the White House by Asian interests'' and characterized John Huang as ``the well-subsidized Lippo operative placed high inside Clinton Commerce.'' The columnist also referred to an ``Asian connection'' which provided contributions through ``front men with green cards.'' Even the respected Wall Street Journal described some of John Huang's donations as coming from ``people with tenuous connections to this country,'' although it is unclear whether it was referring to Asian residents or Asian-Americans.A more recent manifestation of this stereotype can be found on this week's cover of the National Review, which depicts President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton with slanted eyes, buckteeth, and wearing a coolie hat and Mao cap, respectively, over the headline, ``The Manchurian Candidates.'' This is a true low for reporting standards, more reminiscent of William Randolph Hearst's Yellow Press than of modern journalism. Some irresponsible publications, in the interests of sensationalism, are obviously more than willing to conflate racist stereotypes with modern standards of objective journalism. The President, Mrs. Clinton, and the Asian-American community are owed an apology for this gross affront to decency and taste.Mr. President, a second major fallout of the fundraising affair is the impression fostered by the media and commentators that legal Asian-American participation in the political process is illegitimate. Charges of undue influence on the part of the Asian-American community have been raised with regard to immigration policy, specifically, the ``fourth preference'' category that allows siblings of citizens to immigrate.The press makes much of the fact that Asian-Americans who are concerned about this matter also contributed money to the campaign. Certainly Asian-Americans, the majority of whom are immigrants, wish to be reunited with their families. However, it is improper to imply that contributions to political campaigns by Asian-Americans should be held to a higher standard or any more suspect than contributions by other Americans. This is tantamount to suggesting that the practice of giving to political campaigns should be limited only to non-Asians.A third troublesome impact of the fundraising allegations is the overhasty and excessive reaction to the issue of legal contributions by permanent residents. In the wake of the ``Asian donor'' story, proposals have been made to eliminate their eligibility to make political contributions. Alarmed by the public fallout of the controversy, the Clinton administration and the Democratic National Committee have preemptively decided not to accept contributions from permanent residents or U.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations. And a number of Members of Congress have returned contributions made by permanent residents who are Asian, not because the contributions were illegal but because they feared the public's reaction to their accepting ``Asian'' money.Mr. President, I acknowledge that there are legitimate concerns regarding the wisdom of allowing permanent residents to make contributions to political campaigns, apart from the possibility that proscribing such contributions may violate the free speech rights accorded all residents, citizens and aliens alike, by the Constitution. As my colleagues know, the Supreme Court has held that campaign contributions are an activity protected by the first amendment, and that the first amendment rights of legal residents are fully protected.In this instance, however, I am more concerned by the possibility that the only reason why campaign contributions by permanent residents has become an issue now is because, for the first time, Asians and Asian-Americans happen to be involved in a major way. Evidence of this perhaps can be seen in the DNC's private audit of supposedly suspect contributions.Reportedly, DNC auditors asked Asian-American donors whether they were citizens, how they earn their money, if they would provide their tax returns, and other intrusive questions, while threatening to tell the press if the donors did not cooperate. Some of the Asian-Americans contacted were longtime political contributors with impeccable reputations, who were naturally outraged. The DNC audit clearly smacked of selective harassment of those who happened to have Asian surnames; it underscores the Asian-American community's fear that they are being asked to pay for the alleged transgressions of a handful of individuals who happen to be of Asian heritage.Mr. President, a fourth major concern of the fundraising affair is that it has undermined Asian-American leadership opportunities in Government. According to some analyses, the fundraising affair impelled the Clinton administration to drop from consideration the names of University of California-Berkeley Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien and former U.S. Congressman Norm Mineta for the positions of Secretary of Energy and Secretary of Transportation, respectively. Thus far, no Asian-American has ever held Cabinet rank, and only a handful are represented in the senior ranks of Government. Furthermore, I would not be surprised to learn that every Asian-American candidate for political appointment is currently being scrutinized for contacts he or she may have had, no matter how innocent, with the Asian and Asian-American principals in the fundraising investigation. As a consequence, I greatly fear that promising Asian-American candidates for responsible Federal office will fall by the wayside, victims of guilt by association.A fifth and perhaps most serious impact of the fundraising story, however, is its long-term effect on Asian-American participation in the political process. Last year, a record 75,000 Asian-Americans registered to vote, a sign of the Asian-American community's newfound confidence and political maturity. I am deeply concerned that biased scrutiny of Asians and Asian-Americans by the press, politicians, and investigators will kill this initial flowering of a historically quiescent and apolitical community, a flowering that led to the historic election of an Asian-American to governorship of a mainland State.Will this scandal confirm Asian-Americans' fears that the system is rigged against them, discouraging them from participating in the development of public policy in a meaningful way? If so, this would be tragic for a community that is by far the fastest growing in the Nation, which is expected to comprise 7 percent of the population by 2020, and which has so many skills and experiences to offer our country. This tragedy would be compounded for those immigrants recently escaped from the yoke of authoritarianism, who might find the consequences of political activism reminiscent of the penalties experienced in their countries of origin.In conclusion, Mr. President, as we investigate the fundraising affair, let us remember the bigotry, prejudice, and discrimination faced by Asian immigrants and Asian-Americans as they struggled for acceptance in the New World. Let us recall how they overcame steep social, economic, and institutional barriers to become valuable, contributing members of society.With this in mind, Mr. President, let us keep our attention on matters of substance--the laws that were possibly broken, the processes and procedures that were bent, the individuals who circumvented or corrupted the system, and most of all what we can do to prevent abuses in the future. These are the real issues at hand.By the same token, Mr. President, let us avoid focusing on such irrelevancies as the ethnicity of the participants in this affair. Let us cease characterizing individuals by meretricious stereotypes; conversely, let us avoid judging an entire community by the actions of a few individuals. To do otherwise, Mr. President, would be a grave disservice to the seven million Americans of Asian ancestry who are valued and rightful participants in our great democratic experiment.Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of articles by Robert Wright and Frank Wu addressing Asian-Americans and the fundraising controversy be printed in the Record following my remarks.",

    "text": "Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation that I have sponsored in the past two Congresses to provide a measure of tax relief to working families throughout America. My bill would restore value to the child and dependent care credit by allowing an annual adjustment of the credit for inflation.Mr. President, as the Federal Government and the states work to move people from welfare to work, the problems faced by working Americans seeking affordable, quality child-care services for their children will likely worsen. The availability and affordability of adequate child care are the principal concerns expressed by an increasing number of middle-class working parents. Many parents are forced to patch together a network of child care providers to secure care for their children.The evidence in support of improving the child and dependent care credit is clear. The number of single mothers working outside the home has dramatically increased in recent years. More than 56 percent of all mothers with children under 6 years work outside the home, and over 70 percent of women with children over age 6 are in the labor market.The percentage of Hawaii households in which both parents work outside the home is even higher than the national average. According to projections developed by the Bank of Hawaii based on the 1990 Census, 61.8 percent of all Hawaii families have both parents employed, and 71.3 percent of all households have at least two individuals in the workforce.The increased participation of single mothers in the labor market and the large number of two-parent families in which both parents work outside the home have made the dependent care credit one of the most popular and productive tax incentives ever enacted by Congress. Unfortunately, the value of the credit has declined significantly over the years as inflation has slowly eaten away at the value of this benefit. Measured in constant dollars, the maximum credit of $2,400 has decreased in value by more than 45 percent since 1982.In 1981, the flat credit for dependent care was replaced with a scale to give the greatest benefit of the credit to lower income working families. Since that time, neither the adjusted gross income figures employed in the scale, nor the limit on the amount of employment-related expenses used to calculate the credit, has been adjusted for inflation. My bill provides a measure of much needed relief to working American families. It would index the child and dependent care credit and restore the full benefit of the credit.The maximum amount of employment-related child care expenses allowed under current law--$2,400 for a single child and $4,800 for two or more children--has simply failed to keep pace with escalating care costs. Unlike other tax credits and deductions provided taxpayers in the Internal Revenue Code, the dependent care credit is not adjusted for inflation.Without an adjustment for inflation, we will continue to diminish the purpose of this credit to offset the expense of dependent and child care services incurred by parents working outside the home. While the cost of quality child care has increased as demand exceeds supply, the dependent care credit has failed to keep up with the spiraling costs. My legislation addresses this chronic problem by automatically adjusting the dependent and child care credit for inflation. Under this legislation, both the dollar limit on the amount creditable and the limitation on earned income would be adjusted annually.Mr. President, the average cost for out of home child care exceeds $3,500 per child, per year. Child care or dependent care expenses can seriously strain a family's budget. This burden can become unbearable for single parents, almost invariably single mothers, who must balance the need to work with their parental responsibilities.Middle-class Americans are working harder than ever to maintain their standard of living. In many families, parents have been forced to work longer hours, deplete their savings, and go deeper into debt. There is an urgent need to enact changes in our tax code that are pro-family and pro-children. The Working Families Child Care Tax Relief Act meets both of these goals.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.",

    "title": "RETIREMENT OF BILL BREW",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today to note the impending retirement of Mr. William E. Brew, who currently serves as the minority general counsel of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. As of April 4, his retirement date, Bill will have served 19 years and 1 day as a loyal and dedicated staff member of the U.S. Senate.A veteran of the Vietnam war, Bill has held increasingly important positions of responsibility on the staff of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. Since he was hired by Senator Alan Cranston in 1978, Bill has served as associate counsel, associate general counsel, minority counsel, deputy general counsel, general counsel, and most recently, minority general counsel to the committee.Through the many political changeovers in the administration and Congress in his nearly two decades on Capitol Hill, Bill provided institutional continuity, serving as a source of reliable information and wise advice on legislation, policy, and procedure for Members of both parties.Bill was closely involved in developing all of the major veterans initiatives that were enacted by Congress during this period. Among his major accomplishments are legislation relating to agent orange compensation, establishment of judicial review of veterans claims, establishment of the U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals, and creation of programs relating to the readjustment needs of Vietnam and post-Vietnam veterans.In addition to these special accomplishments, Bill worked hard to become the Senate's foremost authority on veterans health care matters. He served as an invaluable resource to members of the committee on the medical needs of the diverse, 27 million-strong veterans population as well as on the legal, administrative, and structural nuances of the hundreds of Department of Veterans Affairs' hospitals, outpatient clinics, nursing homes, and domiciliaries.Bill is well known for his logical, analytical, and deliberative mind. His patience and fairness are legendary, and few have been as adept at working in the heated, give-and-take atmosphere of the legislative process. His adherence to the very highest personal and professional standards has been a credit to the U.S. Senate. In short, Bill has been the veteran's veteran, that special individual whom Senators, professional staffers, administration officials, and veterans advocates have trusted to render an objective assessment on any particular veterans issue or to undertake any worthy cause in behalf of those who served.Mr. President, I believe that I have a special insight into the qualities of this outstanding individual. In the days and months immediately following my appointment to the U.S. Senate in 1990, Bill Brew was one of the experienced hands who helped indoctrinate me in the complexities of veterans policy and the doings of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Since then, I and my staff have relied on him for advice on issues major and minor. Whatever success I have had in the way of veterans legislation is in great measure due to his assistance.Indeed, no one worked longer or harder to improve the condition of Hawaii's 120,000 veterans than Bill Brew. It was his experience and energy that fueled a series of committee investigations revealing VA's historical neglect of the Aloha State's veterans. As a consequence of these inquiries, VA established four new primary care clinics and readjustment counseling centers in Hawaii; tripled the size of the Honolulu outpatient clinic; began preparations to construct a VA medical center on Oahu; and, established a unique residential treatment center for Pacific-area veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.So, Mr. President, it is with great reluctance that I extend Bill a fond farewell. I offer him my deep gratitude for the service he has rendered me and other members of this body over the last two decades. No one has worked harder to advance the public interest than this stellar public servant. I wish him well in all his future endeavors. ",

Ed has served in this position since his confirmation by the Senate in May 1993, after being nominated by President Clinton.As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have greatly appreciated Ed's successful efforts to maintain close relations with legislators and keep Congress apprised of VA operations, programs, and policies. During his tenure, VA confronted the impact of judicial review on veterans' claims; addressed the health care, research, and compensation needs of Persian Gulf veterans suffering from undiagnosed illnesses; and, in the face of unprecedented fiscal pressures, began the most comprehensive restructuring of its health care and benefits administrations in history. Ed has played a critical role in developing and implementing VA's response to each of these challenges, while keeping Congress fully informed of, and involved in, major developments.Mr. President, prior to his administration appointment, Ed enjoyed a long and varied career in public service. After graduating cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1963, where he was Law Review editor, he clerked for New Jersey Supreme Court Associate Justice Nathan Jacobs. He then joined the Air Force for 3 years, working as an assistant staff judge advocate at Keesler Air Force Base before retiring in the rank of captain. Soon after, he joined the Peace Corps, serving as deputy director and, later, country director, in Korea. Returning to the United States, he signed on as a staff attorney to the Mental Health Law Project in Washington, DC. In 1977, he joined the staff of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, thus embarking on a long and distinguished career in the veterans arena. In the 16 years he was employed on the committee staff, he alternately served as majority and minority general counsel and, ultimately, staff director and chief counsel.As a committee staffer, Ed was instrumental in creating the Vet Center Program, enacting the Montgomery GI bill, elevating VA to cabinet rank, and establishing the U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals. During the 102d Congress, one of the most productive legislative periods in the committee's history, he helped revamp VA physician pay, improve homeless veterans programs, create a fairer system of compensation for survivors of disabled veterans, bring educational benefits in line with inflation, heighten concern for minority veterans, and establish a program to help treat women who were sexually abused in the military. In addition, under the leadership of my distinguished colleagues, Senator Daschle and Senator Rockefeller, respectively, he helped resolve controversial matters relating to agent orange exposure and VA drug pricing.Mr. President, I should also note that Ed played an important role in improving health care benefits and services for Hawaii's 120,000 veterans. Ed had an opportunity to visit Hawaii, gaining firsthand an appreciation of the unique needs of our multiethnic veterans population as well as of the special problems that confront the community as a consequence of Hawaii's insular geography and isolation from the mainland. He materially supported the Hawaii Delegation's efforts, initiated by my late predecessor, Senator Spark Matsunaga, to establish a VA medical center on Oahu; triple the size of the Honolulu VA outpatient clinic; and, establish vet centers, primary care clinics, and a residential post-traumatic stress disorder treatment center in the neighbor islands.Mr. President, however extensive Ed's achievements, what is most remarkable about this good man is the grace and sense of balance he has brought to public service. In dealing with many different organizations and personalities, each with a separate agenda, often on extremely contentious issues, he brought calm to rough waters and comfort to bruised egos. His willingness to consider every side to an issue, his ability to rise above partisan and personal concerns, truly elevated the level of debate on veterans issues. By his example, he constantly reminded us of our primary obligation, which is to promote the welfare of veterans.Thank you, Mr. President. Ed's departure from public service is a loss to all who care about good government. I offer him and his wife, Jane, my best wishes as they embark on a new, and I hope rewarding, phase of life. ",

    "text": "Mr. President, last year marked the 150th anniversary of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment dedicated to the ``increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.'' Since its founding, the Smithsonian has promoted excellence in research and public education in all fields of human and scientific interest. To continue this great tradition of excellence, and to ensure its relevance to its patrons and beneficiaries, the American people, today I am introducing legislation, cosponsored by Senator Carol Moseley-Braun and Senator Patty Murray, to establish a new Smithsonian entity, the National Museum for the Peopling of America.The Peopling of America Museum would be dedicated to presenting one of the most significant experiences in American history, the complex movement of people, ideas, and cultures across boundaries--both internal or external--that resulted in the peopling of the Nation and the development of our unique, pluralist society. This movement transformed us from strangers from different shores into neighbors unified in our inimitable diversity--Americans all.Under our bill, the Museum would have a number of different functions. These include serving as: A location for exhibits and programs depicting the history of America's diverse peoples and their interactions with each other. The exhibits would collectively form a unified narrative of the historical processes by which the United States was developed; A center for research and scholarship to ensure that future generations of scholars will have access to resources necessary for telling the story of American pluralism; A repository for the collection of relevant artifacts, artworks, and documents to be preserved, studied, and interpreted; A venue for integrated public education programs, including lectures, films, and seminars, based on the Center's collections and research; and A location for a standardized index of resources within the Smithsonian dealing with the heritages of all Americans. The Smithsonian's holdings contain millions of artifacts which have not been identified or classified for this purpose.A clearinghouse for information on ethnic documents, artifacts, and artworks that may be available through non-Smithsonian sources, such as other federal agencies, museums, academic institutions, individuals, or foreign entities.A folklife center highlighting the cultural expressions of the peoples of the United States. The existing Smithsonian Center for Folklife Programs and Cultural Studies, which already performs this function, could be integrated with the museum.A center to promote mutual understanding and tolerance. The Museum would facilitate programs designed to encourage greater understanding of, and respect for, each of America's diverse ethnic and cultural heritages. The Museum would also disseminate techniques of conflict resolution currently being developed by social scientists.An oral history center developed through interviews with volunteers and visitors. The museum would also serve as an oral history repository and a clearinghouse for oral histories held by other institutions.A visitor center providing individually tailored orientation guides to Smithsonian visitors. Visitors could use the museum as an initial orientation phase for ethnically or culturally related artifacts, artworks, or information that can be found in each of the Smithsonian's many facilities.A location for training museum professionals in museum practices relating to the life, history, art, and culture of the peoples of the United States. The museum would sponsor training programs for professionals or students involved in teaching, researching, and interpreting the heritage of America's peoples.A location for testing and evaluating new museum-related technologies that could facilitate the operation of the museum. The facility could serve as a test bed for cutting-edge technologies that could later be used by other private or public museums.Our legislation also stipulates that the museum would be located in new or existing Smithsonian facilities on or near the National Mall. Additionally, the measure establishes an Advisory Committee on American Cultural Heritage to provide guidance on the operation and direction of the proposed museum.Mr. President, aside from the first Americans, whose precedence must be acknowledged, we Americans were travelers from other lands. From the first Europeans who came as explorers and conquerors to the African slaves who endured the middle passage and labored in the fields of our early plantations, from the people of Nuevo Mexico to the French of the Louisiana Territory who became Americans through annexation, from the Irish who fled poverty and famine at home to the Chinese who came in search of Gold Mountain--all were once visitors to this great country.America is defined by the grand, entangled progress of its individual peoples to and across the American landscape--through exploration, the slave trade, immigration, or internal migration--that gave rise to the rich interactions that make the American experience unique. We embody the cultures and traditions that our forebears brought from other shores, as well as the new traditions and cultures that we adopted on arrival.Whether we settled in the agrarian West, the industrialized North, the small towns of the Midwest, or the genteel cities of the South, our forebears inevitably formed relationships with peoples of other backgrounds and cultures. Our rich heritage as Americans is comprehensible only through the histories of our various constituent cultures, carried with us from other lands and transformed by encounters with other cultures. As one eminent cultural scholar has noted:How can one learn about slavery, holocausts, immigration, ecological adaptation or ways of seeing the world without some type of comparative perspective, without some type of relationship between cultures and peoples. How can we understand the history of any one cultural group--for example, the Irish--without reference to other groups--for example, the British. How can we understand African American culture without placing it in some relationship to its diverse African cultural roots, the creolized cultures of the Caribbean, the Native American bases of Maroon and Black Seminole cultures, the religious, economic and linguistic cultures of the colonial Spanish in Columbia, the French in Haiti, the Dutch in Suriname, and the English in the United States?Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Smithsonian, perhaps our most prestigious educational institution, has never attempted to explore this comparative perspective of how our Nation came to be peopled. For whatever reason, the institution has failed to examine the college of relationships that shaped the values, attitudes, and behaviors of our various constituencies. Aside from occasional, temporary exhibits on a specific immigration or migration topic, such as the Museum of American History's recent exhibit on the northern migration of African-Americans, none of the Smithsonian's many museums and facilities has tasked itself to examine any aspect of this phenomenon, the peopling of America experience, much less offered a global review of the subject.This shortcoming derives, in part, from the fact that the Smithsonian, for all its reputation as a world-class research and educational organization, remains an institution rooted in 19th century intellectual taxonomy. For example, during the early years of the Smithsonian, the cultures of Northern and Western European Americans were originally represented at the Museum of Science and Industry, which eventually became the Museum of American History. However, African Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and others were treated ethnographically as part of the Museum of Natural History. This artificial bifurcation of our cultural patrimonies is still in place today. Consequently, the collections of various ethnic and cultural groups have been fragmented among various Smithsonian entities, making it difficult to view these groups in relation to each other or as part of a larger whole.The establishment of the Peopling of America Museum would address this glaring deficiency. The museum would instantly create a national venue where all Americans, regardless of ethnic origin, could visit in order to discover and celebrate their diverse historical roots. More important, the museum would facilitate an exploration of our commonalities, the historical and cultural experiences that created the unique American identity and sensibility.Mr. President, in May 1995, the Commission on the Future of the Smithsonian Institution, a blue ribbon panel charged with pondering the future of the 150-year-old institution, issued its final report. In its preface, the Commission noted:The Smithsonian Institution is the principal repository of the nation's collective memory and the nation's largest public cultural space. It is dedicated to preserving, understanding, and displaying the land we inhabit and the diversity and depth of American civilization in all its timbres and color. It holds in common for all Americans that set of beliefs--in the form of artifacts--about our past that, taken together, comprise our collective history and symbolize the ideals to which we aspire as a polity. The Smithsonian--with its 140 million objects, 16 museums and galleries, the national Zoo, and 29 million annual visits--has been, for a century and a half, a place of wonder, a magical place where Americans are reminded of how much we have in common.The story of America is the story of a plural nation. As epitomized by our nation's motto, America is a composite of peoples. Our vast country was inhabited by various cultures long before the Pilgrims arrived. Slaves and immigrants built a new nation from ``sea to shining sea,'' across mountains, plains, deserts and great rivers, all rich in diverse climates, animals, and plants. One of the Smithsonian's essential tasks is to make the history of our country come alive for each new generation of American children.We cannot even imagine an ``American'' culture that is not multiple in its roots and in its branches. In a world fissured by differences of ethnicity and religion, we must all learn to live without the age-old dream of purity--whether of bloodlines or cultural inheritance--and learn to find comfort, solace, and even fulfillment in the rough magic of the cultural mix. And it is the challenge to preserve and embody that marvelous mix--the multi-various mosaic that is our history, culture, land, and the people who have made it--that the Smithsonian Institution, on the eve of the twenty-first century, must rededicate itself.Mr. President, what more compelling argument in favor of the Peopling of America Museum can be found than in these words? What initiative other than the Peopling of America Museum would more directly address the Smithsonian's role in presenting the diversity and depth of American civilization in all its timbres and color, or making the history of our country come alive for each new generation of American children, or preserving the multivarious mosaic that is our history, culture, land, and the people who have made it?In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe that this initiative will foster a much-needed understanding of our diversity, of the rich cultural and historical differences that constitute our uniqueness as individuals. Conversely, and more important, I believe that the Peopling of America Museum will promote an appreciation of the common values, relationships, and experiences that bind our citizens together. A museum dedicated to the celebration of our unity in diversity will sustain and invigorate our sense of national purpose; surely this is a mission worthy of the Smithsonian to undertake.Thank you, Mr. President. I hope that this legislation will initiate a national dialog about the central role that the Smithsonian should play in preserving, researching, and exhibiting America's cultural and historical patrimony. I look forward to beginning this conversation with my colleagues, the academic community, and the interested public.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.",

    "text": "Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise today to honor the students, teachers, staff, administrators, parents, and supporters of Kaimuki Intermediate School from Kaimuki, O'hau for their achievement in receiving the prestigious Blue Ribbon Schools award. This year, Kaimuki Intermediate School was one of the schools selected from hundreds of secondary schools across the nation to receive this award. It is a reflection of the administration's, teachers', and staff's determination to provide an excellent educational environment for their students.The U.S. Department of Education presents the Blue Ribbon Schools award to schools that have excelled in leadership, community involvement, environmental awareness, and a continuous desire to overcome the barriers that impede a quality education. This award is one of the most prestigious educational awards in the nation. Schools that receive this recognition provide a challenging education for their students, strive to maintain a clean and healthy environment, develop and maintain family relations, and recruit and maintain high caliber teachers.Mr. President, it is no surprise that Kaimuki Intermediate School, which challenges students academically, has been chosen for such an honor. Students are given numerous opportunities to expand their interests and talents by participating in committees, including School Community Based Management (SCBM) and the Student Activities Council (SAC). These committees enable students to participate in the administrative process of their education and allow them to contribute ideas to improve school activities and develop ideas that could further benefit their education.The students at Kaimuki Intermediate School have had many accomplishments. One student traveled to Washington, D.C., to compete in the national math competition. The eighth grade girls basketball team won first place in their league, and other students participate in a wide range of activities like intermural and extramural sports, band, and math competitions. Indeed, Kaimuki Intermediate School has excelled in their effort to provide students with a well rounded education.Mr. President, I am proud to rise today to recognize everyone who has contributed to making this award a reality, and congratulate the faculty and staff and, most importantly, the students of Kaimuki Intermediate School for a job well done.

    "title": "NOMINATION OF SUSAN OKI MOLLWAY, OF HAWAII, TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF HAWAII",
    "text": "Madam President, it is with great pleasure that I take the floor today to speak on behalf of Ms. Susan Oki Mollway, the President's nominee to the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii.I wholeheartedly support Ms. Mollway, who, if confirmed, will fill the fourth seat on the Hawaii court. I also want to join with the remarks of my senior Senator, who eloquently and passionately spoke about Susan Oki Mollway and her family. He also spoke about our interviewing her for this position and how impressed we were with her caliber, the kind of person that she is. I also want to thank chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah for his support and for reporting this out of committee, and also Senator Pat Leahy, the ranking member from Vermont on the committee, and members of the committee for reporting this nominee out to the floor. I also want to thank our majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, for permitting it to be on the floor today.This has been a long journey for us. This position has been vacant since the untimely passing of Judge Harold Fong in April of 1995. As the senior Senator from Hawaii noted, the caseload in the District of Hawaii continues to increase. This has been very, very difficult for Hawaii. The recently adjusted 1997 Federal Court Management Statistics Report found that the U.S. District Court, District of Hawaii, is the eighth busiest court out of 91 in the country, and the third busiest in the ninth circuit.Therefore, it is critical that the vacancy on the Hawaii court is filled. Senator Inouye and I believe that Susan Oki Mollway is the most qualified candidate for this position.Ms. Mollway enjoys the highest rating of ``well qualified'' from the majority of the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. To quote some of her colleagues in Hawaii, ``We have come to know her as a highly ethical, careful, dedicated, intelligent, articulate, caring, and energetic lawyer.'' Ms. Mollway is known for her professional skills, her sense of ethics, and a moral compassion--qualities needed for service on the Federal bench.Senator Inouye has already recounted Ms. Mollway's education, professional, and family background. However, I do wish to point out that, as a Harvard Law School graduate, she could have stayed on the mainland like so many of Hawaii's young people. Instead, she returned to Hawaii, the home of her parents, where she joined one of Honolulu's best-known law firms --Cades Schutte Fleming &amp; Wright.As a specialist in civil litigation, Ms. Mollway handles a wide range of cases and has appeared before every level of the State and Federal courts, including a successful appearance before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1994.Ms. Mollway has responded fully to those who have questioned her on her former position on the board of directors of the Hawaii chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. Senator Inouye has mentioned this about her. Prior to her board membership, the ACLU-Hawaii filed a friend of the court brief in support of plaintiffs in the Hawaii same-sex marriage case. Although she was aware of ACLU-Hawaii's position and activities in the same-sex marriage case, as a board member Susan Mollway was never called on to play an active role.Furthermore, Ms. Mollway understands that her personal opinions are not relevant to the decisions she would make as a Federal judge. She has stated that she recognizes the authority of the Constitution, Federal statutes as passed by the Congress, and case precedent from higher courts as the judicial guidelines to follow in court deliberation.I believe my colleagues will agree with me that Susan Mollway's credentials are impressive. She is an individual of the highest integrity, whose dedication to her profession is admired by all. I am pleased to lend my support to Ms. Mollway and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this nominee whose confirmation will bring the U.S. District Court in Hawaii to its full complement.Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.",

    "text": "Mr. President, today I am introducing the Pet Protection and Safety Act of 1998, a bill to close a serious loophole in the Animal Welfare Act.Congress passed the Animal Welfare Act over 30 years ago to stop the mistreatment of animals and to prevent the sale of family pets for laboratory experiments. Despite the Animal Welfare Act's well-meaning intentions and the enforcement efforts of the Department of Agriculture, the Act routinely fails to provide pets and pet owners with reliable protection against the actions of USDA-licensed Class B animal dealers, also known as ``random source'' dealers.Medical research is an invaluable weapon in the battle against disease. New drugs and surgical techniques offer promise in the fight against AIDS, cancer, and a host of life-threatening diseases. Animal research has been, and continues to be, fundamental to advancements in medicine. I am not here to argue whether animals should or should not be used in research; rather, I am addressing the unethical practice of selling stolen pets and stray animals to research facilities.There are less than 40 ``random source'' animal dealers operating throughout the country who acquire tens of thousands of dogs and cats. Many of these animals are family pets, acquired by so-called ``bunchers'' who resort to theft and deception as they collect animals and sell them to Class B dealers. ``Bunchers'' often respond to ``free pet to a good home'' advertisements, tricking animal owners into giving away their pets by posing as someone interested in adopting the dog or cat. Random source dealers are known to keep hundreds of animals at a time in squalid conditions, providing them with little food or water. The mistreated animals often pass through several hands and across state lines before they are eventually sold by a random source dealer to a research laboratory for $200 to $500 each.Mr. President, the use of animals in research is subject to legitimate criticism because of the fraud, theft, and abuse that I have just described. Dr. Robert Whitney, former director of the Office of Animal Care and Use at the National Institutes of Health echoed this sentiment when he stated, ``The continued existence of these virtually unregulatable Class B dealers erodes the public confidence in our commitment to appropriate procurement, care, and use of animals in the important research to better the health of both humans and animals.'' While I doubt that laboratories intentionally seek out stolen or fraudulently obtained dogs and cats as research subjects, the fact remains that these animals end up in research laboratories--and little is being done to stop it. Mr. President, it is clear to most observers, including animal welfare organizations around the country, that this problem persists because of random source animal dealers.The Pet Protection and Safety Act strengthens the Animal Welfare Act by prohibiting the use of random source animal dealers as suppliers of dogs and cats to research laboratories. At the same time, The Pet Protection and Safety Act preserves the integrity of animal research by encouraging research laboratories to obtain animals from legitimate sources that comply with the Animal Welfare Act. Legitimate sources are USDA-licensed Class A dealers or breeders; municipal pounds that choose to release dogs and cats for research purposes; legitimate pet owners who want to donate their animals to research; and private and federal facilities that breed their own animals. These four sources are capable of supplying millions of animals for research, far more cats and dogs than are required by current laboratory demand. Furthermore, at least in the case of using municipal pounds, research laboratories could save money since pound animals cost only a few dollars compared to $200 and $500 per animal charged by random animal dealers. The National Institutes of Health, in an effort to curb abuse and deception, has already adopted policies against the acquisition of dogs and cats from random source dealers. By Mr. LEAHY:S. 2207. A bill to amend the Clayton Act to enhance the authority of the Attorney General to prevent certain mergers and acquisitions that would unreasonably limit competition; to the Committee on the Judiciary.Mr. President, I know that consumers are becoming more and more concerned about the merger mania that has hit the United States--they see the potential for higher prices to consumers and poorer service as industries become far more concentrated in fewer hands.I am also concerned about this trend, particularly when mergers take place between incumbent monopolies. Specifically, the mergers among Regional Bell Operating Companies, which continue to have a virtual strangle-hold on the local telephone loop, pose the greatest threat to healthy competition in the telecommunications industry.Indeed, incumbent telephone companies still control over 99% of the local residential telephone markets. In other words, new entrants have captured less than 1% of local residential phone service.The Telecommunications Act's promise of competition was a sales pitch that has not materialized to benefit American consumers. Instead of competition, we see entrenchment, mega-mergers, consolidation and the divvying up of markets. Even Edward Whitacre, Jr., the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SBC Communications, testified several weeks ago before the Antitrust Subcommittee that ``The Act promised competition that has not come.''At a recent judiciary committee hearing on mergers, Alan Greenspan acknowledged that the Act has not lived up to its promises of lower consumer costs and more competition.Since passage of this law, Southwestern Bell has merged with PacTel into SBC Corporation, and Bell Atlantic has merged with NYNEX. Now, SBC Corporation is seeking to purchase Ameritech. What once had been seven separate local monopolies will soon be four, with the possibility of more on the horizon. One of my home state newspapers--the Rutland Daily Herald--commented in an editorial that, ``It might even seem as if Ma Bell's corpse is coming back to life.''I voted against the Telecommunications Act because I did not believe it was sufficiently procompetitive. I raised a number of concerns as that Act was being considered by the Senate. I said in my floor statement on the day the new law passed:Mega-mergers between telecommunications giants, such as the rumored merger between NYNEX and Bell Atlantic, or the gigantic network mergers now underway, raise obvious concerns about concentrating control in a few gigantic companies of both the content and means of distributing the information and entertainment American consumers receive. Competition, not concentration, is the surest way to assure lower prices and greater choices for consumers. Rigorous oversight and enforcement by our antitrust agencies is more important than ever to insure that such mega-mergers do not harm consumers.I am very concerned that this concentration of ownership in the telecommunications industry is currently proceeding faster than the growth of competition. We are seeing old monopolies getting bigger and expanding their reach.Upon completion of all the proposed mergers among the Bell companies, most of the local telephone lines in the country will be concentrated in the hands of three to four companies. This will affect not only the millions of people who depend on the companies involved for both basic telephone service and increasingly for an array of advanced telecommunications services, but also competition in the entire industry. The Consumers Union recently testified before the Judiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee that the mergers between Regional Bell Operating Companies could lead to even more mega-mergers within this industry.I know personally that at my farm in Vermont and here at my office in the District of Columbia and at my home in Virginia, I still have only one choice for dial-tone and local telephone service. That ``choice'' is the Bell operating company or no service at all. The current mantra of the industry seems to be ``one-stop shopping.'' But if that stop is at a monopoly that is not competing on price and service, I do not think it is the kind of ``one-stop shopping'' consumers want.I have been concerned that the distraction of these huge mergers serve only to complicate and delay the companies' compliance with their obligations under the Telecommunications Act to open their networks. That is not good for competition in the local loop. Consolidation is taking precedence over competition. We need to reverse that priority, and make opening up the local loop the focus of the energies of the Bell Operating Companies. Then consolidation, if it happens, would not pose the current risk of creating additional barriers to effective competition.Big is not necessarily bad. But the Justice Department in the late 1970's worked overtime to divide up the old Ma Bell to assure more competition and provide customers with better service at lower rates. It is ironic that the Telecommunications Act, which was touted as the way to increase competition, is having the reverse effect instead of promoting consolidation among telephone companies.Before all the pieces of Ma Bell are put together again, Congress should revisit the Telecommunications Act. To ensure competition among Bell Operating Companies and long distance and other companies, as contemplated by passage of this law, we need clearer guidelines and better incentives. Specifically, we should ensure that Bell Operating Companies do not gain more concentrated control over huge percentages of the telephone access lines of this country through mergers, but only through robust competition.As the Consumers Union recently testified, ``If Congress really wants to bring broad-based competition to telecommunications markets, it must rewrite the Telecommunications Act, giving antitrust and regulatory authorities more tools to eliminate the most persistent pockets of telephone and cable monopoly power.''Today I am introducing antitrust legislation that will bar future mergers between Bell Operating Companies or GTE, unless the federal requirements for opening the local loop to competition have been satisfied in at least half of the access lines in each State. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this legislation to make the Telecommunications Act live up to some of its promise.The bill provides that a ``large local telephone company'' may not merge with another large local telephone company unless the Attorney General finds that the merger will promote competition for telephone exchange services and exchange access services. Also, before a merger can take place the Federal Communications Commission must find that each large local telephone company has for at least one-half of the access lines in each State served by such carrier, of which as least one-half are residential access lines, fully implemented the requirements of sections 251 and 252 of the Communications Act of 1934.The bill requires that each large local telephone company that wishes to merge with another must file an application with the Attorney General and the FCC. A review of these applications will be subject to the same time limits set under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.The bill also provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to modify, impair, or supersede the applicability of the antitrust laws of the United States, or any authority of the Federal Communications Commission, or any authority of the States with respect to mergers and acquisitions of large local telephone companies.The bill is effective on enactment and has no retroactive effect. It is enforceable by the Attorney General in federal district courts.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,This Act may be cited as the ``Antitrust Improvements Act of 1998''.The purpose of this Act is to enhance the authority of the Attorney General to prevent certain mergers and acquisitions that would unreasonably limit competition in the telecommunications industry in any case in which certain Federal requirements that would enhance competition are not met.The Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section:The Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section: ``SEC. 27. RESTRAINT OF TRADE REGARDING TELECOMMUNICATIONS.(a) In General.--Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this Act shall be construed to modify, impair, or supersede the applicability of the antitrust laws, or any authority of the Federal Communications Commission under the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.), with respect to mergers, acquisitions, and affiliations of large incumbent local exchange carriers. (b) Antitrust Laws Defined.--In this section, the term ``antitrust laws'' has the meaning given that term in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12).",

    "title": "DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999",
    "text": "I have offered an amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill to provide $12 million for electric and hybrid-electric vehicle development. The funds will be administered by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA. Senators Inouye, Jeffords, Leahy, Coats, and Boxer have joined me as cosponsors of the amendment.This is not a new program. Congress provided $115 million to the Department of Defense for the electric vehicle program over the past five fiscal years. Industry has contributed more than $115 million in matching funds. In fiscal year 1998, the appropriation was $15 million, so my amendment represents a budget reduction of 20 percent compared to the current fiscal year.Seven regional consortia, comprised of more than 200 member companies, participate in the program. Individual consortia, which were selected competitively, include Hawaii, Sacramento, the Mid Atlantic Consortium in Johnstown, PA, the Northeast Consortium in Boston, the Southern Consortium in Atlanta, the Mid America Consortium in Indianapolis, and CALSTART in Burbank, CA.The President's fiscal year 1999 budget proposed that the DARPA program be transferred to the Department of Energy and the Department of Transportation. The object of the fiscal year 1999 change was to transfer DoD-developed technology to commercial service vehicles such as buses, delivery vans, and service trucks. I support this transfer.Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of all three federal agencies and the consortia that participate in the electric vehicle program, another year of funding through the Department of Defense is needed before the transition can proceed.The Department of Defense has long been interested in hybrid electric combat vehicles because they can reduce fuel consumption by 50 percent, leading to a reduced fuel logistics burden, increased endurance, and reduced emissions. In addition, hybrid electric combat vehicles use electric power for mobility, weapons, countermeasures and sensors, and have reduced thermal and acoustic signatures.The five-year DARPA program has resulted in the development of a number of combat vehicles with hybrid electric propulsion. These include an Army M-113 Armored Personnel Carrier, a Bradley Fighting Vehicle, two High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles, commonly known as Humvees, and a prototype composite armored vehicle.Other DoD projects are in the planning stages. DARPA and the Marine Corps are jointly developing a hybrid-electric reconnaissance, surveillance and targeting vehicle, designed as a stealthy, fuel efficient vehicle that can be transported by the V-22 Osprey in support of the Marine Corps Sea Dragon operation. DARPA and the Army are jointly developing a combat hybrid power system for a 15-ton future combat vehicle. The system will provide pulse power for electric guns, directed energy weapons, and electromagnetic armor, as well as other components and systems.The funds provided by my amendment should be used in the same manner, and for the same program objectives, as in fiscal year 1998 funding. As the author of the amendment, it is my intention that DARPA administer the program as it did in fiscal year 1998, and that funds can be used for the development of defense and non-defense electric and hybrid-electric vehicles.I thank the Chairman, and my colleague from Hawaii, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee for their consideration of my amendment. I yield the floor.

    "text": "Mr. President, today Capitol Police Officer Jacob J. Chestnut was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery, concluding a week that has saddened and shocked every American and touched the hearts of millions of people around the world. I rise to express my profound sorrow over the death of Officer Chestnut and Detective John Gibson, and to extend my sympathy to the families, friends, and fellow officers of these two brave men. The tremendous outpouring of grief and respect we have experienced and witnessed during the Congressional ceremony and honors on Tuesday, and in the requiem services for Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut over the past two days are fitting tribute to the courage and selfless sacrifice of these fallen heroes.The deaths of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson, killed in the line of duty as they defended all of us who are privileged to work and visit the Capitol, is a testament to the fidelity and valor of these men, as well as a reminder of the exceptional bravery and courage of the men and women of the Capitol Police who protect the Capitol complex and grounds. We are fortunate to have these officers on the job, protecting all of us, willing to confront the dangers and violence that too often afflict our world today, so that our Capitol can remain open and accessible to the public. The professionalism, pride, and good-natured courtesy which these officers bring to their duties, day in and day out, serves our democracy by keeping the Capitol open to the people and safeguarding, with their lives if necessary, the freedom and liberty we cherish.On the Capitol dome, looking across the Capital City, stands the Statue of Freedom Triumphant in War and Peace, an emblem of democracy and hope, a symbol of America's promise that every citizen has the freedom and opportunity to realize their God given potential. In her right hand Freedom holds an olive branch, in her left, a sword, a reminder that the preservation of freedom and democracy often requires sacrifice.Over the course of our history, the Capitol has witnessed stirring oratory and the passage of landmark legislation which have inspired us, strengthened our nation, restored hope, preserved our Republic, and maintained our resolve. The heroic actions of Officer Chestnut and Officer Gibson, who acted to preserve and protect life without regard to their own safety, bonds deeds to the ideals and values we celebrate and honor here at the heart of our democracy. The President said it best when he stated that the actions of these brave men sanctified the Capitol. May God bring comfort and peace to the families, friends, and colleagues of Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut.",

    "title": "HIGHER EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1998--CONFERENCE REPORT",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report to H.R. 6, the Higher Education Reauthorization Act. Passage of this important measure will ensure that access to higher education remains attainable for all Americans.The increase in the Pell Grant eligibility included in the bill will help families and students offset the growing cost of higher education. This successful program has helped ensure that low-income and disadvantaged students have the opportunity to pursue a post-secondary education.The bill also includes the continuation of the concept of the State Student Incentive Grants (SSIGs). The new modified program, Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership Program, will continue the worthwhile effort of encouraging additional financial opportunities for students seeking a higher education.The decrease in the student loan interest rate is another effort to ensure that students and their families are able to obtain a quality higher education. The decrease in the student loan interest rate helps students reduce the financial burden of higher education. Too often students are forced to chose between their education and the enormous financial hardship they must overcome to obtain the education they need to improve their lives. The agreement included in the bill helps to reduce the financial burden for students and their families.Mr. President, the provisions in the bill relating to teacher development and preparation are important to ensure that we have the quantity and quality of teachers needed for the next generation of students. Across the country the shortage of teachers, particularly in critical subjects such as special education, math and science where there is serious demand, is having an adverse impact on our students. However, the problem is not just recruiting students to become teachers, the problem is making sure that students have the support and encouragement once they have chosen this honorable profession. Teacher development and preparation programs are essential if we are to stem the tide of teachers leaving the profession before retirement. Too many teachers are leaving to seek employment opportunities outside of the teaching profession because administrators and communities are failing to provide the support they need. The teacher development and preparation programs included in the bill will help to address this important issue.Ensuring that our teachers obtain the educational background needed to achieve academic success must start at higher education institutions. Colleges and universities should not complain about the caliber of students pursuing higher education, while denying their educational degree programs the resources and the support that they need. The caliber of teachers leaving these institutions has a direct impact on the quality of students coming through the front door. The provisions in this bill help to address these concerns.Mr. President, I would like to thank the Chairman, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Kennedy, the Ranking Member, for their support on resolving the eligibility concerns surrounding the students from the Federated Associated States (FAS). The House, unfortunately, attempted to terminate the eligibility of college students from FAS for Pell Grants, Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants, and College Work Study. The House provision would have upset the unique relationship the United States has with the FAS and violated the legal and moral obligation we have with the countries under the U.S. Compact of Free Association with the Republic of Palau and the U.S. Compact of Free Association with the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. It would have been an embarrassment if the U.S. failed to live up to its moral obligations in ensuring that FAS citizens were given the educational assistance necessary to become self-governing. The agreement worked out in conference ensures continued federal financial aid eligibility for FAS students and does not preclude the inclusion of such eligibility in the renegotiation of the Compact with the FAS.Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to express my support for this important measure and look forward to its passage. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.",

    "title": "HELP OUR STUDENTS LEARN",
    "text": "Mr. President, yesterday I stood with the President and several of my Democratic colleagues to call on the Republican leadership to focus their attention on the children of America. Millions of American children in schools across the United States are being denied the basic education foundation they need to succeed.In Hawaii, thousands of children waited with anticipation for the new school year. Parents took their children to buy school supplies, new clothes, and other back-to-school preparations. However, many of these students entered or returned to schools that are so inadequate that they cannot receive a quality education. Our children are being asked to learn in environments that are not conducive to learning, and may even be dangerous. But still, these young, bright-eyed, captivated children go day-after-day to schools seeking to learn the wonders of the world.Mr. President, Congress has the moral responsibility to ensure that we provide our children access to quality education. President Clinton recently called on Congress to enact several education initiatives that will improve education facilities, ensure that the education curriculum challenges and engages our students, and provide teachers and administrators the resources they need to teach and support our children.These proposals work together to strengthen our nation's schools. First, we need to build and modernize our nation's schools. We continue to demand that our workforce compete in the demanding high technology marketplace, yet we educate children in schools that do not have access to the information superhighway, let alone the physical capabilities to support the demand for access. Many of Hawaii's schools were built over 50 years ago, before schools required a computer in every classroom. For example, I recently received a e-mail from a concerned parent whose child attends Hickam Elementary School. The parents had decided to hold a teachers' breakfast for the faculty at the school. They turned on the air conditioning in the office and the library and blew the fuses--the electrical wiring was unable to handle the demand for the increased energy required by the air conditioners. If the wiring cannot support air conditioners, how can it support the computers and the air conditioners needed to cool the rooms which house the computers? Although Hawaii is facing economic problems, we are not facing these problems alone. Every day 14 million students attend schools that need extensive repair and replacement, like Hickam Elementary School. Almost 60 percent of America's schools reported at least one major building feature in disrepair.As we continue to rely on technological advances to improve education for our children, schools need to be capable of supporting these increasing demands. Hickam is not the only school in Hawaii experiencing this hardship; many schools in Hawaii face this problem. Administrators must choose whether to cool the library so that children can read and learn, or turn on the computers in their labs. This should not be. We need to assist schools in making the investments to improve existing facilities or allow them to build new facilities to meet the growing technological demands. We must commit ourselves to ensuring that our children are able to learn in a comfortable and safe environment. That is why I support efforts to rebuild, modernize, and reduce overcrowding in more than 5,000 public schools through Federal support that would pay the interest on nearly $22 billion in bonds to help improve the schools across the country, including Hawaii.But a new school loaded with technology gizmos is not enough. Ensuring access to such advancements does not guarantee success. We must also invest in our teachers. We chide teachers for being unqualified, but we fail to provide them the support needed to succeed. We lament the teacher shortage, but fail to provide the resources to recruit quality individuals. And, we have a growing problem with teacher retention, yet we fail to give teachers the respect they deserve and acknowledge that teaching is a very complex and difficult profession.As my colleagues know, before I came to Congress, I was a teacher. I taught elementary, intermediate, and high school students in Hawaii. I know, firsthand, the difficulties teachers face each day in their classroom. Fortunately, I taught during a time when teachers were respected and appreciated. Today, however, we take teachers for granted. We expect them to be teachers, counselors, and sometimes, even part-time parents. We fail to recognize the importance these individuals have in shaping the nature of our nation's future leaders. I am not sure when this terrible decline began, but I know that it must stop. We must raise our respect for teachers and realize that they are not the source of our education problems, nor are they the only ones that can improve our current situation.We have a responsibility to provide the resources needed to allow our nation's teachers to succeed. We need to increase funding for teacher development programs such as technology teacher training, which helps teachers learn to use technology effectively to improve classroom instruction and enhance student learning. We need to help communities hire 100,000 new qualified teachers to allow schools to reduce there class sizes. We need to reduce the number of out-of-field teachers, particularly for new teachers who are more often assigned to teach subjects outside of their field of training and often do not have the support and mentoring to assist in their development. The First Lady said, ``it takes a village to raise a child.'' I believe that, but I also believe that it takes a village to teach a child. Teachers, parents, administrators, and communities as a whole must be committed to ensuring that our children are provided the assistance they need to obtain a quality education.Children are wonderful, forthright, and open individuals, particularly when they are young. It is always a treat for me to meet with young students, they often have a very truthful and direct way of putting things into perspective. Just three weeks ago, I participated in a satellite conference with third grade students from Queen Liliuokalani Elementary School and high school students from Radford and Kaimuki High Schools. The high school students are participants in E-school, a virtual school which provides on-line and satellite distance learning opportunities to students and teachers. Hawaii's Department of Education is a national leader in the virtual school concept. Leveraging federal funding through the Technology Literacy Fund and the Technology Challenge Grants, Hawaii students are able to learn and receive over 21 high school credit courses for on-line classes. Yet, even with these wonderful achievements in Hawaii, more needs to be done. The students who participated shared with me their concerns over the lack of more capable computers, the need for greater security for the system, and the desire for more teachers who are able to use the system. Students want to learn, it is our responsibility to ensure that they have the resources available to help them achieve their goals.We know that children learn better in small classes, particularly in the early childhood years, study after study has proven that class size makes a difference in the achievements of our children. President Clinton has requested $12 billion over 7 years to reduce the class size in grades 1 to 3. As a former teacher, I strongly believe that the proposal would significantly advance the educational achievements of our students. The average class size in the United States for grades 1 to 3 is 23. In Hawaii, the average class size for kindergarten through third grade is 21.9. How can we expect our children to be able to learn when one teacher is required to teach 21 five- to eight-year-olds. I challenge my colleagues to spend a day, just one day, at a elementary school in their State to experience firsthand the challenges in getting 21 five through eight-year-olds to pay attention to you.Our responsibility should not stop with the school bell. As many as 5 million children are home alone after school each week. Hawaii was fortunate to have the first state-wide after-school care program. This innovative program began in 1990 under the leadership of Governor Benjamin Cayetano while he was the Lieutenant Governor. Hawaii's A-Plus program provides after-school activities to eligible students in grades K through 6. The program provides supervised enrichment and physical development activities at 171 public schools. It is available to eligible children and fees are based on a sliding scale from $6 to $55 per month.However, many of our children in other states are not as fortunate. Only one-third of the schools in low-income neighborhood and half the schools in affluent areas offer after-school programs. Full funding for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program would provide 400,000 children in the United States access to safe learning centers, similar to those provided in Hawaii.First-rate facilities, quality teachers, students ready and willing to learn are important ingredients needed to ensure success for our children, but that success also needs to be based on high academic standards. We must set significant academic standards for our students to ensure that they will be able to compete in the growing global economy. We should increase funding for Goals 2000 to assist states in raising and setting academic standards that challenge and motivate students. We need to expand funding for Title I to provide the means for disadvantaged communities to develop and maintain high academic standards.Mr. President, our schools are in disrepair, our classrooms are overcrowded, our teachers are overburdened, our children need our help now. We have a responsibility and a moral obligation to provide modern, safe facilities, reduce class sizes, provide the support for children outside of the classrooms, and support and help recruit and retain well-qualified teachers. I urge my Senate colleagues to make a concerted effort to address this vital national problem. The implications of ignoring or delaying our obligation may have ramifications that may not be so easily corrected.Our nation's children are depending upon us to make the sacrifice and do what needs to be done. We must stand up and meet this challenge, if we do not, we will have failed our nation's children--our nation's future.",

    "title": "REAUTHORIZATION OF THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT",
    "text": "Mr. President, for the last year or so, both the House and Senate have been working on legislation that would reauthorize the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has reported legislation offered by my colleague from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, that would modify the Act in significant ways. Although it is unlikely that we will take up this bill in the short time remaining to us, I would like to make a few observations about the Endangered Species Act and what it has meant to Hawaii, home to more endangered species than any other state or territory within the United States.Mr. President, as legislators, we are guardians of our Nation's rich natural inheritance; in this capacity, we cannot afford to squander the ecological legacy we leave to our children. Surely, part of our concern for rare species and ecosystems is the simple realization that once they are gone, we would have failed in our stewardship responsibility. Hawaii is poised on the brink of irreversible ecological change, and it is important that wise stewardship decisions be rendered to preserve our unique, tropical ecosystem.The term ``ecosystem'' has become a political buzzword and does not adequately described the delicate checks and balances that make up the natural world. The basis of Hawaii's natural system begins not with a list of threatened plants and animals, but with the unique origin of the islands. For millions of years, lava welling out from the earth's mantle cooled upon the ocean floor, gradually forming the Hawaiian islands, one by one, a process that is ongoing even today. As one island moves away from the influence of a ``hot spot'' in the middle of the Pacific, another island is born. Each island is the peak of a volcanic mountain, with its base hidden far below the surface of the ocean. Only a few types of birds, insects, and plants were able to colonize the remote islands, and these few evolved into scores or even hundreds of unique species. The islands sheltered no large land mammals or reptiles, only creatures that have gradually lost their natural defenses against such predators.The Endangered Species Act is critical to this unique, insular ecosystem. There are, 1,126 total U.S. species listed by Fish and Wildlife Service under protection of the ESA, and although its islands represent just two-tenths of one percent of the total U.S. land area, Hawaii is home to more rare and endangered species than any other state or territory. In addition, three-fourths of the nation's now extinct plants and birds once existed only in Hawaii. Hawaii has an astounding 363 listed endangered species. Only California, with 223 listed species, rivals Hawaii in the number of listed endangered species. The Pacific islands, not including Hawaii, have a total of 16 listed endangered species.The causes of Hawaiian species decline are numerous and complicated, but the most significant threats come from non-native animals that uproot and devour fragile native plants. Feral pigs, rats, and mongooses not only physicially destroy plants, but spread the seeds of aggressive alien plants such as the South American banana poke vine, and small invasive trees like the Brazilian strawberry guava. These alien plants form thick, impenetrable monocultures that choke out native plants. When native plants disappear, the birds and insects that rely on native plants for food are also threatened. Diseases that kill native flora and fauna are also spread by alien species: birds in particular are ravaged by diseases transmitted through mosquitoes.Hawaiian plants and animals co-evolved over millions of years and continue to depend on each other for survival. The interdependency of Hawaiian insects, birds, and plants makes this ecosystem susceptible to rapid, irreversible change due to loss of species richness. Endangered species in Hawaii range from mammals such as the charismatic monk seal and the Hawaiian goose (also the state bird), or nene [nay-nay], to sea creatures like the hawksbill sea turtle and invertebrates such as the Oahu tree snail. There are endangered plants from 279 taxa, including plants with great cultural significance such as the mahoe and uhiuhi. Hawaii harbors at least 5,000 species as yet unknown to science as well as many rare species, including the wekiu bug, which has ``antifreeze'' in its blood, and the Wood's tree hibiscus, a small tree previously unknown to science, found in Kauai, with only four individuals known worldwide.I cannot stress enough that the loss of even one species may contribute to the decline of entire ecosystems, and barring unprecedented action, many species may vanish undiscovered. Along with the species, lost also is genetic information that could lead to new foods and medicines.Mr. President, the survival of hundreds of endangered species now depends on human intervention. Though gravely threatened, Hawaii's remaining natural treasures can be saved. Conservation of habitat, control and eradication of noxious introduced plants and predators, and enlightened resource management are the answer. Conservationists within Hawaii kill feral animals, erect fences to keep ungulates away from fragile plants, breed animals in captivity, pollinate flowers by hand, and destroy alien plants. We are hoping to restore and maintain healthy ecosystems so that Hawaii's native species have the respite and protection they need to survive. Thus, Hawaii is not a lost cause: more than a quarter of the state's land remains unspoiled. But we must continue in our struggle to protect rare and endangered species before the battle is over and our legacy to our children is robbed of species richness.Since the enactment of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, we have garnered important knowledge and won substantial victories across the country in our efforts to protect imperiled species. Eight U.S. species have removed from the list due to recovery and another 18 species have been upgraded from endangered to threatened. More importantly, at least half of all species listed for a decade or more are not either stable or improving in status.For example, the first group of captive-bred Mexican wolves was released back into the American southwest this year; California condors, southeastern fish, and dear to me, the Hawaiian silversword plant and `alala have also been re-introduced to the wild. Bird conservation groups in my own state have hatched eggs from 12 different endemic species--species that have never before been reared in captivity like the `akohekohe, palila, Maui parrotbill, puaiohi, `elepaio, and `amakihi. All of this has been accomplished in 25 years since the Act's passage--remarkable when considered on nature's time scale rather than our fast paced Congressional calendar.But these successful conservation efforts are not merely a result of Federal law. In Hawaii at least, the State legislature has enacted an endangered species law that is comparable, and, in some instances, stronger than Federal law. Last year, the State amended this law to allow ``take'' of endangered or threatened species when such authorization is issued in conjunction with a safe harbor agreement or habitat conservation plan. Although modelled after Federal law, the State amendments are more strict. For example, under the ESA, in order to allow for a ``take,'' the population must not decrease; however, under the Hawaiian statute, the likelihood of population increase must be proven before taking is allowed.Despite success on the Federal and State levels to protect and preserve biological diversity, Congress may next year consider legislation similar to the Kempthorne bill, that in its current form could weaken the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Nation's most important law protecting endangered wildlife and wildlife habitat.There are many provisions of the Kempthorne bill, S. 1180, the Endangered Species Recovery Act of 1997, that I applaud and support. The bill emphasizes recovery efforts, and codifies many of the administration's efforts to provide incentives to landowners that are affected by the Endangered Species Act. The Kempthorne bill also expands the role of States in implementing the act, which has the potential to tailor species recovery efforts on a case-by-case basis, rather than applying a Federal cookie-cutter approach to species protection.However, there are key elements of S. 1180 that are fundamentally unsound. For example, the legislation would lock in Habitat Conservation Plans without allowing for review and adjustment. Mr. President, our knowledge of rare species is slow in coming; but as our information base grows, Habitat Conservation Plans need to change and grow, too, reflecting new and more complete information about the needs of endangered species. Imagine if our knowledge or medical science were similarly locked in--we would still be using leeches to bleed patients of ``humors.''In addition, the Kempthorne measure does not fully cover water rights, nor does it provide just compensation to property owners. It would also establish significant bureaucratic obstacles to listing, management, and recovery plans. And it offers less conservation per dollar appropriated.Our House colleague, Congressman George Miller, has put forward a bill that I find more consistent with the original intent of the Endangered Species Act. The Miller bill emphasizes recovery of species; steps up protection of candidate species; creates a new and important category of ``survival habitat'' which is designated at time of listing, yet also has a version of ``no surprises'' permits; and creates a habitat conservation fund based on performance bonds paid by recipients of incidental take permits. It contains extensive tax benefits for landowners affected by the Endangered Species Act. Most importantly, under the Miller legislation, the public is allowed to sue to enforce the terms of Habitat Conservation Plans.I applaud Senator Kempthorne for attempting in his legislation to balance the needs of private landowners against the protections we accord endangered species; unfortunately, I believe his bill tilts too far in favor of the former. However well-meaning, key provisions of the bill represent a backtracking on endangered species and endangered species habitat protection. Until these shortcomings are addressed, Congress should not consider altering the most important and effective law we have on the books for protecting our rarest forms of life.Mr. President, let me conclude by noting that more than any other state, Hawaii is teetering on the edge of no return. The Endangered Species Act is our ultimate safety net when the more than 150 other U.S. laws and international treaties fail to prevent a species from declining toward extinction. When measured in terms of preventing threatened species from going extinct, the Act has been an overwhelming success. I would be reluctant to support legislation, however well-intentioned, that would reduce the effectiveness of this landmark law.I therefore look forward to debating reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act when the 106th Congress convenes. Senator Kempthorne and Congressman Miller have both made good starts in heightening concern about endangered species and in bringing to light the complexities of species protection and recovery. Let us build on their efforts next year and debate more thoroughly the requirements that are necessary to crafting a stronger, more effective endangered species law.I yield the floor.",

    "text": "Mr. President, today I am introducing the Downed Animal Protection Act, a bill to eliminate inhumane and improper treatment of downed animals at stockyards. The legislation prohibits the sale or transfer of downed animals unless they have been humanely euthanized.Downed animals are severely distressed recumbent animals that are too sick to rise or move on their own. Once an animal becomes immobile, it must remain where it has fallen, often without receiving the most basic assistance. Downed animals that survive the stockyard are slaughtered for human consumption.These animals are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to handle humanely. They have very demanding needs, and must be fed and watered individually. The suffering of downed animals is so severe that the only humane solution to their plight is immediate euthanasia.Mr. President, the bill I introduce today requires that these hopelessly sick and injured animals be euthanized by humane methods that rapidly an effectively render animals insensitive to pain. Humane euthanasia of downed animals will limit animal suffering and will encourage the livestock industry to concentrate on improved management and handling practices to avoid this problem.Downed animals compromise a tiny fraction, less than one-tenth of one percent, of animals at stockyards. Banning their sale or transfer would cause no economic hardship. The Downed Animal Protection Act will prompt stockyards to refuse crippled and distressed animals, and will make the prevention of downed animals a priority for the livestock industry. The bill will reinforce the industry's commitment to humane handling of animals.The problem of downed animals has been addressed by major livestock organizations such as the United Stockyards Corp., the Minnesota Livestock Marketing Association, the National Pork Producers Council, the Colorado Cattlemen's Association, and the Independent Cattlemen's Association of Texas. All of these organizations have taken strong stands against improper treatment of animals by adopting ``no-downer'' policies. I want to commend these and other organizations, as well as responsible and conscientious livestock producers throughout the country, for their efforts to end an appalling problem that erodes consumer confidence.Despite a strong consensus within industry, the animal welfare movement, consumers, and government that downed animals should not be sent to stockyards, this sad problem continues, causing animal suffering and an erosion of public confidence in the industry.Mr. President, this legislation will complement industry effort to address this problem by encouraging better care of animals at farms and ranches. Animals with impaired mobility will receive better treatment in order to prevent them from becoming incapacitated. The bill will remove the incentive for sending downed animals to stockyards in the hope of receiving some salvage value for the animals and would encourage greater care during loading and transport. The bill will also discourage improper breeding practices that account for most downed animals.My legislation would set a uniform national standard, thereby removing any unfair advantages that might result from differing standards throughout the industry. Furthermore, no additional bureaucracy will be needed as a consequence of my bill because inspectors of the Packers and Stockyards Administration regularly visit stockyards to enforce existing regulations. Thus, the additional burden on the agency and stockyard operators will be insignificant. By Mr. THOMAS:S. 516.

    "title": "EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to express my concern on the FY 1999 emergency supplemental and rescissions bill. I support disaster relief for Central America and the Caribbean, emergency relief for America's farmers in crisis, and aid to Jordan to implement the Wye River agreement. It is important that these priorities be funded.My concern is that one of the budget offsets to pay for this bill pits these important foreign and domestic needs against the needs of the country's poorest families--something that Hawaii's poorest families can ill afford. This supplemental bill seeks to defer $350 million in funding from ``unobligated balances'' under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Program until fiscal year 2001. The language in the bill requires deferral of portions of states' unobligated TANF funds.The deferral is based on the states' share of total unobligated funds. Preliminary estimates show this means Hawaii would not be able to spend about $800,000 of its TANF funds until fiscal year 2001.It is my understanding that my friend from Alaska, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, is working to find a different offset so that the $350 million in TANF funds will not have to be deferred. I strongly encourage him in these efforts and urge that this be done.In the meantime, we all know that TANF replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children welfare program in 1996. I am a critic of the TANF Program for failing to provide an adequate safety net for low-income families. However, I am adamant that full funding must continue to go to the states to assist welfare families and their children. No part of it should be deferred to offset supplemental spending.The term ``unobligated,'' may seem self-explanatory. Anyone may think that a $350 million deferral of unobligated funds under the bill would apply to funds that have simply not been spent under this program. Proponents would argue that welfare rolls have fallen so far that this money is not needed by states, which is why it remains unobligated. However, Mr. President, we know that funding decisions by state and local governments take time. Transfers of expenditures must go through a process. States often commit funding to counties and local governments that is not transferred immediately, so the amount is not taken off the states' books.The fact is many states rely heavily on these unobligated funds and have already committed them for a wide variety of uses, such as distribution to counties and local agencies, ``rainy day'' funds for contingencies such as economic downturns that swell the rolls and leave states without enough money until the next federal payment, transfers into child care and social services activities, or other basic expenses to help low-income families become self-sufficient.My state of Hawaii continues to plan uses for all available funds to provide child care services to our TANF families so that they can be given a chance to continue at their jobs and make it work. Hawaii is doing this the right way, instead of simply looking at the numbers and acting to drop welfare recipients off their rolls. Hawaii is truly ``teaching them to fish,'' so that they truly achieve self sufficiency.Deferring release of TANF funds for a number of years and using the $350 million for emergency spending violates the agreement made when TANF was passed. I have a letter here from Governor of Hawaii, Benjamin Cayetano, dated March 12th, that describes the agreement between Governors, Congress, and the administration that the entitlement nature of the old AFDC Program would be replaced with a set amount of funding to states under TANF. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.",

It also opens more resources to Native Americans, the homeless, those with disabilities or substance abuse problems, and victims of domestic violence. This is similar to a proposal unveiled by the Clinton Administration earlier this year and introduced as H.R. 1482 by Representative Benjamin Cardin of Maryland.

    "text": "Mr. President, I quote from that letter to me.President Clinton and I believe the Welfare-to-Work Grants Program is a key component of the overall welfare reform efforts.Mr. President, the Welfare-to-Work program has helped numerous welfare parents--both custodial and non-custodial--find and keep jobs that pay a living wage and allow them to fulfill basic obligations to their children. Children have fundamental needs for food, shelter, and clothing, yet many parents find themselves barely scraping by, in order to obtain these things. Many families are unable to go much beyond the essentials to enroll their children in sports and other activities that build strong bodies and social skills, or to provide them with decent school supplies, books or computers to develop strong minds. Most families take these things for granted because they live without the anxiety of wondering when the next paycheck or child support payment might be coming in. They have the finances to pay for child care to enable parents to work during the day. They have cars or other access to transportation that will take them to work every morning. Or they have a telephone so that they may receive calls for job interviews. The families that cannot make ends meet continue to live in dire need and find their children living at risk.Mr. President, 14.5 million American children live in poverty. Furthermore, as reported in Kids Count 1999, 32 percent of children do not live with two parents and 19 percent live in a home where the head of household is a high school dropout. Twenty-one percent of children are in families with incomes below the poverty line, 28 percent are living with a parent or parents lacking steady full-time employment, and 15 percent do not have health insurance. It is a shame that, in the most prosperous nation in the world, we continue to be faced with these dismal statistics for our children--young Americans who hold the promise of this country's future in their hands.Many of these children were helped when the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created the Welfare-to-Work program as a new system for providing assistance to welfare recipients most in need. This followed on the heels of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children cash assistance program with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.The 1996 welfare reform law addressed the bulk of the welfare population but lacked a component to help the hardest to employ welfare recipients. Thus, Welfare-to-Work was passed to assist this population find jobs and achieve independence so they no longer would need public support. The Welfare-to-Work program became an essential component of the Administration's welfare reform effort by providing recipients with a good alternative to welfare.Since 1996, the number of people in the system dropped by a record number: forty percent from a peak of about five million families in 1994 down to three million families as of June, 1998, according to the General Accounting Office. However, the job is not finished. Welfare-to-Work is needed now more than ever because those remaining on the rolls are increasing likely to have multiple barriers to employment such as poor work experience, inadequate English or computer skills, or substance abuse problems.We need to invest much more to help these individuals reach self-sufficiency than we did in those who have already left welfare-these individuals might have already had an educational record, special skills or significant family support behind them to help them to their feet. In contrast, Welfare-to-Work participants are the welfare recipients who need the most help. In addition, extending Welfare-to-Work will become even more important when TANF recipients and their children reach welfare time limits in 19 states by year's end and have their benefits reduced or completely removed.These are the hard luck cases, Mr. President. These are the people who continue to be left out of the economic boom of the 1990s. And these are the people whom Welfare-to-Work was designed to help. If we let the program expire this year, even if states have three years from the date of award to spend their program funds, we will be saying to these people, ``We've forgotten the promises we made to you in 1996 that we would continue to help you. Now, there is no more help for you.''This would be particularly harmful in my state of Hawaii which has struggled due to the Asian financial crisis and has been the only state where welfare rolls have increased. Welfare-to-Work has assisted many of Hawaii's welfare recipients through this period of financial hardship for the state by helping them find unsubsidized employment. The program must be extended so that it may help other recipients and their families in my beleaguered state.My bill not only extends the Welfare-to-Work program, but it also makes a number of important improvements to the program that states, counties, and cities have requested. Currently, most funds allocated to Welfare-to-Work state formula grants cannot be used because of eligibility criteria that are difficult to meet. Currently, an individual must have been receiving assistance for at least 30 months or must be within 12 months of reaching the maximum period for assistance. In addition, they must have two of three characteristics, including: lacks a high school diploma or GED and has low math or reading skills; has a poor work history; or requires substance abuse treatment for employment. These criteria have excluded many TANF applicants who, for instance, may have a GED or high school diploma but still cannot read; these criteria have proven unrealistic.Instead, under my bill, criteria would be changed to require participants to have one out of seven characteristics: lacks a high school diploma or GED; has English reading writing, or computer skills at or below the 8th grade level; has a poor work history; requires substance abuse treatment for employment; is homeless; has a disability; or is a victim of domestic violence. This revision in eligibility criteria would allow the program to better match the participant pool. It is necessary because current criteria have left more than 90 percent of Welfare-to-Work state formula grants unspent. In Hawaii alone, only 37 percent of our TANF recipients have been eligible to participate in the program, and this figure would double under my bill. Furthermore, officials of the Hawaii Department of Human Services which administers TANF and Welfare-to-Work in my state predict that unless the Federal law is changed, it is unlikely that they will be able to refer clients in sufficient numbers to meet WtW expectations. Similar situations exist in all states, and these criteria revisions respond to State and local entities that have been doing the work of Welfare-to-Work and want to serve as many participants as possible. In Texas, 21,000 people would be able to participate in the program, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Under my bill, figures like this could be seen across the nation, and more people in need would be able to find employment.A related improvement contained in my bill is that it transfers any unallocated Welfare-to-Work formula grant funds into the competitive grant program. This competitive grant program has been tremendously popular.Out of the 1400 applications submitted requesting a total of $5 billion, only 126 applications for $470 million in funds were awarded in FY 1998. This portion of Welfare-to-Work needs more funding. Under my bill, preference is given to grant applications submitted from states that did not receive a formula grant.Mr. President, my bill also provides a re-emphasis on the whole family. This past Father's Day, I had the opportunity to celebrate with several of my children and their families, as it was a day to celebrate and honor the family. However, many fathers were not as fortunate as myself and were not able to celebrate with their children because they went through divorce and did not receive custody of the children. Even worse, many of these fathers are dismissively labeled ``dead beat dads'' because they are not a presence in their children's lives and do not pay child support. What we have found, Mr. President, is that many of these fathers do not want to abandon their children. Rather, they are ``dead broke dads'' and face the same barriers to finding and holding employment that many welfare mothers do. This prevents them from fulfilling child support obligations, which many want to do. If these fathers can provide for their children, they will be more likely to see them more often. Hopefully, renewed financial and emotional involvement of fathers will mean that these children's lives will improve.For these non-custodial fathers, my bill will make it easier for them to participate in Welfare-to-Work. Currently, non-custodial parents face the same problems in attempting to qualify for Welfare-to-Work as other applicants because of the same overly-restrictive criteria. Under my bill, the eligibility requirements for non-custodial parents will be revised to allow them to demonstrate that they are unemployed, underemployed, or having difficulty paying child support payments. In addition, at least one of the following characteristics must apply to the minor child or non-custodial parent: the child or non-custodial parent has been on public assistance for over 30 months, or is within 12 months of becoming ineligible for TANF due to a time limit; the child is receiving or eligible for TANF; the child has left TANF within the past year; or the child is receiving or is eligible for food stamps, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicaid, or the Children's Health Improvement Program (CHIP).The bill increases funding for non-custodial parents by requiring that at least 20 percent of state formula funds be used for this population. The bill also provides that a non-custodial parent will enter into an individual responsibility contract with the service provider and state agency to say that he or she will cooperate in the establishment of paternity and in the establishment or modification of a child support order, make regular child support payments, and find and hold a job. These revisions are an attempt to permit and encourage non-custodial parents to provide for their children, become more involved in their children's lives, and pursue better lives for themselves and their families.Mr. President, Native American communities will benefit from my bill from a doubling of the Native American set-aside from $15 million to $30 million. This funding increase in necessary because Native Americans currently receive one percent of the total Welfare-to-Work funds but serve 3.2 percent of total program participants, according to a recent U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Welfare-to-Work Evaluation. In recognition of their sovereignty, the bill also provides Native American tribes with flexibility in designing programs that are effective for their territories. It is a gross understatement to say that our Native American communities have not had the chance to experience the economic success that our nation has been enjoying. We must do what we can to make up for this shortfall, fulfill our Federal responsibilities to Native Americans, and help families and children in Native American communities who face obstacles to self-sufficiency.Mr. President, children who leave foster care at age 18 make up another hard-to-help population that faces numerous barriers to employment. My bill introduces new support for these individuals when they attempt to start out on their own by allowing them to take advantage of Welfare-to-Work programs. According to DOL, 20,000 children leave foster care annually. Of these, 32 to 40 percent receive some type of government assistance within the first 18 months after leaving the foster care system. This bill provides funds to help them find alternatives to welfare as they leave their state care system.My bill simplifies Welfare-to-Work reporting requirements so that the program can be evaluated effectively. This evaluation will allow Congress and DOL access to better statistics on how the program is performing nationwide. In addition, one-percent of the funds are provided for technical assistance so that DOL can ensure cooperation between states, local governments, TANF and child support agencies, and community-based organizations so that all are able to work together and be better able to provide services to those who are in need.Finally, the bill eases Welfare-to-Work's ``work first'' requirements that mean that TANF recipients must find jobs first, before they are able to take advantage of stand-alone programs such as job training, basic education or vocational education programs. My bill would designate these as allowable work activities under Welfare-to-Work. This change is in response to requests from states who want to use program funds to better prepare recipients for the workforce before sending them off to a job. This approach seeks to improve TANF recipients' chances at maintaining steady employment.Although my colleagues may have disagreed on welfare reform in the past, Welfare-to-Work is a program that all should be able to support. It represents a Federal-state-local partnership, as well as a partnership between government, private industry, and community-based organizations. It encourages people to take responsibility for themselves, find work, and contribute to their families and society in a meaningful way. We cannot abandon these welfare recipients who are the most difficult to employ and must instead invest in them in a way that will help them find jobs paying a living wage, become self-sufficient, and allow them to break out of the cycle of dependency on public assistance.I would again like to thank my colleagues Senators Moynihan, Feinstein, Wellstone, Murray, and Lautenberg for joining me as original cosponsors of my bill, and I urge other colleagues to join us in supporting this important Welfare-to-Work reauthorization bill.

    "text": "I join my colleague, Senator Landrieu, in introducing legislation to reauthorize the Historic Preservation Fund and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. As my colleagues may know, the authorization for the Historic Preservation Fund expired on September 30, 1997, and the authorization for the Advisory Council expires on September 30, 2000. This bill would reauthorize the fund and the Council through fiscal year 2005.There is a growing backlog of preservation needs throughout our country that is not being met. To ensure that this situation is not exacerbated, and to address these shortfalls on a long-term basis, the Historic Preservation Fund should be reauthorized at the earliest opportunity.The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 was amended in 1976 to establish the Historic Preservation Fund. Administered by the National Park Service, the Fund provides grants-in-aid to States, certified local governments, and outlying areas. The National Historic Preservation Act provides that $150 million from Outer Continental shelf oil and gas receipts is deposited in the Fund each year. The revenue remains available in the Fund until appropriated by Congress. Since September 30, 1997, no additional deposits from OCS revenues into the Fund have been authorized.Reauthorization of the Historic Preservation Fund is critical because it provides for the continuation of grants used by States, Tribes, Native Hawaiians, Alaska Natives, and local governments to pay the costs of surveys, comprehensive historic preservation plans, National Register nominations, brochures and educational materials, as well as architectural plans, historic structure reports, and engineering studies necessary to repair listed properties.Since 1968, over $800 million in grant funds has been awarded to 59 States, territories, local governments, Native Hawaiian organizations, Indian tribes, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In Fiscal Year 1998, the States received a total of $29.4 million in historic preservation grants-in-aid, an average allocation of $524,000, which typically is matched by $350,000 in non-federal matching share contributions.During 1998, States surveyed 14.9 million acres of historic resources and added 185,100 properties to their inventories. Also in 1998, States submitted 1,602 nominations to the National Register of Historic Places and reviewed 89,000 Federal projects for compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. In Hawaii, over 38,000 properties are maintained on the state's inventory of known historic properties.Besides providing grants-in-aid, the Historic Preservation Fund also administers a grant program for Native Hawaiians, Indian Tribes, and Alaska Natives for cultural heritage programs. The Tribal Preservation Program has directly assisted over 170 tribes through the award of 259 grants.For example, the Hopi Tribe in Arizona received a grant to document the rock art sites at Antelope Mesa, resulting in 100 sites being included in their Cultural Resources Management Plan. In Alaska, the Native Village of Venetie drafted a historic preservation plan for Venetie and Arctic Village utilizing a grant from the Historic Preservation Fund. The Seneca Nation of Indians in New York used a grant to develop educational materials for their school children using oral interviews with tribal elders.In all, more than $9 million in grant funds has been used to assist tribes in assuming State Historic Preservation Office responsibilities, in drafting preservation ordinances, implementing cultural resource management plans, identifying and protecting historic sites, and conducting preservation needs assessments.In addition, the Fund provides matching grants to Historically Black Colleges and Universities to preserve threatened historic buildings located on their campuses. Funding for preservation projects has been used at Fisk University and Knoxville College in Tennessee; Miles College, Talladega College, Selma University, Stillman College, Concordia College in Alabama; Allen University, Claflin College, Voorhees College in South Carolina; and Rust College and Tougaloo University in Mississippi.In addition to the Historic Preservation Fund, Congress created the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. As an independent federal agency, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, the Council is the major policy advisor to the Federal government on historic preservation. The Council administers programs including, but not limited to, the Historic Preservation Fund, the National Register, and programs of the National Trust. The Council also reviews the policies of Federal agencies in implementing the National Historic Preservation Act, conducts training and educational programs, and encourages public participation in historic preservation. The Council's authorization expires in Fiscal Year 2000.The Council's role in working with Federal agencies to support the National Historic Preservation Act is essential for protecting this country's historical resources. The Council coordinates many different preservation programs. The Council works with the Housing and Urban Development's HOME program for affordable housing, promotes preservation of historic properties during natural disasters, and promotes preservation and reuse of historic properties during military base closures. The Council, working with State and local governments through State Historic Preservation Officers, has significantly enhanced our ability to preserve our national heritage. Both the Historic Preservation Fund and the Advisory Council contribute to ongoing Federal, Native Hawaiian, Tribal, State, local and private partnerships in historic preservation. Matching funds are contributed by the States and local and private partners to enhance the investment in our historic heritage. Federal and State funding for historic preservation creates jobs, promotes economic development, and helps leverage commitments from private and public sources.Historic sites in our country are tangible reminders of our diverse and rich heritage and provide us with a sense of continuity with our past. The Historic Preservation Fund has provided numerous opportunities for preserving our country's irreplaceable historic and archeological resources. For example, in Hawaii, preservation projects in the Oahu Market in Chinatown and at the Mission Houses were funded through Historic Preservation Fund grants. Similarly, New Hampshire used preservation funding to assist with the transformation of the 1925 Goffstown High School into an apartment complex for the town's older inhabitants. The Alaska Gold Rush Centennial was developed as a heritage tourism initiative of the Alaska State Historic Preservation Office using historic preservation funds to establish State-community partnerships. Also, the Save America's Treasures program funded by the Historic Preservation Fund has provided grants for preservation projects of national scope and significance, including restoration of the Star-Spangled Banner and the Declaration of Independence.A similar bill introduced by the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu) passed the Senate last year by unanimous consent but was not acted on by the House. I hope that the legislation we are offering today--a simple reauthorization of the Fund and Council through 2005--can be adopted expeditiously.This legislation is supported by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, the National Alliance of Statewide Preservation Organizations, the National Coordinating Committee for the Promotion of History, Preservation Action, the Society for American Archaeology, and the American Historical Association. I urge my colleagues to support this measure as well. By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. Kerry):S. 1435.

    "text": "Mr. President, I rise, while we are debating the budget reconciliation bill, to talk about an important family issue that I raised during debate on the emergency supplemental bill in March. I want to voice my strong opposition to efforts by Members in the other body to use $6 billion in unspent welfare and health care funds, intended for low-income children and their families, as a gimmick to overcome their problem with this year's low budget caps.Mr. President, I am referring to attempts to rescind $6 billion in unobligated Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF money, and unobligated Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Plan funds. I learned of this proposal after reading the July 28, 1999, New York Times, in which appeared a story entitled, ``Leaders in House Covet States' Unspent Welfare Money.'' Why do they want to do this? To help fund the $792 billion tax cut proposal that the other body passed last week--a proposal that would mostly help the wealthy in our nation. Any such action would be a repudiation of our promise to help families living in poverty. It is a classic situation of reverse Robin Hood: robbing the poor to give more to the rich.Mr. President, during debate on the welfare reform bill in 1996, states agreed to trade entitlement status under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program for the assurance of a fixed, annual amount in the form of a block grant. Those of us who opposed the welfare bill for this and other reasons warned that it would be harder under a block grant to keep welfare funds from being cut. Now, certain members are turning our fears into reality. The cuts in this former entitlement program have begun. Cutting funds in this manner, Mr. President, would represent a betrayal of our promise to protect America's poor families.Again, as I explained in March, the term, ``unobligated,'' may seem self-explanatory--that these are simply funds that have not been spent under TANF, Medicaid, or CHIP. Under TANF, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, a combined total of $4.2 billion from fiscal years 1997, 1998 and 1999 is available. Some would point out that many poor families have worked their way to self-sufficiency and that welfare rolls have fallen by record numbers, as reasons why this money is not needed by states and remains unobligated.However, many states are relying heavily on these unobligated funds and have already committed them for a wide variety of uses. States need to distribute some of this funding to counties and local agencies, or to child care and social services activities. Governors are keeping ``rainy day'' funds for contingencies such as recessions or periods of stagnant growth--as we have now in my State of Hawaii--that force families back onto welfare and leave states without enough money until the next quarterly federal payment. States are also planning to use this money for fundamental or new, innovative expenses to help poor families become financially independent.In July 23, the National Governors Association wrote to Congressmen John Porter and David Obey of the House Appropriations Committee, to plead their case. This letter is signed by Governors Thomas R. Carper of Delaware and Michael O. Leavitt of Utah, one Democrat and one Republican. The letter states, ``Cutting funding for vital health and human services programs such as Medicaid, CHIP, TANF, and child support would adversely affect millions of Americans--with the greatest impact on children and the elderly in the greatest need. We reiterate our adamant and uniform opposition to these unprecedented cuts and to any proposal that would result in such drastic cuts to our most vulnerable citizens.''I concur with the Governors' sentiments about these valuable programs.Mr. President, I do this especially because the monies in question were originally designated to help our poorest children and their families. Instead, they would, over the next 10 years, go toward such things as estate tax relief and capital gains tax relief--tax benefits for the wealthiest taxpayers in the Nation.Tax relief can be a good thing. However, it should not be the top priority when we face the urgent need to pay down our country's debt and save Social Security and Medicare. I hope my colleagues agree with me on an issue that is important to many poor Americans. I hope funding is not taken out of TANF, Medicaid or CHIP, as a solution to low budget caps.",

    "text": "Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of S. Con. Res. 53, a sense of Congress resolution relating to the recent allegations of espionage and illegal campaign financing that have brought into question the loyalty of individuals of Asian Pacific ancestry.Mr. President, I am concerned about the negative impact that the recent investigation of Wen Ho Lee, a scientist at Los Alamos, New Mexico, is having on the Chinese American community. Certain recent media coverage of this investigation has chosen to portray Chinese and Chinese Americans with a broad brush, using loaded words that are offensive and implying that certain people should be treated with suspicion solely because of their ethnicity or national origin. Cartoons exaggerate and poke fun at physical appearances of individuals by depicting slanted eyes and buck teeth.In one particularly offensive example, a recent editorial in a Santa Fe, New Mexico, newspaper made fun of Asian accents, unnecessarily referred to the ``Fu Manchu'' character, and tried to link the allegations of stolen nuclear secrets and the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.Mr. President, Asian Pacific Americans are an important part of our body politic. They have made significant contributions to politics, business, industry, science, sports, education, and the arts. Men and women like the late Senator Sparky Matsunaga, Olympic Champion Kristi Yamaguchi, Architect I.M. Pei, Maxine Hong Kingston, Ellison Onizuka, and many others have enhanced and invigorated the life of this nation.Asian Americans have played a fundamental part in making this country what it is today. Asian immigrants helped build the great transcontinental railroads of the 19th century. They labored on the sugar plantations of Hawaii, on the vegetable and fruit farms of California, and in the gold mines of the West. They were at the forefront of the agricultural labor movement, especially in the sugarcane and grape fields, and were instrumental in developing the fishing and salmon canning industries of the Pacific Northwest. They were importers, merchants, grocers, clerks, tailors, and gardeners. They manned the assembly lines during America's Industrial Revolution. They opened laundries, restaurants, and vegetable markets. They also served our nation in war: the famed all-Nisei 100th/442nd combat team of World War II remains the most decorated unit in U.S. military history. Despite their contributions, Asian immigrants and Asian Pacific Americans suffered social prejudice and economic, political, and institutional discrimination. They were excluded from churches, barber shops, and restaurants. They were forced to sit in the balconies of movie theaters and the back seats of buses. They attended segregated schools. They were even denied burial in white cemeteries; in one instance, a decorated Asian American soldier killed in action was refused burial in his hometown cemetery. Rather than receive equal treatment, Asians and Pacific Islanders were historically paid lower wages than their white counterparts, relegated to menial jobs, or forced to turn to businesses and industries in which competition with whites was minimized.For more than 160 years, Asians were also denied citizenship by a law that prevented them from naturalizing, a law that remained in effect until 1952. Without citizenship, Asians could not vote, and thus could not seek remedies through the Tammany Halls or other political organizations like other immigrant groups. The legacy of this injustice is seen today in the relative lack of political influence and representation of Asian Americans at every level and in every branch of government.Mr. President, as a member of the Energy Committee and governmental Affairs Committee, where I am Ranking Member on the International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services Subcommittee, I have expressed my concern about the unfair and unwarranted negative impact this issue is having on the image of the Asian Pacific American community. We need to move quickly beyond the search for ethnic scapegoats. This is the lesson of the recent concern over national security leaks. We should not overreact.Mr. President, I applaud President Clinton's executive order of June 7, 1999, to establish a commission to study and suggest ways to improve the quality of life for Asian Pacific Americans. President Clinton rightfully stated that many Asian Pacific Americans are underserved by federal programs. The order outlines steps to ensure that federal programs, especially those that gather data on health and social services, are responsible to Asian Pacific Americans needs. It's a step in the right direction and it may focus on some of the more compelling issues involving Asian Pacific Americans in terms of improving the quality of their lives. ",

    "title": "PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK 2000",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today during Public Service Recognition Week 2000 to encourage my colleagues to take a moment to honor the many selfless actions and outstanding accomplishments of our nation's state, local, and Federal public servants. As the ranking member on the Senate Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services, with direct jurisdiction over the Federal civil service, I take particular pride in honoring the millions of dedicated men and women who work around the clock on our behalf.Their responsibilities are as varied as the challenges presented by their jobs. Our armed forces and civilian defense workers keep us out of harms's way--both domestically and abroad--our public school teachers instruct our children, and the U.S. Postal Service provides delivery to every address in the nation. Our public servants safeguard our food supplies; support our social services infrastructure, oversee and protect our economy; and so much more. These men and women are the backbone of what makes America great. We often take them for granted and in certain instances subject them to scorn and ridicule. With little recognition from the public they serve, these employees are unwavering in their dedication, honor, purpose, and ability to serve their cities, counties, states, and Federal Government.I am heartened that so many school districts are fostering public service by requiring their students to serve as volunteers prior to graduating high school. As a former school teacher and administrator, I believe that voluntary service is useful and appropriate in developing a sense of community and fellowship, and I am hopeful that as each generation matures it will see the value of continuing their public service by working in state, local, or Federal Government. However, I am aware that Congress must play a role in supporting public service.At a Governmental Affairs Committee hearing this week on the effectiveness of Federal employee incentive programs it became evident that the lack of sufficient funds to support viable and much-needed compensation, recognition, and incentives program for Federal employees was hampering efforts to recruit, retain, and relocate Federal workers.Federal agencies, if given adequate funding, would be better positioned to utilize incentive programs that are already available. Flattened budgets and the pressure to reallocate limited resources do not benefit Federal employees or the ultimate end-user: the American taxpayer.Our Nation's Federal civil servants have given much to their country, especially when Congress was balancing the budget during times of crunching deficits. Now that the country is enjoying record-breaking surpluses, I believe Federal employees should be rewarded for their contributions, and I will continue to push for realistic budgets and salaries for Federal agencies and their employees.I proudly join all public service workers in observance of the 16th annual Public Service Recognition Week, and I heartily salute the past accomplishments, outstanding service, and future contribution that these outstanding men and women make to our Nation's greatness.",

    "title": "ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today with deep admiration and praise for an integral presence within America's diverse society--Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Every May, during Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, we commemorate the major contributions made by this small, but by no means insignificant part of the U.S. population.Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, both in the aggregate and in groups of distinct and unique ethnic origin, comprise a growing force in our citizenry. Whether their ancestry is Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Indian, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Laotian, Hmong, or other Asian American, or Native Hawaiian, Chamorro, Samoan, Micronesian, Tongan, Fijian, or other Pacific Islander American, they are a vibrant part of our society. If one could see numbers about each of the distinct peoples in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, they would observe that we make up one of the fastest growing segments of the population. Our reach in communities across America is increasing. Asian Pacific Americans should not be thought of as located only in a few select states such as Hawaii or California. We have migrated over time from various points of origin in the U.S. to all parts of the country and have come to contribute to local business, education, and politics in every state.Nearly 11 million Asian and Pacific Islanders lived in the U.S. in about 2.5 million families, according to last year's estimates. About four-fifths of these families were headed by married couples. Furthermore, the Census Bureau projects that the Asian and Pacific Islander population will more than triple to nearly 38 million by the middle of this new century, climbing from four to nine percent of the American population. This growth in the number of Asian Pacific Americans will be felt across the country, and more light will be shed on the multifaceted strengths and varied needs of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.President Clinton recognized the importance of increasing awareness about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders when he signed Executive Order 13125 in June, 1999. The Executive Order established the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders with the goal of improving the quality of life for this population by increasing their participation in Federal programs. Such programs include those related to health, human services, housing, education, labor, transportation, economic development, and community development programs--encompassing those which currently serve this population and those which may not have served this population in the past.I am happy to say that the Initiative is marching onward through high-level, interagency meetings involving all major agencies in the Executive Branch, and the establishment of the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The Commission will be sworn in later this week and includes 15 members representing various interests and diverse segments of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. It will be chaired by an esteemed colleague, former Congressman Norman Mineta, and will include representatives such as Haunani Apoliona from my State of Hawaii. I hope that now and in the next Administration, the Initiative and the Commission will continue to work hand-in-hand toward: increased research and data collection; private sector, public sector and community involvement; and, development, monitoring, and coordination of Federal efforts toward improved quality of life for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.There is clear evidence to show that this type of Federal attention is needed. As stated in the Presidential Proclamation for Asian Pacific American Heritage Month 2000, despite many successes, the needs in the community still continue to be great:While many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders today are thriving, others are still struggling to overcome obstacles. Because of oppression in their countries of origin, some new immigrants have arrived without having completed their education; once here, some have encountered language and cultural barriers and discrimination. Pacific Islanders, too, must overcome barriers to opportunity caused by their geographic isolation and the consequences of Western influences on their unique culture. For these and other reasons, too many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders face low-paying jobs, inadequate health care, and lack of educational opportunity.The Initiative, Advisory Commission, and the Asian American and Pacific Islander community have much work to do in these areas. I urge that the proper resources and attention continue to flow to support this combined effort.Mr. President, within this Federal effort, I cannot underscore enough how much we need to focus on improving data collection for the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. The tremendous diversity in the community poses challenges that have produced data and statistics that are inadequate. Most data collection tends to lump the various Asian American and Pacific Islander ethnicities together in a single category, swallowing up numbers for each distinct group and failing to present an accurate picture of the services needed.For example, the respected organization, the College Board, produced a report regarding minority achievement in higher education. The report failed to include Asian Pacific Americans because we were considered to be over-represented in higher education. Unfortunately, in the making of the report, differences between individual groups within the community were ignored. For example, higher educational attainment is greater for groups like Japanese and Chinese Americans than it is for American Samoan and Southeast Asian Americans. Statistics such as these must be brought to light so that educational agencies and institutions know to which groups they should target their limited resources. Thankfully, Congressman Robert Underwood, the Chairman of the Congressional Asian Pacific Caucus, worked to counter this problem and, in the end, reached an agreement with The College Board to work together and analyze disaggregared data for the population.As another example of data collection challenges, I have worked on Office of Management and Budget Statistical Policy Directive No. 15, which governs the racial and ethnic data collection by Federal agencies. In 1993, I began efforts to change the Directive so that Native Hawaiians would be disaggregated from the Asian Pacific Islander category. My main concern was that Native Hawaiians, as an indigenous people were being classified with populations that had immigrated to the U.S., thereby creating the misperception that Native Hawaiians were immigrants rather than the indigenous peoples of Hawaii.I finally succeeded in 1997, when OMB Policy and Statistical Directive No. 15 was revised. Native Hawaiians were disaggregated from the Asian Pacific Islander category and a new category entitled, ``Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders'' was created. That was one step toward fixing inaccuracies in data collection. Agencies have until January 1, 2003 to make all existing recordkeeping or reporting requirements consistent with its standards. However, provisions of the revised directive took effect immediately for all new and revised recordkeeping or reporting requirements that include racial and/or ethnic information. It is my understanding that only the Department to Health and Human Services has established a policy with respect to the requirements of OMB Directive 15. I have encouraged all Federal agencies to actively work to implement this Directive, especially in collaborative efforts with the White House Initiative and President's Advisory Commission.As a further example, on March 14, 2000, I hosted a forum to discuss Census 2000 and its impact on Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in Honolulu. The forum included panel members from the Federal government, Congress, and Native Hawaiian, Samoan, and Chamorro community organizations. The issue which generated the most concern regarding Census 2000 was the application of multiracial reporting. This issue is one of particular sensitivity in Hawaii, where a large percentage of the population has multiethnic backgrounds.In Hawaii, it is very common for individuals, when asked for their ethnicity, to list their entire ethnic background. Only when asked which ethnicity the individual most identifies with will the individual limit the answer to one ethnic background. Furthermore, it was revealed through forum discussion that there is no resolution as to how data will be reported for those who check off more than one race on the 2000 Census form. This raises the fear that the final counts of various Pacific Islander populations--such as the Native Hawaiian population--where multiple-race backgrounds are common, would be inaccurate. Statisticians verify that this has enormous effect on smaller populations.I am continuing to work on this problem because of the tremendous impact that Federal data has in its use in deciding funding and participation in thousands of Federal, state and local programs. Inaccurate data means that many individuals will not be served, and we must do what we can to prevent this from happening. We must work on these and other issues facing the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, just as we do for issues facing our country's other populations, because it is part of our responsibility to keep each part of our diverse America as strong as it can be.Mr. President, I recently introduced related legislation that would allow us to take a broader look at, and emphasize the heterogeneous nature of, America. S. 2478, or the Peopling of America Theme Study Act of 2000, takes pride in America's diversity by authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to identify regions, areas, districts, structures and cultures that illustrate and commemorate key events or decisions in the peopling of this country. I hope that this effort will provide a basis for the preservation and interpretation of the complex movement of people, ideas, and cultures to and across the American continent that resulted in the peopling of the nation, and the development of our unique, pluralist society--one that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are fully a part.The bill encourages development of preservation and education strategies to capture elements of our national culture and history such as immigration, migration, ethnicity, family, gender, health, neighborhood, and community. The prehistory and the history of this nation are inextricably linked to the mosaic of migrations, immigrations and cultures that has resulted in the peopling of America. Americans are all travelers from other regions, continents and islands, and I feel we need a better understanding and appreciation of this coherent and unifying theme in America. This is the source of our nation's greatness and strength. Our rich American heritage includes the traditions, cultures, and contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, both as a group and as individuals.Mr. President, I would like to conclude my statement with a note of praise and congratulations to some of the members of the Asian Pacific American community most deserving of recognition. President Clinton recently approved the Army nominations of 21 Asian Pacific American World War II veterans to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor. This concluded a review that I requested of service records of Asian American and Pacific Islanders who received the Distinguished Service Cross during World War II. The approval of the Medal of Honor for these 21 men who served with valor in World War II--19 from the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and 100th Infantry Battalion--is long overdue recognition of the heroic service and bravery displayed by these Asian American soldiers and their comrades in arms. As we honor these patriots, including my colleague Senator Daniel Inouye, let us also remember the thousands of young men, living and deceased, whose courage, sacrifice and spirit proved that patriotism is a circumstance of the heart, not a consequence of the skin.The 100th/442nd fought with incredible courage and bravery in Italy and France. Its members won 1 Medal of Honor, 53 DSCs, and more than 9,000 Purple Hearts. The unit itself won 8 Presidential Unit Citations. The fact that the 100th/442nd saw such fierce and heavy combat, yet received only one Medal of Honor award, and then only posthumously and due to congressional intervention, raised serious questions about the fairness of the award process at that time. Unfortunately, Asian Pacific Americans were not accorded full consideration for the Medal of Honor at the time of their service. A prevailing climate of racial prejudice against Asian Pacific Americans during World War II precluded this basic fairness, the most egregious example being the internment of 120,000 Japanese Americans. The bias, discrimination, and hysteria of that time unfortunately has an impact on the decision to award the military's highest honor to Asians and Pacific Islanders.I commend Secretary Caldera and all the Army personnel who conducted the DSC review in a thorough and professional manner. They carried out the difficult task of identifying and reconstructing the records of more than one hundred veterans with diligence, sensitivity, and dispatch. The stories documented for each of the 104 DSC recipients will astonish and humble all who read them and underscore our faith in a nation that produces such heroes.As the only Chinese American in this body and the sole Native Hawaiian in the Congress, I am proud of the legacy that we as Americans are leaving for the world. I am proud of our great country, and I am proud of the citizens that make our country great--including our nation's Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. We have much to celebrate during Asian Pacific Heritage Month 2000.Mr. President, thank you again for this opportunity, and I yield the floor.",

    "title": "CARL ``BOBO'' OLSON INDUCTED INTO INTERNATIONAL BOXING HALL OF FAME",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to honor Carl ``Bobo'' Olson, the legendary world boxing champion born and nurtured in Hawaii, who was inducted yesterday into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, New York. This is certainly a well-deserved honor for ``The Hawaiian Swede,'' a distinguished champion whose life and 16-year professional career represent the grit, tenacity, skill and love of sport that have made boxing popular worldwide.Born in 1928, Bobo Olson grew up quickly on the tough streets of downtown Honolulu in the early 1940s, sharpening his boxing skills at an early age. Bobo and I grew up in the same community, the Pauoa and Punchbowl area in Honolulu--a neighborhood where families of different races, many of Hawaiian or Portuguese heritage--lived side-by-side and shared our cultures and traditions. We all closely followed Bobo's rise to champion and took pride in a local boy who had reached the top in his sport and handled his success with humility and grace.He began fighting professionally at age 16, and won 19 fights before he reached the age where he could legally box on the mainland circuit. As a professional, Bobo won the World Middleweight Championship by defeating Randy Turpin of England in October 1953 before 18,869 spectators in a 15-round fight at New York's Madison Square Garden. Ring Magazine named him fighter of the year in 1953. He held the title for two years; losing it in 1955 to Sugar Ray Robinson.Olson's career record was 117 fights, 99 wins, 49 by knockout, 16 losses and two draws. Four of those losses were to Ray Robinson, who is considered by many boxing experts and fans to be the greatest middleweight ever and among boxing's all-time greats. Bobo Olson held the middleweight title longer than any other boxer in the 1950s and fought as a middleweight and light-heavyweight. He never shied away from a challenge. Bobo was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1958, and was also among the first class of athletes, sportsmen and sportswomen inducted into the Hawaii Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. After retiring from boxing in 1966, Bobo worked as recreational director for the Operating Engineers Local Union in San Francisco and in public relations for the Teamsters. Now happily retired, he and his wife Judy reside in Honolulu.Mr. President, I join boxing enthusiasts and the people of Hawaii in congratulating Carl ``Bobo'' Olson on his induction into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. He remains a soft-spoken champion, and his quiet intensity and commitment to excellence offer a lasting illustration of good sportsmanship for all of us. ",

    "title": "TRIBUTE TO ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN MEDAL OF HONOR WINNERS",
    "text": "Mr. President, I stand here today to pay tribute to the 22 men who received the Medal of Honor yesterday. As has been indicated by a number of my colleagues, one of those recipients is my dear friend and colleague from Hawaii, Senator Daniel K. Inouye. I extend my heartfelt congratulations to:Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Second Lieutenant, 442nd Regimental Combat Team;Rudolph Davila, Staff Sergeant, 3rd Army;Barney Hajiro, Private First Class, 442nd RCT;Mikio Hasemoto, Private, 100th Battalion;Joe Hayashi, Private First Class, 442nd RCT;Shizuya Hayashi, Private, 100th Battalion;Yeiki Kobashigawa, Technical Sergeant, 100th Battalion;Robert Kuroda, Staff Sergeant, 442nd RCT;Kaoru Moto, Private First Class, 100th Battalion;Kiyoshi Muranaga, Private First Class, 442nd RCT;Masato Nakae, Private First Class, 100th Battalion;Sinyei Nakamine, Private, 100th Battalion;William Nakamura, Private First Class, 442nd RCT;Joe Nishimoto, Private, 442nd RCT;Allan Ohata, Staff Sergeant, 100th Battalion;James Okubo, Technical Sergeant, 442nd RCT;Yukio Okutsu, Technical Sergeant, 442nd RCT;Frank Ono, Private First Class, 442nd RCT;Kazuo Otani, Staff Sergeant, 442nd RCT;George Sakato, Private, 442nd RCT;Ted Tanouye, Technical Sergeant, 442nd RCT;Francis Wai, Captain, 34th Division.Mr. President, these 22 Medal of Honor recipients have joined an elite group of soldiers honored for exceptional valor in service to our country. It may have taken half a century, but the passage of time has not diminished the magnificence of their courage. These 22 men truly represent the best that America has to offer. They answered the call to duty and proved that patriotism is solely a circumstance of the heart. These men answered the call of duty with conviction and courage, at a time when these virtues were most in demand by a needy Nation. In the face of discrimination and injustice at home, these men set aside personal consideration to defend our great Nation on foreign battlefields. By their actions, these 22 men proved that patriotism is not based on the color of one's skin, but on the courage and strength of one's convictions.I am pleased to have contributed to the process that finally led to the appropriate recognition of these soldiers. Legislation initiated by the Senate required the military to review the records of all Asian Pacific American recipients of the Navy Cross or Distinguished Service Cross during World War II to determine if any merit upgrade to the Medal of Honor.Many times I have been asked why I thought review was necessary. The review provision was offered and adopted out of concern that Asian Pacific American veterans have never been fully recognized for their military contributions during the Second World War.Many in Hawaii know of the exploits of the 100th Infantry Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat Team. It came as a surprise that few on the mainland were familiar with the service of this famous all-Nisei, second generation Japanese unit, or of the secret Military Intelligence Service whose members served in the Pacific.Twenty of the twenty two Medal of Honor recipients honored yesterday and today are from the 100th Infantry Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Of the remaining two recipients, Sergeant Francis Davila served with the 7th Infantry and Captain Francis Wai served with the 34th Division.Few people realize the history of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. On December 7, 1941, during the attack on Pearl Harbor, a call went out for all University of Hawaii ROTC members to report for duty. These students, most of whom were Americans of Japanese ancestry, responded to the call and were fully prepared to defend the United States. 370 of the Japanese American ROTC cadets were sworn into the Hawaii Territorial Guard and guarded the most sensitive and important installations in Hawaii.Due to the shock at the attack on Pearl Harbor and an unfortunate ignorance by some of the culture and racial makeup of the citizens of Hawaii, there were individuals who opposed Japanese Americans serving in the Territorial Guard. The 370 Japanese Americans who had served faithfully, willingly, and patriotically during the weeks following Pearl Harbor, were dismissed from the Territorial Guard because of their ancestry. Instead of rebelling, resigning, or protesting, these men wrote to the Commanding General of the Hawaiian Department and stated their ``willingness to do their part as loyal Americans in every way'' and offered themselves for ``whatever you may see fit to use us.''These men formed the Varsity Victory Volunteers and worked at the quarries, constructed roads, helped construct warehouses, renovated quarters, strung barbed wire, and built chairs, tables, and lamps. They even donated blood and bought bonds. We cannot forget that these men were students and could have been making money in white collar jobs.Instead, they devoted their time to doing what they could to help the military. It was this group of Japanese American volunteers, the Varsity Victory Volunteers, who were eventually given the authorization by the War Department to form the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, which would earn the distinction as the ``most decorated unit for its size and length of service in the history of the United States.''Their motto, ``Go for Broke,'' is a perfect description of their spirit and character as men and as a fighting unit. The 442nd and 100th Battalion captured enemy positions and rescued comrades. They completed missions that seemed impossible. Ignoring danger, they repeatedly placed themselves in harm's way, gaining a reputation for fearless and fierce fighting. Throughout the Army their bravery earned them the nickname the ``Purple Heart Battalion.''In 1943, when the War Department decided to accept Nisei volunteers, over 1,000 Hawaii Nisei volunteered on the first day. The spirit and attitude of these volunteers is captured in the senior Senator from Hawaii's memoir, ``Journey to Washington.''I want to read an excerpt from the book describing an exchange between young Dan Inouye and his father as he left to report for induction.After a long period of silence between us, he said unexpectedly, ``You know what `on' means?'' ``Yes,'' I replied. On is at the very heart of Japanese culture. On requires that when one man is aided by another, he incurs a debt that is never canceled, one that must be repaid at every opportunity. ``The Inouyes have great on for America,'' my father said. ``It has been good to us. And now it is you who must try to return the goodness. You are my first son, and you are very precious to your mother and me, but you must do what must be done.''Mr. President, for over 60 years, my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Hawaii, has returned to America the goodness and service to honor his father's admonition. On the field of battle in Italy, in the territorial legislature, and for over 40 years in Congress, Dan Inouye has served his country with distinction and courage. His leadership on national defense, civil rights, and a host of other issues have made America a stronger and better country. I am proud to serve with him in the United States Senate.Mr. President, the people of Hawaii are also very proud that 12 of the 22 men awarded the Medal of Honor are from Hawaii.My Honolulu office received a call the other day from a constituent in Waianae, a small community on the leeward coast of Oahu, who wanted to make sure that people knew that three Medal of Honor recipients were from Waianae.Indeed, the people of Hawaii are proud and grateful for all the local boys who have served in defense of our nation. They are well aware of the sacrifice and hardship endured by our men in uniform during World War II and subsequent conflicts.Out of the 22 men honored, 10 were killed in battle. Five of the recipients survived World War II, but have passed on prior to knowing that their medals were upgraded. That leaves us with seven living recipients, five of whom, I am proud to say, are from the State of Hawaii.I see this as an opportunity to inform the American public about the degree and level of participation of Asian Pacific Americans in the war effort. I thank President Clinton, Secretary of Defense William Cohen, and Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera for the painstaking and thorough manner in which the review and nomination process was conducted. I commend Secretary Caldera and all the Army personnel who conducted this review in a thorough and professional manner. They carried out the difficult task of identifying the records of more than one hundred veterans.I would also like to acknowledge the 442nd Veterans Club, and Club 100 for their unwavering support and assistance in the review process. I want to thank Ed Ichiyama, Sakae Takahashi, and Iwao Yokooji for their tremendous work in recognizing the contributions of Asian Pacific Americans in military intelligence and the frontlines of battle. The accounts documented for each of the 104 Distinguished Service Cross recipients underscore our faith in a Nation that produces such heroes and are a wonderful legacy for our children and grandchildren.I would also like to pay tribute to the Military Intelligence Service, whose unit citation was signed by Secretary Caldera last night, because in a profound way, my interest in this area began with the MIS.About 10 years ago, I heard of the late Colonel Richard Sakakida's remarkable experiences as an Army undercover agent in the Philippines during World War II. His MIS colleagues worked to have his extraordinary service honored by our Government and the Government of the Philippines.While working to have Colonel Sakakida's service acknowledged with appropriate decoration, I realized that there were many war heroes whose valiant service had been overlooked. I recalled that only two Asian Pacific Americans received the Medal of Honor for service during World War II. The number seemed too low when you consider the high-intensity combat experienced by the 100th and 442nd, the service of 12,000 Filipino Americans in the U.S. Army, and the dangerous assignments taken by the 6,000 members of the MIS.President Truman recognized it for what it was on a rain-drenched day in 1945, when during a White House ceremony honoring the 100th and 442nd, he observed, ``you fought not only the enemy, you fought prejudice, and you have won.''Mr. President, these men are not being awarded the Medal of Honor because of their race. They are being given their due recognition for their exceptional acts of valor. Fifty-five years ago, our country refused to appropriately recognize that these men distinguished themselves by gallantry and audacious courage, risking their lives in service above and beyond the call of duty.This is a great day to be an American, and I am honored to stand before the Senate to pay tribute to these 22 men who fought to defend our great Nation. In their memory and in celebration of our Nation's everlasting commitment to justice and liberty, I honor these 22 men and their achievements and offer them the highest praise for all they have done to keep us free.",

    "text": "Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, for yielding time. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the Democratic skills training amendment to the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. This amendment further increases our country's human capital by adding $1.05 billion to skills training programs at the U.S. Department of Labor.Mr. President, while I commend the chairman and ranking member for their efforts in coming forward with a bill that avoids many of the drastic cuts approved by the House of Representatives, there are still a number of vital programs that continue to be seriously underfunded. This amendment provides adequate funding for Federal skills training programs to serve more individuals who are seeking to improve their ability to contribute to the workplace. Today's global economy demands that the United States do all it can to ensure that every member of our workforce is prepared to meet new workplace chllenges. Unfortunately, the gap between high-skilled and low-skilled workers continues to grow, leaving many at the lower end of the spectrum even farther behind.One particular program I would like to mention is the Fathers Work, Families Win program. This important initiative improves the employment potential of certain low income individuals who generally have lower levels of education and work experience. As a result, these individuals usually end up accepting jobs that pay relatively low wages and have few benefits. They often have irregular track records in employment: they hold several jobs at a time, work part-time or intermittently, or endure periods of unemployment. Many of these individuals have been on the welfare rolls or are living under conditions that make them vulnerable to becoming dependent on Federal assistance.We must not forget that these individuals have the potential to make meaningful contributions to the economy and, given the opportunity, can become self-sufficient and successfully support their families. This is one reason why I am interested in seeing the Fathers Work, Families Win program funded. The portion of the program entitled Families Win provides $130 million in competitive grants for programs to help low income parents stay employed, move up the career ladder, and remain off welfare.The program's Fathers Work component provides $125 million for competitive grants to help certain non-custodial parents find a job, maintain employment, and advance on their career path. This is important because many fathers, rather than being ``deadbeat dads,'' are ``dead broke dads.'' They have the desire to support their families through child support payments and other means, but cannot do so because they cannot secure or maintain steady employment paying a living wage.Fathers Work, Families Win would build on the investments and partnerships started under the Workforce Investment Act and the Welfare-to-Work program. State and local Workforce Investment Boards are eligible applicants under both parts of Fathers Work, Families Win. These boards have been implementing WIA [weeeea] across the country, reforming the way in which job training and job placement services are conducted. The competitive grant program funds enable the Boards to further integrate services for the population of low income workers under programs such as WIA, Wagner-Peyser [wag-ner pie-zer] grants, Welfare-to-Work grants, and grants under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. This integrated approach will help to ensure that many low income families will not fall through the cracks and will find it easier to use the network of services at their disposal.I continue to be a strong supporter of the Welfare-to-Work program. Last year, I introduced the Welfare-to-Work Amendments of 1999 which included provisions to reauthorize the program and to improve access to the program for more low income individuals. The eligibility changes were included in the consolidated appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000, which I thank my colleagues for working on and supporting. However, the Welfare-to-Work program itself has not yet been renewed. With eligibility changes taking effect for competitive grantees at the beginning of 2000 and for formula grantees later this year, Welfare-to-Work efforts must be given more time to run. If the program is not reauthorized, worthwhile efforts at the State and local levels to help low income families will be adversely impacted.Because the Welfare-to-Work program has not been extended, many local communities are concerned because their efforts to help Welfare-to-Work participants have just begun. An abrupt end to the program would cause significant investments to go to waste. As the U.S. Conference of Mayors states in a letter dated June 10, 2000, ``Without the extension of the Welfare-to-Work program, welfare reform will be dealt a serious set back in our nation's cities which are home to the highest concentrations of people still on welfare.'' I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.",

    "text": "The letter goes on to note that although welfare rolls have decreased significantly across the country, ``great numbers of former welfare clients living in cities who are in need of services still remain.'' These are the hardest-to-help families who need our greatest assistance. Furthermore, many of these individuals will be reaching their lifetime limit on welfare benefits imposed by the 1996 welfare reform law and will no longer be able to rely on regular cash assistance to support their families. We cannot allow these families to be left without any safety net and should continue pursuing efforts to ``teach them how to fish''--this is what the amendment before us would do.While I am disappointed that the bill before us does not extend the Welfare-to-Work program, I hope that under the eligibility changes I helped to pass last year, Welfare-to-Work program accomplishments will continue to grow and provide strong impetus for the program's reauthorization. In the meantime, I strongly urge my colleagues to support programs such as Fathers Work, Families Win for low income individuals.It is interesting to note that in 1998 and 1999, while the nation was experiencing low unemployment, layoffs were still widespread. This trend was mainly due to companies requiring new skills to meet the demands of a new economy. Unfortunately, as we have seen by the announcements of large-scale layoffs from companies such as Coca-Cola, J.C. Penney Company, and Exxon Mobil Corporation, the situation is not getting any better.So, why are we in Congress looking at reducing or eliminating funding for vital programs that empower former welfare recipients and low-wage workers with the information and skills necessary to become viable citizens in their communities? Skills Training programs are essential to ensure that displaced workers will be able to transition into another trade. We must not forget that the Federal Reserve Board is reviewing the possibility of raising interest rates in an effort to slow down U.S. economic growth. This could negatively impact not only Hawaii's economy, especially the construction industry that is one of Hawaii's leading areas for job growth, but the nation as a whole. Hawaii's economy is just recovering from a decade of economic stagnation and layoffs and cannot afford another recession without providing the necessary funds for skills training programs.The current and proposed funding levels for skills training programs are inadequate to ensure the availability of a trained workforce. We must remain committed in our efforts to equip employers with an employment system capable of addressing potential labor shortages. For the State of Hawaii, eliminating all new funding for One Stop Career Centers/Labor Market Information will adversely impact Hawaii's ability to comply with the Workforce Investment Act. Hawaii will not be able to develop core employment statistics products used by employers, job seekers, educators, students, and others. More specifically, valuable labor market information would no longer be provided to the public.I commend Hawaii's Job Corps program for its successful placement rate of 70 percent. This is significant given Hawaii's fragile economy in recent years. The success of this program clearly illustrates the positive effect the skills training programs have on our communities. We should not reduce or eliminate funding for these vital programs that enhance employment opportunities for individuals and their families.The amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, would address the potential shortcomings in funding as proposed in the House and Senate. This amendment provides appropriate funding for the Department of Labor's Youth and Adult Employment and Training Programs, especially funding for Dislocated Worker assistance, Youth Opportunity grants, Job Corps, and One Stop Career Centers. In addition, this amendment also provides appropriate funding for the Summer Jobs program resulting from implementation of the Workforce Investment Act.We must continue to improve our skills training program to ensure that America's workforce remains competitive to the global economy. I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.",

    "title": "STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS",
    "text": "Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Federal Services Subcommittee, I am pleased to introduce legislation to amend the Whistleblower Protection Act, WPA, one of the cornerstone of our nation's good government laws. Enacted in 1989, the WPA is intended to protect federal employees from workplace retaliation when disclosing waste, fraud, or abuse. The law was passed unanimously in 1989, and strengthened through amendments in 1994, again with unanimous support of both houses of Congress. I am joined today by Senator Levin, who was a primary sponsor of the landmark 1989 Act and the 1994 amendments.A key goal of the Whistleblower Protection Act was to close the loopholes that had developed under prior law. Back in 1978, Congress passed the Civil Service Reform Act, which included statutory whistleblower rights that elevated certain disclosures to absolute protection due to their public policy significance. The 1978 Act protected ``a'' disclosure evidencing a reasonable belief of specified misconduct, with certain listed statutory exceptions--classified or other information whose release was specifically barred by other statutes. Despite statutory language, the Federal Court of Appeals, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the Office of Special Counsel--all created in 1978 to investigate and adjudicate the WPA--appeared to interpret the law as discretionary rather than absolute.This removed the law's foundation. Congress, in 1978, had intended to create absolute categories of protection to end the inherent chilling effect in constitutional balancing tests that required employees to guess whether they were covered by the First Amendment. Congress sought to eliminate the confusion by resolving the balance in favor of free speech rights for serious misconduct listed in the statute. Unfortunately, the Federal Circuit and administrative agencies did not respect this mandate and created loopholes based on factors irrelevant to the public, such as whether an employee had selfless motives or was the first to expose particular misconduct.As a result, a cornerstone of the Whistleblower Protection Act was to close these loopholes that arose under prior law by amending protection of ``a'' disclosure to ``any'' disclosure which meets the law's standards. The purpose was to clearly prohibit any new exceptions to the law's coverage. Only Congress has that authority. Again, however, in both formal and informal interpretations of the Act, loopholes continued to proliferate.Congress responded to this reluctance to abide by congressional intent through the passage of the 1994 amendments. The Governmental Affairs Committee report on the amendments rebutted prior interpretations by the Federal Circuit, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the Office of Special Counsel that there were exceptions to ``any.'' The Committee report concluded, ``The plain language of the Whistleblower Protection Act extends to retaliation for `any disclosure,' regardless of the setting of the disclosure, the form of the disclosure, or the person to whom the disclosure is made.''I am pleased to note that since the enactment of the 1994 amendments, both the Office of the Special Counsel and the Merit Systems Protection Board generally have honored congressional boundaries. However, the Federal Circuit continues to disregard clear statutory language that the Act covers disclosures made to supervisors, to possible wrongdoers (Horton v. Dept. of Navy 66 F.3d 279, 1995), or as part of their job duties. (Willis v. Dept. of Agriculture, 141 F.3d 1139, 1998).In order to protect the statute's cornerstone that ``any\" lawful disclosure evidencing significant abuse is covered by the Whistleblower Protection Act, our bill would codify the repeated and unconditional statements of congressional intent and legislative history. It would amend sections 2302(b)(8)(A) and 2302(b)(8)(B) of title 5, U.S.C. to protect any disclosure of information. This would be without restriction to time, place, form, motive or context, made to any audience unless specifically excluded in section 2302(b)(8) by an employee or applicant, including a disclosure made in the ordinary course of an employee's duties, which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or other misconduct specified in section 2302(b)(8). These include gross waste, gross mismanagement, abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. Consistent with current law, if the disclosure evidences a prohibited personnel practice against the employee making the disclosure, his or her remedy will continue to be available through section 2302(b)(9), rather than section 2302(b)(8).The exceptions resulting from the Federal Circuit's rulings defeat the underlying good government goals of the Whistleblower Protection Act by removing protection where it counts the most: for federal employees, who acting as public servants, are carrying out their responsibilities to the public as employees of their agencies. By stripping protection from in-house disclosures, the Federal Circuit imposed loopholes that chill employees from working within their agencies to address potential waste, mismanagement, or abuse issues. If employees seek to solve problems within the chain of command, they could forfeit their rights to whistleblower protection from subsequent retaliation under the Court's rulings in Horton and Willis. To maintain protection against reprisal, federal employees must now bypass normal organizational activities responsible for implementing the law. Moreover, the loophole created by Willis removes protection when employees are performing their job duties. Because of the Court's rulings, the intent of the Act to create an environment where federal employees can safely serve the public on the job has been compromised.Secondly, the legislation would institutionalize a principle currently expressed by a ban on spending on enforcement of any nondisclosure agreement that does not contain language specifically protecting an employee's rights under various open government statutes. This includes the Whistleblower Protection Act, the Military Whistleblower Protection Act, and the Lloyd Lafollette Act, which prohibits discrimination against government employees who communicate with Congress. This prohibition has been passed on an annual basis since 1988 as part of the yearly appropriations process. Our bill would make it a prohibited personnel practice to take a personnel action implementing or enforcing nondisclosure rules without specific notice of the listed statutes and their supremacy in the event of a conflict.The appropriations provision, known as the ``anti-gag statute,'' has proved effective against attempts by agencies to override the Whistleblower Protection Act through prior restraint. The law originally passed as a spending control against abuses of national security secrecy, in which as a procedural prerequisite for security clearances, employees had to waive their constitutional and statutory free speech rights. Since its passage, however, it has been useful against gag orders in broad areas of specific and generic public concerns, including gag orders imposed as a precondition for employment and resolution of disputes, as well as general agency policies barring employees from communicating directly with Congress or the public. Prior restraint not only has a severe chilling effect, but strikes at the heart of this body's ability to perform its oversight duties by negating the repeatedly reaffirmed unequivocal congressional policy that whistleblowers have the right to make protected disclosures anonymously as a way to prevent retaliation.Disclosing classified information is prohibited by law except to specific audiences listed in section 2302 and would not be a protected disclosure under this legislation. Nor would this legislation require the Merit System Protection Board to review security clearance determinations. The Supreme Court clearly spoke on this issue in Dept. of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), which found that denial of a security clearance is not . . . an ``adverse action.'' The Court upheld the Board's jurisdiction over due process procedures underlying a clearance decision. Egan stands as a bright line test, and if an employee requests review of the substantive judgments underlying a security clearance, OSC examiners, administrative judges, and members of the MSPB would be justified in denying jurisdiction. However, the Board could have jurisdiction if an employee complained that he or she suffered a prohibited personnel practice, because he or she was forced to sign an illegal nondisclosure agreement or its terms were enforced, regardless of context.Congress repeatedly has reaffirmed its intent that employees should not be forced to sign agreements that supercede an employee's rights under good government statutes. Moreover, Congress has unanimously supported the concept that federal employees should not be subject to prior restraint from disclosing wrongdoing nor suffer retaliation for speaking out.Lastly, the bill provides the Special Counsel with authority to appear and represent the interests of the Office of Special Counsel in civil actions brought in connection with the exercise of its authority to protect the merit system against prohibited personnel practices under section 2302(b)(8) and violations of the Hatch Act. It also gives the Special Counsel the right to seek review of decisions by the Merit Systems Protection Board before the Federal Circuit where the Special Counsel determines that the Board issued an erroneous decision in a whistleblower retaliation case or in a case arising under the Hatch Act, or that the Board's decision will have a substantial impact on the enforcement of those laws.Under the bill, in Board cases in which the Special Counsel was not a party, the Special Counsel must first petition the Board for reconsideration of its decision before seeking review. The Court of Appeals shall grant petitions for review by the Special Counsel at its discretion.This additional authority would enable the Office of Special Counsel to fulfill its statutory missions more effectively to protect federal whistleblowers against retaliation and to enforce the Hatch Act. While OSC, under current law, has a central role as public prosecutor in cases before the Merit Systems Protection Board, it in no way authorizes OSC to seek judicial review of an MSPB decision that the Special Counsel considers erroneous. Our legislation recognizes that providing the Special Counsel the authority to seek such review--in precedential cases--is crucial to ensuring the promotion of the public interests furthered by these statutes.Moreover, under existing law, the Special Counsel cannot appear to represent himself or herself as a party, or even as an amicus curiae, where another party has invoked the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals in a whistleblower retaliation or Hatch Act case. As a result, the Special Counsel, who Congress intended would be a vigorous, independent advocate for protection of the merit system, cannot participate at all in the arena in which the law is largely shaped: the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. This bill reflects our conviction that the public interests underlying the whistleblower retaliation laws and the Hatch Act are best served by ensuring that the Special Counsel's views are considered by the Court in important cases.Mr. President, there is significant history that defines congressional intent with respect to ensuring that federal whistleblowers are protected from retaliatory measures. It is my intention that this bill will begin the needed dialogue to guarantee that any disclosures within the boundaries of the statutory language are protected. As the ranking member of the Federal Services Subcommittee, I will seek hearings in the next Congress on the Whistleblower Protection Act and the amendments I am proposing today. It is my intention to request a hearing that would be independent of any reauthorization hearing held for the MSPB and the OSC, both of whose authority expires in 2002.There is strong support for the legislation Senator Levin and I are introducing today. I ask unanimous consent, in addition to the text of the bill, that I be allowed to insert into the Record immediately following my statement, a petition signed by the heads of 72 organizations urging Congress to restore the Whistleblower Protection Act to its 1994 boundaries. Among the 70-plus groups that support this effort are the AFL-CIO, American Federation of Government Employees, Blacks in Government, National Association of Treasury Agents, National Treasury Employees Union, Common Cause, and the Federation of American Scientists. I also wish to extend my appreciation to the Special Counsel and the Acting Chair of the Merit Systems Protection Board for the technical assistance they provided. Lastly, I would like to commend the Government Accountability Project for its dedication and perseverance over the years. Since 1977, GAP has sought to protect the public interest and promote government accountability by defending whistleblowers.I urge my colleagues to join me in the effort to ensure that congressional intent embodied in the Whistleblower Protection Act is codified to ensure that the law is not weakened further.",

    "title": "ROLE OF THE FEDERAL OMBUDSMEN IN DISPUTE RESOLUTION",
    "text": "Mr. President, last week the General Accounting Office, GAO, released a report I requested entitled ``Human Capital: The Role of Ombudsmen in Dispute Resolution.'' The report studies the use of Federal ombudsman offices as an informal alternative to existing and more conventional processes to deal with personnel conflicts inside Federal agencies.I know that traditional formal dispute resolution processes have long been criticized. To address these concerns, the Federal Government promotes and encourages alternative methods including the use of ombudsmen. This has resulted in the greater use of alternative dispute resolution, ADR, practices, both because of legislation, specifically the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1990, ADRA, and because of a desire to resolve workplaces conflicts quickly to the mutual benefit of both the employee and the agency. I wish to point out that ombudsmen are not themselves an alternative means of dispute resolution, but rather a neutral practitioner of dispute resolution practices, including ADR techniques, to handle complaints.I support strong workplace protections to protect Federal employees from arbitrary agency actions and prohibited personnel practices. Ombudsmen provide another way to ensure a more rapid conclusion to workplace problems. These offices may also provide another tool in assisting agencies in attracting, retaining, and motivating their workforces. In fact, this report concludes that ``ombudsman offices can offer a useful option for agencies to consider in developing their overall human capital management policies and practices.'' Another plus is that these offices focus on identifying systemic issues and developing conflict prevention strategies.The GAO identified 22 workplace ombudsman offices in 10 agencies. Their ``best practices'' report focuses for illustrative purposes on offices within three agencies: The National Institutes of Health, NIH, the International Broadcasting Bureau, IBB, and the U.S. Secret Service.NIH has one of the most developed ombudsman offices, which was established in 1997, and now has four full time ombudsman. The IBB office began as a part-time position in 1988, and now has two full-time officials. The Secret Service's office, started in 1987, employs one full-time staff member and nine collateral-duty people serving the Secret Service's field offices.These ombudsmen are high-level managers with broad authority to deal with almost any workplace issue, including answering questions about agency policies, cutting through ``red tape,'' counseling employees and coaching them on how to manage situations, handling accusations about employment discrimination, and workplace safety issues. Ombudsmen are a resource for Federal workers with workplace issues; an office which they can consult that is independent, neutral, and provides confidentiality.The 1990 ADRA authorizes the use of ombudsman offices but does not define or set standards for an ombudsman. The Act, as amended in 1996, established the Interagency ADR Working Group. There is also a Coalition of Federal Ombudsmen. The NIH, IBB, and Secret Service ombudsmen who participated in the GAO report are involved with both these and outside organizations. Some of the non-Federal Government organizations have published or drafted standards of practice for ombudsmen. These standards focus on the core principals of independence, neutrality, and confidentiality, which requires a commitment from the highest levels within an agency. This commitment is the guiding force in the success of the three offices studied by the In addition to support from senior management, an ombudsman office must work closely with unions representing Federal workers. The General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority has issued guidance concerning the establishment of ADR programs and the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. It is essential that ombudsmen do not come in conflict with the role of unions in protecting worker rights. From the case studies examined by the GAO, there appeared to be good relations between ombudsmen and unions in the agencies where employees are represented by unions. As agencies consider this and other alternatives to traditional dispute resolution, there must be assurances that employees' rights are maintained throughout the process of implementing these practices.I recommend this General Accounting Office report to my colleagues, and I commend Anthony P. Lofaro of the GAO for his contribution to this report, along with Stephen Altman and Katherine Brentzel. It provides excellent background and a best practices blueprint for Federal agencies as they consider employing ombudsman to assist their employees.",

    "title": "THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE AS A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE",
    "text": "Madam President, I rise today to call attention to the dedicated men and women in our Federal workforce and the invaluable contributions they make to our Nation.The tragic events three weeks ago appropriately has focused our attention on new ways to protect our Nation's critical infrastructure. A number of activities have been identified including communication, emergency services, and transportation. All are essential to the running of our country. However, on September 11 we were all quickly reminded of another critical infrastructure--our Federal Government and its workforce. For every essential service these attacks disrupted, we expected our government to respond quickly and effectively--and those in government did. Our Nation's recovery will be aided because of the talents and professionalism of our Federal workforce.Like us all, I was struck by the heroism of rescue workers in the moments following the events of September 11. Law enforcement officers, firefighters, and others raced into buildings to save lives. Teachers calmed children in schools and kept them safe from the surrounding horrors. Local officials executed response plans and coordinated resources. These are among the many examples we will long remember.Representatives from the Federal Government worked side by side with those brave and selfless local and State heroes. Various federal agencies responded to immediate social and community needs by providing temporary food and shelter, emergency child care, and other support services. At ground-zero, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers, and other Federal agencies worked with State and local rescue workers. They set up emergency and coordinated disaster responses, opened communications, and provided needed medical assistance. Federal transportation agencies worked with industry to put our air, rail, and road networks back into operation. Our Federal Law Enforcement Officers and intelligence specialists spent long hours in intense investigations to track down the terrorists and their networks. More than 2,100 federal employees were deployed in disaster response teams alone, not counting the thousands of others who responded to this national crisis as a part of their normal duties.Despite the attacks, Americans were able to rely on their government. We received our mail. The Federal Government ensured the stability of our financial markets and Americans were able to count on the reliability of their banks.Our Federal workforce responded in other ways not as immediately obvious, but just as important to our country's needs. Federal employees ensured the availability of a clean blood supply and monitored the quality of our air and water. Aid was provided through the timely processing of claims for survivors of victims and financial assistance for those not covered by unemployment insurance. Special loans were made available to small businesses and residents displaced by the disaster.Despite the events of September 11, our Nation is functioning and recovering. This is due in part to the efforts of our Federal workforce whose response was immediate and thorough. The Federal workforce is this nation's backbone. Our ability to be resolute in confronting a faceless enemy is partially attributable to the strength of our backbone. We can take comfort and pride in the resilience and fortitude of our government workers.",

    "title": "AMERICAN AGRICULTURE'S VULNERABILITY TO BIOTERRORISM",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today to address the issue of detecting biological agents that could be used in malicious attacks against our Nation's agricultural industry.Last month, I introduced S. 1560, the Biological Agent-Environmental Detection Act of 2001, which calls for the development of new technologies to detect disease agents that can be used as terrorist weapons against humans.I am drafting legislation to address concerns about agricultural security that will complement the provisions in S. 1715, the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001, which I have cosponsored.We have heard testimony in hearings before the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services illustrating the vulnerability of American agriculture to acts of biological terrorism directed against livestock and crops, commonly known as ``agroterrorism.''Any agroterrorist attacks could have a profound effect on the overall American economy. The combined cash receipts for crops, livestock, and poultry in the United States reached nearly $200 billion last year, or 2 percent of our gross domestic product. An agroterrorist attack would also create a ripple effect on businesses that rely on American agricultural products, especially grocery stores and restaurants.For example, agroterrorist attacks could reach across the agricultural industry of Hawaii, which had $521 million in revenues last year. Our livestock could be attacked with viral agents such as foot and mouth disease. In Hawaii, this would affect the price and availability of beef, pork, and dairy products. 51,000 cattle and 26,000 hogs were brought to market and slaughtered in Hawaii last year, while 90 million gallons of milk were produced by the Hawaiian dairy industry. Our $100 million pineapple industry could be attacked with a nematode pest that causes an estimated 40-percent loss of crop in the first year of infection, and 80- to 100-percent losses in subsequent crops. Hawaii's growing agricultural tourism industry was worth $26 million in 2000, and any attacks on Hawaiian agriculture would also impact those revenues.However, the impact of terrorist attacks against American agriculture would not be measured in economic terms alone. A significant loss of agricultural production would also affect the health and welfare of our nation's citizens, not to mention hundreds of millions of men, women, and children around the globe who depend on American agricultural production for some part of their daily meals.My colleagues are aware of the recent completion of the Human Genome Project to map the basic genetic information contained in human chromosomes. This vast undertaking involved the sequencing of over three billion base pairs of genetic information.The diseases that attack crops and livestock are caused primarily by bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Each of these microorganisms has its own miniature genome that can be sequenced with a fraction of the effort involved in the Human Genome Project. For example, only last month, scientists at the Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute sequenced the genomes of 15 bacterial species, including plant and human pathogens.In many cases, we still seek to understand the most rudimentary features of disease-causing microorganisms, regardless of whether they infect humans, livestock, or plants. By sequencing the DNA of select agricultural diseases agents, we can develop diagnostic tests to rapidly identify agricultural diseases; we gain fundamental information about how each disease is caused; and we learn how to mitigate or prevent the negative effects of diseases that infect crops and livestock.By preparing to detect the intentional spread of disease through bioterrorist attacks on America's agriculture, we are also protecting American crops and livestock from the accidental or natural spread of diseases. With rapid diagnostic tests based on genomic information, we can avoid the spread of such diseases as the papaya ringspot virus, which is carried by aphids throughout infected orchards in Hawaii. However, Hawaii's agricultural system clearly is not the only industry that would benefit from pathogen detection systems. The fungal pathogen Fusarium, which infects many Hawaiian crops, including sugarcane, ginger, and banana, also attacks watermelons in Texas, potatoes in Idaho, and tomatoes in Ohio.I commend my colleagues for their efforts to protect our urban areas from further bioterrorist attacks. However, let's not forget agricultural America. We must support the development of rapid detection methods that are based on genomic information from disease agents that could be used in bioterrorist attacks against American agriculture.",

    "title": "SENATOR TED KENNEDY'S 70TH BIRTHDAY",
    "text": "Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues from both sides of the aisle who have taken to the Senate floor to offer heartfelt tributes and best wishes to our esteemed colleague and friend, the senior Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) as he celebrates his 70th birthday. While prior commitments precluded my participation in yesterday's bipartisan tribute, I wanted to take a moment to offer my congratulations to Senator Kennedy.For 40 of his 70 years, Ted Kennedy has worked for the people of Massachusetts and America in the United States Senate. During that time, through hard work, consensus building and perseverance, with great wit and charm, and, on many memorable occasions, passionate oratory, Ted Kennedy has established himself as one of the most effective legislators of the 20th century and a champion for equality, opportunity, and justice for all Americans.When I was appointed to the Senate in 1990, we were considering the Americans With Disabilities Act, one of the many landmark civil rights bills that Ted Kennedy has helped to inspire and craft, guide through Congress, and become law. For as long as I have been in public service, Ted Kennedy has been a powerful voice and an advocate for those who are most vulnerable in our Nation. On issues ranging from civil rights, voting rights, equal rights for women, equal protection for all Americans regardless gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation, Americans with disabilities, access to health care, quality education for all children, workers' rights, patients' rights, a decent minimum wage, food stamps, or equal justice for all Americans, Ted Kennedy has been at the forefront of the battles for equal opportunity for all Americans, for fairness, for justice.In 1963, speaking on civil rights for African Americans, President Kennedy said that ``every American ought to have the right to be treated as he would wish to be treated, as one would wish his children to be treated. This is not the case.'' Throughout his illustrious career, Ted Kennedy has worked to ensure that all Americans are treated fairly, are treated with respect and dignity. His work in the Senate has helped us move forward as a people and Nation toward the vision of America that President Kennedy and Senator Robert F. Kennedy spoke about with such eloquence. His effectiveness in forging bipartisan partnerships to advance the causes and issues he cares so much about is legendary. As the Majority Leader said, Ted Kennedy is the master of the principled compromise. In doing so, Ted inspires those of us lucky enough to serve with him with his dedication, persistence and hard work, and he has earned the admiration, respect, and love of people across America.As both a colleague and friend, no one is more generous with his time or considerate than Ted Kennedy. The senior Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin) and some of my colleagues mentioned that in some parts of their states being accused of voting too much like Ted Kennedy is a standard political reproach. In Hawaii, a comparison to Ted Kennedy is a badge of honor. In 1990, I was appointed to the Senate in May, and was campaigning for election in November. My race was extremely close, and the Senate was in session until the last week of October working on the Federal budget. Then President George H.W. Bush and other national leaders had come to the islands to campaign for my opponent. Ted Kennedy agreed to campaign with me in Hawaii right before the election. His appearance energized the voters, and sparked a surge in the polls that broke open a close race. In fact, on election night, Ted Kennedy was the first person to call with congratulations based on exit poll projections he had received.In the history of the Senate, there have been few Senators whose record of accomplishments, whose hard work, whose contributions to building a more perfect Union, equals that of the senior Senator from Massachusetts. I am proud to serve with him in the Senate and fortunate to call him a friend. It is with the deepest admiration and profound aloha that I wish Ted, hau'oli la hanau, a most Happy Birthday. May you have many more. God bless you.",

    "title": "TRIBUTE TO THE HEROISM OF ISAAC HO'OPI'I",
    "text": "Mr. President, it is with great pride that I come to the floor today to speak about the courageous and heroic acts of a dear friend and constituent, Defense Protective Service Officer Isaac Ho'opi'i. I have always said that Hawaii is a unique place not because of its beauty, but because of its people. The people of Hawaii share a special attitude, which has been referred to as the ``Aloha spirit.'' Aloha in Hawaiian has a number of meanings, including love. The Aloha spirit can best be explained as the love of others and is illustrated through acts of kindness. Isaac Ho'opi'i exemplifies and lives the Aloha spirit.I rise today to honor the actions of Officer Isaac Ho'opi'i, who was awarded the Office of Secretary Medal of Valor for his efforts in responding to the tragedy at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. There have been a number of news articles and television segments recounting Isaac's heroic actions in the wake of tragic events at the Pentagon on September 11.Isaac is most well-known as ``the voice'' in the dark smoke, moments after Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, calling for anyone who was in the blackened, smoke-filled corridors to come toward his voice. Seven people responded to his calls to head toward his voice and were guided safely out of the burning Pentagon on September 11. Isaac also physically carried at least eight individuals out of the burning building on that fateful day. He and his K-9 partner, Vito, worked 36 hours straight immediately after the plane crashed into the Pentagon--they have continued on 12-hour shifts since.I was honored to attend the Medal of Valor ceremonies on Tuesday afternoon at the Pentagon. I witnessed Isaac receiving the Medal of Valor, the highest award in the Department of Defense for a civilian. 38 other individuals also received the award on Tuesday, and I salute their brave acts as well.Isaac, born and raised in Hawaii, has lived in Washington, D.C., for the past twelve years and has spent the last five years as a member of the Defense Protective Service. I have known Isaac for over 12 years. I first met him when I was a member of the House of Representatives. My family and I have spent time with Isaac and his family, his wife Gigi, and their children, Emily, Bess, and Jeff, on many occasions.When I spoke to him after September 11, and discussed his split-second decision to respond to the burning Pentagon with little concern for his personal safety, I asked him how he felt. He modestly discounted his heroic actions. I was told by others that Isaac felt badly after September 11, because he felt that he should have been able to help more people. I am sure that those 15 people who he personally helped out of the Pentagon, and their families, are very thankful for his quick thinking and willingness to risk his life. His own wife and family had no idea about his safety on September 11, because of his immediate response to the site.Isaac is a man who is always willing to help others. During the awards ceremony, Mr. Paul Haselbush, Director of the Real Estate and Facilities Directorate, mentioned a letter he received from a woman who had been stranded on the road with a flat tire for three hours in the cold. She wrote to the Department of Defense to thank the Defense Protective Service for the actions of Officer Isaac Ho'opi'i, who saw her stranded on the road, stopped to help her, and fixed her flat tire. When she saw his name, she recognized Isaac as ``the voice'' that she had read about in the newspaper who had saved some of the people in the Pentagon on September 11th.In November of last year, Isaac went home to Hawaii for a family vacation. Isaac took one week of his vacation to talk to students in schools, not about his heroic acts, but about the events of September 11th and to answer their questions about why terrorists would attack the United States. I asked Isaac why he spoke with the students. He told me that he wanted to inspire them to reach out for their goals and dreams--that if he, a Native Hawaiian boy raised in Waianae could move to Washington, D.C., become successful by helping others and sharing the Aloha Spirit, they could all do the same. He told me if he just reached one student his time would have been spent well. Isaac reached more than one student. He has received a number of letters from the students he spoke to during his trip to Hawaii.On Tuesday, when I told Isaac that I was so very proud of him, he smiled, and told me that he was just trying to be a good Hawaiian and to share the spirit of Aloha. Isaac Ho'opi'i is indeed a wonderful man, a wonderful American, and his actions reflect the Aloha Spirit, the essence of the people of Hawaii. It is with great pride that I congratulate Isaac Ho'opi'i and the other 38 recipients of the Medal of Valor for their courageous acts on September 11, 2001. ",

    "title": "DEDICATION OF SPARK MATSUNAGA ELEMENTARY AND LONGVIEW SCHOOL",
    "text": "Madam President, on Sunday I had the privilege of attending the dedication ceremony for the Spark Matsunaga Elementary and Longview School in Germantown, Maryland. This exceptional state-of-the-art school facility houses a general education elementary school, Spark Matsunaga Elementary, and special education school for children with disabilities, Longview School.It is appropriate that this new school honors the memory of a truly remarkable man and former colleague--Senator Spark Matsunaga. Over the course of a lifetime of service to the people of Hawaii and America, Spark exhibited fortitude, courage, and persistence in fighting for what was right and what was best.As noted by Dr. Jerry Weast, superintendent of Montgomery County Public Schools, this is the first public school in the nation named in honor of an Asian American. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta, Representative Connie Morella, Hawaii State Senator Matt Matsunaga, and Keene Matsunaga were a few of the speakers who spoke of Senator Matsunaga's distinguished life and career. A children's chorus entertained and sang the school song. The ``Home of the Geckos,'' Matsunaga Elementary has made a wonderful start with dedicated teachers and administrators and a diverse and involved community of students and parents.Spark Matsunaga's commitment to justice and lifetime of service to America merits this singular recognition. Throughout his career, Sparky worked to ensure that all Americans enjoyed the fruits of liberty and understood our shared responsibilities for keeping our country free and strong.Spark Matsunaga's legacy of public service, espousal of the art of peacemaking, and commitment to justice is a wonderful example for the students and staff that proudly work and learn at Matsunaga Elementary School.I know that Helene Matsunaga and the Matsunaga family are deeply appreciative of this unprecedented tribute, and the people of Hawaii take pride in Montgomery County bestowing this honor on Senator Matsunaga and his service to our great Nation.Madam President, I ask that a copy of the commemorative biography of Spark Matsunaga distributed at the dedication be printed in the Record.The biography folllows:Our school is proud to bear the name of this great American whose legacy will inspire our community forever. Senator Matsunaga's memory will serve to remind students and staff that public service, strong educational goals, patriotism and personal pride are qualities to live by. Senator Matsunaga will be remembered for all his work to teach the principles of peace yet value just causes for humanity. He knew when to use his talents to inspire change and was never afraid to stand proudly to have his voice heard. Spark Matsunaga, a war hero who became a Untied States Senator from Hawaii, dedicated his career to promoting peace and achieving justice. A Japanese-American, Matsunaga served with distinction in the 100th Infantry battalion, the first Japanese American unit formed during World War II, for which he received the Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts. As a political leader, he was a champion of civil rights for all Americans regardless of race. As a member of the United States Senate, he worked to promote the peaceful resolution of conflicts, and he fought for the redress for survivors of the World War II internment camps. Masayuki Matsunaga was born on the Island of Kauai, Hawaii, on October 8, 1916. His childhood friends nicknamed him Spark; he later legally adopted the name. Matsunaga attended the Kauai public schools before entering the University of Hawaii in 1937, majoring in education and serving in the Reserve Officer Training Corps. Upon graduation in June 194l, Matsunaga was commissioned in the Army and was serving on active duty on the island of Molokai when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Shortly afterward, he and other Japanese-Americans were relieved of their duties and shipped to a military facility, Camp McCoy, in Wisconsin, while the War Department in Washington decided whether they could fight for America. Matsunaga, along with the other soldiers, petitioned President Roosevelt for a chance to prove their loyalty. In the Spring of 1942, President Roosevelt and other Washington leaders determined that Japanese-Americans in the army would be loyal to the country; Matsunaga and 1,500 other Japanese-Americans formed the 100th Infantry Battalion and trained for combat duty. In September 1943, the battalion was sent to Italy; Matsunaga was wounded twice in the same night while moving through a minefield. After recuperating, Matsunaga could not go back to combat but received two Purple Hearts and the Bronze Star for his heroic acts, and was assigned to a replacement battalion. Late in the war, he returned to the U.S. where he gave 800 speeches to help Japanese-Americans become integrated into the mainstream of American life after being released from the detention camps where they were kept during the war. The 100th Infantry Battalion eventually became a part of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team of Japanese-American soldiers, the most decorated unit in U.S. military history. Matsunaga returned to Hawaii in 1946, worked in veterans affairs briefly, married, and then entered Harvard Law School in 1948. After graduation, he practiced law in Hawaii and began his political career, being elected to the Territorial Legislature in which was known as the ``Democratic Revolution'' of 1954 engineered by veterans of the 100th and 442nd to take control of the legislature for the first time. Matsunaga and other Japanese-Americans were among the leaders in Hawaii's bid for statehood, which passed in 1959. In 1962, Matsunaga won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, making the rights of immigrants, the welfare of veterans, and the defense of Japanese-Americans and other minorities his hallmarks. In 1976, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, supporting legislation to establish a research organization called the United States Peace Institute and to authorize the post of Poet Laureate. As a Senator, he was also a major proponent of the use of renewable energy sources and Soviet-American cooperation in space exploration. Perhaps Matsunaga's greatest achievement in the Senate was obtaining redress for Japanese-Americans who had been unjustly interned during World War II. The survivors of the camps received ``token monetary compensation'' and an apology from President Ronald Reagan. Another signature legislative achievement was the Spark Matsunaga Hydrogen Research and Development Act, which was passed in 1990 and provides funding for research into alternative energy sources. His last official act was to cast a vote in favor of continuing the Clean Air Act. In 1990, Senator Matsunaga died while serving the U.S. Senate. In his honor, the University of Hawaii established the Matsunaga Institute for Peace in which scholars explore ways to resolve differences without resorting to violence. ",

    "title": "COMMENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII WARRIOR MEN'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2002 NCAA NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP",
    "text": "Madam President, I am pleased to join my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, in congratulating the University of Hawaii's Warrior Volleyball team, the 2002 NCAA National Champions. The Warriors captured the title by beating top-ranked Pepperdine University in four games Saturday evening in State College, Pennsylvania. The national championship is the first for any men's athletic program at the University of Hawaii in over 30 years of NCAA Division I competition.Hawaii finished its championship season with a 24-8 record, and out-hit and out-blocked a Pepperdine team that had beaten the Warriors in their three previous meetings this season. Saturday's victory also marked the 200th win for Warrior coach Mike Wilton in his ten-year tenure at Hawaii.Sports fans in Hawaii love the men's and women's volleyball teams at the University of Hawaii. Hawaii has led the nation in attendance for seven consecutive seasons. This season the Warriors drew 89,387 fans for 16 home matches, an average of 5,587 per match, breaking the record set last year. It is not unusual for almost 8,000 fans to pack the Stan Sheriff Center on the UH-Manoa campus for a contest against a conference rival. When you factor in the fact that all home matches are televised, you get an appreciation of the popularity of Hawaii's volleyball program.The 2002 Volleyball National Champions are an extraordinary team. They are also an international team. Three-time All-American and Final Four MVP Costas Theocharidis is from Greece; Team captain Eyal Zimet is from Israel; senior All-American Dejan Miladinovic is from Serbia. Along with Hawaii's best prep players, men from Canada, the mainland U.S., Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Guam, are a part of the 2002 Hawaii Warrior's championship team this season. It is a credit to the players, coaches, trainers and staff, that outstanding teamwork, years of hard work and conditioning, and dedication to the sport they love, have earned them the national championship.The multinational 2002 champions are splendid representatives and ambassadors for Hawaii. Hawaii is a multicultural State, where no race or ethnicity has a majority. Our Culture reflects the rich mosaic of Native Hawaiian, Asian, and Western cultures and traditions which are shared, celebrated, and appreciated by Hawaii's people and visitors to the islands. Immigrants from nations around the world have shared their rich cultures and traditions, which in combination with the indigenous Hawaiian culture, have created a special and wonderful place for residents and visitors alike.So it is with great pride and appreciation that I join my colleague from Hawaii and the people of Hawaii in honoring the 2002 National Champion University of Hawaii Warrior Volleyball team by offering a resolution commending their championship season. I ask unanimous consent that a roster of Warrior Volleyball players, coaches, and staff be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.",

    "title": "CELEBRATING ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH",
    "text": "Mr. President, every year during the month of May, our National comes together, in appreciation and celebration of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and their unique and varied history and contributions to our country. In fact, this May is the 10th Anniversary of the enactment of Public Law 102-450, which officially extended what was known as Asian Pacific American Heritage Week to the entire month of May of every year.Although celebration of Asian American and Pacific Islander cultures and histories has become a large part of Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month, this time was designated primarily to focus on learning more about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and their history. Too few of us know in any great detail the stories of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. This is discouraging because Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are such a vibrant addition to the mosaic that is America.For instance, few realize that the first Filipino community in the U.S. was established in the Louisiana bayou around 1763. Not many of us know that the Bing cherry, a popular product of the Pacific Northwest, was developed by a Chinese American horticulturist named Ah Bing. And in Florida, another Chinese American, named Lue Gim Gong, developed an orange which was resistant to frost, a boon to the Florida agricultural industry.Hawaii's Duke Kahanamoku was a five-time Olympic medal winner and is recognized internationally as the father of modern surfing. Duke Kahanamoku holds a unique place in surfing history and his Olympic feats are legendary over 80 years since their achievement.One of the most amazing advances in medicine, organ transplantation, exists today largely because of a Japanese American, Dr. Paul Terasaki, who helped develop a test to determine the compatibility of a donated organ and its intended recipient.Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, have made names for themselves in the fields of music, acting, fashion, athletics, academia, medicine, science, literature, cuisine, and many more. Immigrants from Asia and the Pacific have contributed so much to the rich American tapestry. Given their longtime presence here on our shores, there can be no denying that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are an integral part of the fabric of America.Aside from being an enriching and valuable addition to America, Asian American and Pacific Islanders are also one of the most diverse and fastest growing segments of our population. The Asian American and Pacific Islander community is made up of more than 36 distinct subpopulations with differing cultures, religions, traditions, and beliefs, speaking more than 100 different languages. U.S. Census figures show that the Asian American and Pacific Islander population grew at a rate about five times that of the national rate between 1990 and 2000. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders now make up 4.2 percent of the U.S. population, around 11.9 million people strong. The Asian American and Pacific Islander population grew by 72 percent in a single decade. While my home state of Hawaii is probably most closely identified as having a large Asian American and Pacific Islander population, it is interesting to note that in the decade between the last two decennial censuses the Asian American and Pacific Islander population in Las Vegas, Nevada, increased 286 percent, in Atlanta, Georgia, there was a 200 percent increase, in Austin/San-Marcos, Texas, an increase of 175 percent, in Denver/Boulder/Greeley, Colorado a 115 percent increase, and in Detroit/Ann Arbor/Flint, Michigan, a 111 percent increase. Hopefully these figures will begin to dispel the notion that Asian American and Pacific Islander growth is strictly a West Coast or Eastern Seaboard phenomenon.Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are also key players in our nation's fight against terrorism and efforts to improve homeland security. For instance, my good friend and former colleague, Secretary of transportation Norman Y. Mineta, is working to keep our nation's roads and skies safe. His life story is truly amazing. Interned as a young boy during World War II by his own government, he grew up to be a public servant who has devoted his life to public service on behalf of our country. From his days as a local California politician, to his service in the U.S. House of Representatives, his formation of the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies, his Chairmanship of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, his tenure as Secretary of Commerce, and now as Secretary of Transportation, Norman Mineta has broken down barriers and served his constituents and our nation with integrity and distinction.As Chief of Staff, United States Army, General Eric K. Shinseki has distinguished himself as a leader of outstanding courage and impeccable integrity. The people of Hawaii are immensely proud of Ric Shinseki, a son of Kauai who has risen to the top post in the Army. Considered an enemy alien at birth, he is the first Asian American to wear four stars. General Shinseki's illustrious career speaks to his commitment and valor and represents the promise and greatness of America. In every way, General Shinseki exemplifies what is best about our nation and the men and women sworn to defend it.I have mentioned some of the little known, yet positive, history of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, but before I conclude my remarks today, I want to highlight some less positive history, which is also little known. Our Nation has not always welcomed Asians and Pacific Islanders with open arms and sadly the treatment many immigrant groups received was truly shameful. I am speaking of events such as the internment of nearly 120,000 aliens and Americans of Japanese ancestry via Executive Order 9066 during World War II; the Immigration Act of 1924 which led to an almost complete halt of immigration from Asia; the exclusion of the Chinese laborers who built the transcontinental railroad from the famous photo of the driving of the golden spike at Promontory Point, ``whitewashing'' history of their important contribution; and the Chinese Exclusion Act, first enacted in 1882 and not repealed until 1943. Most recently, of course, we have the unfortunate acts of xenophobic and anti-Muslim violence perpetrated in the days and weeks after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on our Nation where many of the victims were actually Asian Americans.Regrettably, ignorance and prejudice continue to adversely impact Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders as they go about their daily lives. Last year, Representative David Wu from Oregon was denied entry to the Department of Energy on official business solely because of his national origin. Hawaii's Governor, Ben Cayetano, a Filipino America, was recently asked for his passport when checking into a hotel in Nevada. These high profile incidents underscore the indignities, insults, and discrimination that Americans of Asian or Pacific Islander descent encounter on a daily basis because some people feel they do not ``look American.''There is an adage that says, ``Experience is a hard teacher because she gives the test first, the lessons afterwards.'' My hope, as the 2002 Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month comes to close, is that we, as a Nation, having been through these tests, have truly learned a lesson. The theme of this year's Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month is Unity in Freedom. The simplicity of this theme belies its profoundness. Only by having the freedom to celebrate our individual diversity can we truly come together as one Nation. If you go through your pockets or purses and take out any coin minted in the United States, you will see the motto: ``E Pluribus Unum''--from many, one. This motto first appeared on our coinage back in 1795. I see ``Unity in Freedom'' as a continuation of our Nation's lengthy and grand tradition of respecting an encouraging individual rights while simultaneously acknowledging that the key to our success as a country comes from our ability to lay our individual differences aside to work together for a common goal.

    "text": "Mr. President, I rise with pleasure today to commend the National Association of Letter Carriers, NALC for their unprecedented commitment to answering the call of reducing hunger in the United States. Over 30 million Americans go hungry everyday. In the summer months, the problem is particularly acute because the demand for emergency food is high and donations are at their lowest yearly point. However, on May 11, almost 62.7 million pounds of food was collected in the 10th Annual ``Stamp Out Hunger'' food drive as a result of the dedication of NALC members.Through a combined effort by the Priority Mail division of the U.S. Postal Service and the Campbell Soup Company, postcards promoting the food drive were delivered to over 100 million postal customers in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. Then, on May 11, in addition to their daily postal duties, letter carriers volunteered to pick up donations, sort through them, and deliver the contributions to local community food banks. About 1,500 local NALC branches throughout the U.S. were involved in the drive.Others involved in the success of the nation's largest one-day effort to combat hunger were Saturn-UAW Union partnership Initiative, local United Ways, the AFL-CIO, and Family Circle creator and cartoonist Bill Keane. The Campbell Soup Company donated one million pounds of canned goods.The National Association of Letter Carriers is the union of city delivery carriers employed by the U.S. Postal Service which has a long tradition of participating in community service. The NALC ``Stamp Out Hunger'' food drive is just one example of the members' generosity and commitment to the communities that they serve.It is fitting that we applaud the sense of community displayed by the members of the NALC, who like their fellow postal workers, have demonstrated their dedication and pride in carrying out their daily jobs. I urge my colleagues to join me in commending the National Association of Letter Carriers, their sponsors, and the millions of Americans who donated food on May 11. Their geneorsity will help ease the plight of hunger for millions for men, women, and children in the United States.",

    "title": "GREATER ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE PHARMACEUTICALS ACT OF 2001--Continued",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Graham-Miller-Kennedy amendment that would establish a guaranteed Medicare prescription drug benefit for all seniors.Approximately 19 million seniors in the United States have little or no prescription drug coverage. Prescription drugs are the largest out-of-pocket health care cost for seniors. Many who cannot afford drug coverage often do not take the drugs their doctors prescribe, and one in eight senior citizens is sometimes forced to choose between buying food and buying medicine. While numerous seniors live on modest fixed incomes, prescription drug costs have increased by more than 10 percent a year since 1995. Medicare needs a voluntary prescription drug benefit so seniors have the same protection against the high cost of prescription drugs as they have for hospital care.The Graham-Miller-Kennedy amendment is the most comprehensive Medicare prescription drug benefit proposed in the Senate thus far. It provides coverage to all seniors regardless of their health or income. In Hawaii, 159,000 senior citizens and disabled Medicare beneficiaries would be eligible for coverage under the Outpatient Prescription Drug Act, 41,000 low-income seniors in Hawaii would qualify for additional assistance under the plan.Affordable premiums and copayments are key components of the Graham-Miller-Kennedy plan. For example, if a senior spends $4,000 on prescription drugs, she would reach the catastrophic limit and all additional drug expenses would be covered under this proposal. Seniors will not lose their current employer retirement coverage and will not have to rely on the public benefits provided by the plan. There also would not be a asset test required for participation in the Graham-Miller-Kennedy program.The competing amendment proposed by the Senator from Iowa is well intended, but the Grassley amendment would not provide adequate coverage for seniors. The Grassley amendment would result in 26,000 seniors in Hawaii losing their existing retirement coverage, 47,000 seniors and disabled Medicare beneficiaries in Hawaii would fall into the benefit hole and would have to continue paying premiums and paying higher drug costs while not receiving any benefits. The Grassley amendment would also include a means test to qualify for additional assistance that would prevent seniors with assets greater than $4,000 from qualifying for additional assistance.Today, the Senate has a historic opportunity to provide seniors with the missing piece of health care coverage that is urgently needed. We must ensure that all seniors are provided with an affordable and comprehensive prescription drug benefit for all seniors. I urge my colleagues to support the plan which does this, the Medicare Outpatient Prescription Drug Act.",

    "text": "Mr. President. Today I rise to introduce legislation reauthorizing the Office of Special Counsel, OSC, and the Merit Systems Protection Board, MSPB. These two agencies safeguard the merit system principles and protect Federal employees who step forward to disclose government waste, fraud, and abuse.The Office of Special Counsel protects Federal employees and applicants from reprisal for whistleblowing and other prohibited personnel practices. OSC serves as a safe and secure channel for Federal workers who wish to disclose violations of law, gross mismanagement or waste of funds, abuse of authority, and a specific danger to the public health and safety. In addition, OSC enforces and provides advisory opinions regarding the Hatch Act, which restricts the political activities of Federal employees. It also protects the rights of Federal employee, military veterans and reservists under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994.The Merit Systems Protection Board monitors the Federal Government's merit-based system of employment by hearing and deciding appeals from Federal employees regarding job removal and other major personnel actions. The Board also decides other types of civil service cases, reviews regulations of the Office of Personnel Management, and conducts studies of the merit systems. Together, OSC and MSPB act as stalwarts of justice for the dedicated men and women who serve the public.In addition to reauthorizing these two important agencies, my bill would restore congressional intent regarding who is entitled to relief under the Whistleblower Protection Act, WPA. On several occasions, Congress has had to revisit the WPA to close loopholes in the law. Congress has been forced to specify that ``any'' disclosure truly means ``any'' disclosure. This is regardless of the setting of the disclosure, the form of the disclosure, or the person to whom the disclosure is made.Since Congress amended the WPA in 1994, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which has sole jurisdiction over the WPA, has continued to disregard clear statutory language that the Act covers disclosures such as those made to supervisors, to possible wrongdoers, or as part of an employee's job duties.In order to protect the statute's foundation that `any' lawful disclosure that an employee or applicant reasonably believes is credible evidence of waste, fraud, abuse, or gross mismanagement is covered by the WPA, language in this bill codifies the repeated and unconditional statements of congressional intent and legislative history. It specifically covers any disclosure of information without restriction to time, place, form, motive, or context, or prior disclosure made to any person by an employee or applicant, including a disclosure made in the ordinary course of an employee's duties, that the employee or applicant reasonably believes is evidence of any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or other misconduct specified.The bill also addresses another burden created by the Federal Circuit not found in the Whistleblower Protection Act. In interpreting the meaning of `reasonable belief,' the Federal Circuit held that the reasonableness of the whistleblower's belief that the government violated the law or engaged in gross mismanagement must first begin with a presumption that public officers performed their duties correctly, fairly, in good faith, and in accordance with the law. However, this presumption can only be overcome by ``irrefragable proof'' to the contrary. The irrefragable standard is impossible to overcome and has a chilling effect on those who would disclose government wrongdoing. As such, this new provision states that any presumption that a public officer has performed their duties in good faith must be overcome by substantial evidence.My bill also codifies an ``anti-gag'' provision that Congress has passed annually since 1988 as part of its appropriations process. The yearly appropriations language bars agencies from implementing or enforcing any nondisclosure policy, form, or agreement that does not contain specified language preserving open government statutes such as the WPA, the Military Whistleblower Protection Act, and the Lloyd Lafollette Act, which prohibits discrimination against government employees who communicate with Congress. Moreover, Congress unanimously has supported the concept that Federal employees should not be subject to restraint nor suffer retaliation for disclosing wrongdoing.Now more than ever, Federal employees must feel comfortable coming forward with information concerning violations of law or actions that could cause substantial harm to public safety. We must support the brave men and women who come forward to report wrongdoing. We must ensure that such acts of bravery are not rewarded with retaliation.Protection of Federal whistleblowers is a bipartisan effort. Enactment of the original bill in 1989 and the 1994 amendments enjoyed unanimous bicameral and bipartisan support. More recently, Senators Levin and Grassley joined me in introducing S. 995, which makes many of the same amendments to the WPA as this bill. I urge my colleagues to join with me in clarifying the WPA and supporting the reauthorization of two very important agencies.At this time I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.",

    "title": "HOMELAND SECURITY ACT OF 2002",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to commend my chairman, Senator Lieberman, for his outstanding work and his extraordinary leadership in the committee, and to mention that it was after Senator Lieberman began his initiative to create such a Department that it began to pick up, not only in the Senate but with the administration, too. He has crafted, I believe, a strong piece of legislation for the Department of Homeland Security.This evening I rise to express my strong support for Senator Lieberman's substitute. I have strong respect for the senior Senator from West Virginia but I will vote against his amendment. Senator Lieberman has done a great service to his country by holding hearings and debating extensively the structure of a Department of Homeland Security. Without his determined effort, the President might never have conceded the need for such a department. As Senator Thompson has noted, the Governmental Affairs Committee debated in great deal the structure of such a department. Numerous changes were made to the President's proposal which have substantially improved it.I rise to discuss the flexibilities available at the Federal Aviation Administration and the Internal Revenue Service. My colleagues have criticized the legislation before us for not providing the same flexibilities available to the FAA and the IRS. The most important factor in the personnel systems at these two agencies is the involvement of federal employee unions.In April 1996, at Congressional direction, FAA was allowed to develop its own personnel and compensation systems, to give the agency more flexibility because of its daily interaction with the fast-paced and rapidly-growing aviation industry. The Secretary of Transportation argued strongly that the agency needed flexibility to pay people what the job required and to move them where the work was needed, without the restrictions of standard government personnel procedures.While the FAA was given wide authority to develop their personnel system, the FAA still must negotiate with its federal employee unions in developing and making changes to the personnel management system. The FAA system contains provisions protecting a large portion of the rights of federal workers. These include whistleblower protections, including the provisions for investigation and enforcement; veterans' preference; anti-discrimination; compensation for work injury; retirement, unemployment compensation, and insurance coverage; and review of employee matters by the Merit Systems Protection Board.In addition, employees subject to major adverse personnel actions may contest the action through any contractual grievance procedure.And because the FAA is not subject to federal pay rate regulations, the federal employee unions are allowed to bargain over wages at the FAA as they do in the private sector.Such bargaining rights are not provided in the President's original Homeland Security bill or the House passed bill. In fact, both bills would allow even current collective bargaining rights to be waived.Despite this praise of FAA flexibility, just last year, the Republican-led House Appropriations Committee concluded that FAA's personnel reform has been a failure. At that time, the most recent FAA employee attitude survey showed severe levels of employee dissatisfaction, even as compensation levels rose to make DOT the highest-paid cabinet level agency in the Federal Government.Fewer than one in ten employees felt that personnel reform had been successful at eliminating bureaucracy or helping accomplish FAA's mission. Fewer than one in five felt the agency rewards creativity and innovation--even though personnel reform allows the agency great flexibility in this area.A review of staffing at air traffic control facilities indicates that reform has not been used to place employees where they are needed. These findings were supported by an independent study conducted by the National Academy of Public Administration, which found that FAA hasn't met many of the key goals of personnel reform.In addition, the House Committee believed that Congress should carefully review the effects of personnel reform leading up to reauthorization of AIR 21 in fiscal year 2004 to gauge whether the experiment should be continued.According to the GAO, the decentralized personnel structure that resulted from FAA's reform has caused moral problems, communication gaps and inconsistencies in technical advice and leadership within FAA organizations, and insufficient understanding throughout the workforce about the intent of reforms. As a result of these problems, FAA lacks a broad base of support and accountability for reform initiatives among employees below the highest management levels.More recently, TSA, which uses the FAA's pay banding system, has caused great concern with the high salaries given to federal law enforcement officers that are higher than those currently earned at other federal agencies. Such a system has contributed to the loss of law enforcement officers at the Capitol Police, the U.S. Park Police and the U.S. Secret Service.The IRS was granted additional flexibilities to address its unique workforce as well. The IRS personnel flexibilities include: critical pay authority; enhanced recruitment, retention, and relocation authority; enhanced authority for performance awards to senior executives; and exceptions to Title 5 rules in filling Senior Executive Service positions which are reserved for career employees.Additional flexibilities are granted to the IRS which can only be applied to union represented employees subject to a written agreement between the union and the IRS. This includes streamlined demonstration project authority; variations to the performance appraisal and awards sections of Title 5; variations from Title 5 pay and classification systems for pay banding; and variations from Title 5 hiring rules.However, the IRS' progress on reform seems welcome to all but those who work inside the agency. In response to the agency's 2001 employee climate survey, 42 percent of employees said the organizational changes have had a negative effect on them, compared with 24 percent who reported positive effects and 34 percent who reported no effect. Such dissatisfaction does nothing to help retain employees when the federal government is facing a human capital crisis.While there has been an increase in customer satisfaction with the IRS, the widespread personnel reshuffling has yet to guarantee that the IRS is matching its workforce to its workload appropriately. Over the past four years, the backlog of taxpayer requests for compromise settlements with the IRS on the amount of back taxes they owe tripled, even though the staff devoted to the backlog has doubled. A General Accounting Office review found that putting staff on the compromise program may be hurting other collection programs. The large percentage of bad information given to taxpayers by IRS employees also shows that the right people with the right skills are not in place in customer service jobs--though the IRS is retraining customer service representatives to improve accuracy.As we are debating the creation of a new Department of Homeland Security, we must make sure that providing new flexibilities does not compromise the mission of the agency. In providing the agency with the tools to effectively manage their workforce, we must make sure that agencies have a strategy in place to meet their missions and keep employees satisfied. If our dedicated workers do not feel valuable to the agency, the mission will fail. Without sufficient union participation and civil service protections, our homeland will not be secure.Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "title": "THE ECONOMY",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern over the current state of the economy. Too many working Americans are confronted with difficult financial situations due to the slowdown in the economy. I continue to believe in economic education and financial literacy as a major part of the solution for people to improve their unique situations. However, such efforts cannot truly succeed without sound fiscal policies to keep our economy strong. Many American families are having difficulties making ends meet. Over two million jobs have been lost since January 2001. The unemployment rate for September was 5.6 percent, an increase from the 3.9 percent unemployment rate in September and October of 2000. Home foreclosures are occurring at the fastest rate in thirty years and others are falling behind on their payments. Health care costs have increased rapidly. As a result, many are paying substantially more for their insurance coverage. Rising prescription drug costs have made it costly to obtain necessary medication, particularly for seniors.I agree with the Majority Leader in his prescription for the sick economy. Unemployment insurance must be extended to help those who are still struggling to find work in these tough economic times. An estimated 1.5 million people exhausted their Federal extended unemployment benefits by the end of September. The total for the end of the year is expected to rise to 2.2 million individuals.The minimum wage needs to be increased. Since establishing the minimum wage requirement in 1938, we have had only 19 increases in the minimum wage. The latest occurred in September 1997. The earnings of average Americans have grown little, and the overall distribution of income has become increasingly unequal. The real value of the minimum wage has fallen by 11 percent since the last increase. Currently, a minimum wage employee working full time earns about $4,000 below the poverty line for a family of three. We need to increase the minimum wage to help those millions of Americans earning the minimum wage who are rapidly becoming a permanent underclass in our society.The savings of Americans have been ravaged in the last few years. The reduction in the value of retirement accounts is particularly troubling because Americans will have a harder time achieving the goal of a comfortable retirement. Over $210 billion in 401(k) and other defined contribution plans was lost in 2001. Individual Retirement Accounts lost over $230 billion in 2001.Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, and other criminally managed companies have shaken the markets after the accounting scandals and disclosure of corporate misdeeds. We need the Securities and Exchange Commission to be aggressive in its pursuit of fraud and corporate malfeasance.Without trust, our markets and economy cannot effectively function. The Sarbanes corporate accountability legislation that passed this summer will help provide additional safeguards for investors. With the recent addition of the new Securities and Exchange Commissioners, I look forward to the development of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. It is my hope that the organization will become a friend and advocate for the investor--not the accounting industry. The corporate accountability bill must be strongly enforced. In addition, pension protection legislation needs to be enacted to empower workers to make it easier for them to sell company stock and to make their investments more secure.It is troubling that revenues have declined when there are so many domestic and defense needs. The 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut, which was enacted in June 2001, has contributed to a rapid surge in the size of the Federal budget deficit. The FY 2002 budget deficit is now estimated to be $157 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office's monthly budget review. Gone are the years of budget surpluses. Although some of this can be attributed to necessary spending for national security in the wake of September 11, 2001, we cannot ignore the overall impact of last year's tax cut package. We must reexamine the tax cuts that have yet to take effect. The tax cuts were enacted at a time when the economy appeared stronger, there was a Federal budget surplus, and the tragic events of September 11 had not yet occurred. Now, fiscal responsibility requires all options to be on the table, such as postponing or canceling specific upper income tax cuts. I know that some of my colleagues share my concerns, and I look forward to working with them on this issue.The American people will pay a large price for the tax cuts that generally are for the wealthiest Americans. When fully implemented, the tax cuts will give more tax breaks to the top one percent of taxpayers than to the combined total of the bottom 80 percent. It will be extremely difficult to pay down the public debt, which at the end of FY 2002 was estimated to be $3.6 trillion. It also will be difficult to provide a meaningful Medicare prescription drug benefit for seniors, and to adequately fund education and other vital programs and services.Unfortunately, there are those who want to further compound our fiscal crisis by making the tax cuts permanent. Responsible fiscal policy is needed, or possible adverse effects, such as increasing interest rates, may further weaken the economy. Prior to the enactment of the tax cuts, the public debt was expected to be eliminated by 2009. This is no longer true. Future generations of taxpayers will be stuck paying the bill for these current tax cuts, and the picture would look even worse if the cuts are made permanent.As a former classroom teacher and principal, I would like to say another word about education, which is one of the most important responsibilities we have regarding our children and our nation's future. The No Child Left Behind Act became law in January of this year. This sweeping reform of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act places before our schools dramatic mandates that they improve student performance or face tough consequences. The FY 2003 budget request, rather than including the funding needed to properly implement changes in the Act, requested the smallest increase in education spending in seven years. Furthermore, the budget request included education cuts of $1.76 billion, which would eliminate 40 programs and cut an additional 16. I am thankful to my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee for restoring much of this funding. Going forward, we must continue to use fiscal restraint, but we must balance this with the need to invest in critical priorities.I look forward to working with my colleagues on initiatives to encourage job growth, provide assistance for workers who have lost their jobs, and help alleviate the economic strain that has impacted most Americans. I urge all of my colleagues to add their energies to these efforts.",

    "title": "TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PAUL WELLSTONE",
    "text": "Mr. President, as the 107th Congress nears its conclusion, I rise to join my colleagues in remembering our beloved colleague, Senator Paul Wellstone. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Wellstone family, Paul's staff, and the people of Minnesota. We are all saddened by the tragic deaths of Paul and Sheila Wellstone, their daughter, Marcia Wellstone Markuson, and the Wellstone staffers and pilots.America will sorely miss Paul Wellstone and his passionate advocacy on behalf of those in our communities and our country who too often feel that no one in Washington hears their voice. Paul Wellstone was their voice, he was their champion, driven by his unwavering conviction that government can and should be a force for good in people's lives. Paul was a caring, persistent, and passionate advocate for veterans, children, the mentally ill, and working families. He was committed to ensuring that all Americans had the opportunity to make a better life for themselves and their families, and that wherever possible, government act as a positive instrument to advance opportunity and equality for all Americans in education, job training, access to health care, and the availability of quality health care. He was driven by his commitment to civil rights and equal justice. Whether speaking on the Senate floor or to a workers' rally, retracing Robert F. Kennedy's tour of America's poorest communities, or visiting veterans hospitalized in Minnesota, Paul lived his convictions and values. Whether you agreed or disagreed with Paul Wellstone on an issue, there was never any doubt about his integrity, the passion and commitment he brought to his work, and the deep pride he felt in serving the people of Minnesota in the Senate.Paul and I were both first elected to the Senate in November 1990. I had been appointed to the Senate a few months earlier, but we were both the new kids on the block. From the outset, with his incandescent personality, exacting integrity, commitment to the values he espoused and the ability to speak passionately and eloquently about the issues he cared so deeply about Paul distinguished himself as an exceptional Senator and an extraordinary human being.Over the course of his tenure in the Senate, Paul became a dear friend. Because of the chronic discomfort he experienced as a consequence of his lifetime love of the sport of wrestling, he was interested in my experiences with hip replacement surgery. At the start of the 107th Congress, our offices were next to one another. His boundless energy, enthusiasm, and good spirits were always welcome and brightened the day for everyone he greeted on his way to and from his office. I remember one conversation on a long bus ride back from a Democratic retreat in Pennsylvania. My eldest son, Danny, had joined Millie and me for the weekend, and he struck up a quick friendship with Paul and Sheila. Over the course of ride back to Washington, we discussed philosophy and politics, the upcoming midterm elections, destiny, and the power of living in consonance with your values and beliefs. I listened as Paul and my son agreed on the importance of living life to the fullest and living every day as if it is your last. That day stays with me because that is precisely the way Paul Wellstone lived his life. He celebrated life. He loved his job and his constituents. He adored Sheila and his children and grandchildren. He always made the time to greet, talk to, or offer words of encouragement to everyone he encountered as he went about his day. To me, this is Paul's greatest legacy, the lives he touched, the people he inspired, the spirits he lifted with his message of hope and justice.Paul had hoped to visit Hawaii after the November election and had spoken to my son Danny about bringing his entire family for some well-deserved rest and relaxation. Paul and Sheila never had the opportunity to visit Hawaii with their children and grandchildren as we talked about, but they truly lived aloha. For aloha is love. And love is the spirit that brings people together in harmony. In its true sense, aloha has to be transmitted to others, especially to each other, and aloha really is in the giving, not the taking. When you give, you are sharing aloha. This is how Paul and Sheila Wellstone lived their lives and it is why we in the Senate family miss Paul and Sheila terribly. I want to bid Paul and Sheila Wellstone a fond aloha. May God bless them and the Wellstone family. Na Iehowa 'oe e ho'omaika'i mai, a e malama mai--The Lord bless you and keep you.",

    "title": "TRIBUTE TO THE SPACE SHUTTLE ``COLUMBIA'' ASTRONAUTS",
    "text": "Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues on this sad and solemn afternoon to honor the lives of our brave astronaut heroes: the seven crew members of the Space Shuttle Columbia who were lost Saturday morning on their return from a 16-day scientific mission in outer space.As we honor the memory of the Columbia crew, Shuttle Commander Rick Husband, Pilot William McCool, Payload Commander Michael Anderson, Mission Specialist Kalpana Chawla, Mission Specialist David Brown, Mission Specialist Laurel Clark, and Payload Specialist Ilan Ramon, I send my heartfelt sympathy to their families and loved ones.This is a national and international tragedy that has brought people and nations around the globe together in grief and remembrance. The men and women onboard the Columbia epitomized the best and brightest our country has to offer, and the participation of other nations in the shuttle program illustrates the collaboration and interconnection between America and other nations in the peaceful exploration of space and progress of scientific inquiry. The Columbia crew, like most of the men and women in our space program, came to NASA as successful and respected leaders from their respective professions. As scientists, doctors, surgeons, aviators, and military officers, they sought to share their expertise in the service of our Nation and mankind. In the decades since Sputnik and John Glenn's orbital mission of the earth in the Friendship 7, people around the world have been fascinated with possibilities of space exploration. The shuttle program opened the reality of space exploration to astronauts from many nations and caught the interest of young people around the world.Colonel Ramon, Israel's first astronaut and one of his nation's premier air force pilots, captured the imagination of the Israeli people. His participation in the shuttle program stirred a great sense of pride and hope in a nation that has endured so much conflict and violence over the past two years. Dr. Kalpana Chawla, the first Indian-born woman to go into space, is a national heroine in India and a great inspiration to young people in both that land of her birth and her adopted home, especially young women and girls who saw Dr. Chawla as a role model for the possibilities and opportunities available to them.As we mourn the loss of these brave individuals, men and women who willingly assumed the risk of space travel in their dedication to science and the expansion of human knowledge to new frontiers, we are reminded of the human spirit for exploration and discovery. Indeed, the quintessential trait of the American national character is the sense of adventure and curiosity that led pioneers and homesteaders westward, impelled men and women in Europe and Asia to emigrate to a new, vast, and unknown Nation with only the promise of opportunity and prosperity, and embraced President Kennedy's challenge to put a man on the moon.America has been peopled by men and women driven by this spirit, and it is a quality we greatly admire and respect in our leaders and fellow citizens. The crew of the Columbia fully understood that there are many dangers associated with space flight, but looked beyond them while seeking to bring forth wisdom and reason from the vast unknown through space exploration and research. The crew understood that the experiments they were conducting on a wide array of medical and scientific subjects held the promise of major scientific advancements and benefit to mankind.In the coming weeks and months, we must investigate what caused this tragedy and ensure that manned space flight is safe for our men and women who dedicate their lives to space exploration. As we scour the earth for answers to this tragedy, we must not lose sight of the heavens, or allow our fascination with exploring, discovering, or dreaming to wane. For by reaffirming our resolve to explore the wonders and mysteries of the universe, we honor the memory of the Columbia's crew, and the memory of all those astronauts who lost their lives in our Nation's endeavor to understand outer space.I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "title": "STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS",
    "text": "Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to speak on the Low Income Taxpayer Protection Act of 2003, which Senator Bingaman and I are introducing today. I thank Senator Bingaman for his leadership on this important issue.The legislation that my colleague from New Mexico and I are introducing would provide the Department of the Treasury with the authority to regulate income tax refund anticipation loans, RALs, and prohibit excessive fees. The bill would also provide additional opportunities for low-income taxpayers to receive assistance with tax preparation and filing their taxes and thus, we are seeking to meet taxpayers' needs for assistance while attempting to discourage a predatory practice.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2001, the Earned Income Tax Credit, EITC, was responsible for elevating nearly four million people above the poverty line. This credit has helped and continues to help low-income individuals and families to meet their food, clothing, housing, transportation, and education needs.However, while this tax relief is benefitting families who need it most, the EITC's impact is being unnecessarily limited. Earned Income Tax Credit benefits intended for working families are increasingly being diminished by often exorbitant tax preparation fees and the growing use of high-interest refund anticipation loans, which typically carry triple-digit interest rates.In 1999, according to a report published by the Brookings Institution, an estimated $1.75 billion intended to assist low-income families went to commercial tax preparers and affiliated national banks for tax assistance, electronic filing of returns, and high-cost refund loans. Although tax preparation services are useful, when combined with refund anticipation loans and other fees, these services are overpriced. The report further stated that 39 percent of taxpayers who earned the EITC received their refund through a refund anticipation loan, while only four percent of those who did not receive the EITC purchased a refund anticipation loan. Clearly, RALs were heavily marketed to a specific population of taxpayer. Forty-seven percent of all EITC dollars were distributed to recipients through these loans. In my state of Hawaii, in the Honolulu metropolitan statistical area, 27.7 percent of all EITC dollars were associated with refund anticipation loans. These loans take money away from the day-to-day, kitchen-table needs of the low-income families.Furthermore, refund anticipation loans carry interest rates that range from 97.4 percent to more than 2,000 percent. The interest rates and fees charged on these products are not justified for the short length of time that these loans cover. The typical rapid refund loan length is two weeks. These loans carry even less risk because of the Debt Indicator program. The Debt Indicator program allows the Internal Revenue Service to inform the lender if the applicant for a refund loan has any outstanding Federal debts. The risk is further reduced because loan issuers share information about outstanding delinquencies that refund anticipation loan applicants owe and are able to collect debts for each other.This bill would terminate the Debt Indicator program. In 1995, the use of the Debt Indicator was suspended because of massive fraud in e-filed returns with RALs. After the program was discontinued, RAL participation declined. The use of the Debt Indicator was reinstated in 1999. Remarks from H &amp; R Block Chief Executive Officer Frank L. Salizzoni upon the reinstatement of the program state that the Debt Indicator ``is good news for many of our clients who opt to receive the amount of their refund through Refund Anticipation Loans. The IRS program will likely result in substantially lower fees for this service.'' However, according to a study conducted by the Consumer Federation of America and the National Consumer Law Center, that has not been the case for at least one of the major tax preparers. H &amp; R Block and Household Bank's fees dropped for a year after the Debt Indicator was reinstated. The fees rose significantly from 2000 to 2001, which increased H &amp; R Block's revenue from RALs by 49 percent. Per RAL revenue rose by 43.9 percent while RAL sales volume increased by only 2.7 percent. The expected outcome that RAL prices would go down as a result of the reinstatement of the indicator has not occurred. The use of the Debt Indicator should again be stopped.Another important provision in the bill is authorization language for a grant program to link tax preparation services with the establishment of a bank account. There are still approximately four million EITC recipients that are classified as unbanked, and lack a formal relationship with a financial institution. It has been estimated that 45 percent of EITC recipients pay for check cashing services. These check cashing services reduce EITC benefits by $130 million. Having a bank account allows individuals not only to receive their tax refund check faster than waiting for a paper check, but also does not impose the excessive fees that check cashing services and refund anticipation loan providers assess. An account at a bank or credit union provides consumers alternatives to rapid refund loans, check cashing services, and lower cost remittances. In addition, bank and credit union accounts provide access to saving and borrowing services found at mainstream financial institutions. This grant program builds upon the First Accounts initiative which has funded pilot projects that have coupled tax preparation services with the establishment of bank accounts. An example of such a project is the partnership that has been established among The Center for Law &amp; Human Services, Accounting Aid Society, ShoreBank, National Consumer Law Center, and Consumer Federation of America that is taking place in Chicago and Detroit. More of these programs are necessary to provide much needed tax preparation assistance and to encourage the use of mainstream financial services. By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Inouye):S. 686. A bill to provide assistance for poison prevention and to stabilize the funding of regional poison control centers; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues--Senators Murray, Landrieu, Breaux, Bingaman, and Inouye--to introduce the Poison Control Center Awareness and Enhancement Act of 2003. Our bill is designed to help make certain that the vital work of our nation's poison control centers continues.Many of us--as parents and grandparents--have experienced the terrifying situation when a child accidentally swallows something potentially toxic. Fortunately, local poison control centers--many of them located at children's hospitals--work around the clock to answer questions from parents and to field phone calls from others about possible poisonings. Today, we also have in place a national, toll-free poison control telephone number--and that number is 1-800-222-1222--that automatically connects callers to specially trained nurses, pharmacists, and doctors at the closest local poison center.This phone number went into effect as a result of legislation I helped get signed into law a few years ago. And now, as parents of eight children and now grandparents of eight, my wife, Fran, and I can tell you that we rest a bit easier knowing that in the case of a possible poisoning, all we need to do is call a toll free, 1-800 telephone number to get in contact with the nearest poison control center. Any parents, anywhere--whether they are in their own hometown or in another state on vacation--can call the 1-800 number, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in the event of a poisoning.There are over 70 poison control centers nationwide--three in my home State of Ohio. These centers have fielded over one million phone calls just since January 2002, answering questions about poisonous, drug abuse, product contents, substance identification interactions, and adverse reactions. They can answer questions and concerns about what would typically be called poisonous products--things like cleaners and bleach. This is the most common poison exposure for children, who typically ingest household products, such as cosmetics and personal care products, cleaning substances, pain relievers, foreign bodies, and plants.But poison control centers can also answer questions about products that people may not think are poisonous, like prescribed medicines or over-the-counter medications. Maybe someone mixed medications or misread a label and took too much of the medicine by accident. Poison control centers can answer caller questions and direct the caller to seek medical attention if necessary.I remember very clearly a time when Fran and I needed to call the local poison control center. As we were wrapping up our annual Ice Cream Social at our home in Cedarville, our then two year-old granddaughter, Isabelle, fell into a bucket of cleaning solution. We feared that she may have swallowed some of the solution and immediately called the poison control center. We were very lucky. The trained health care professional at the local poison center explained that all we needed to do was rinse Isabelle off and have her drink some water. The quick response of the poison control center provided rapid, easy answers to our questions--a process that has become even easier since the toll-free hotline began operating.A young child, like Isabelle, is representative of most poisoning cases; however, adults often face situations necessitating information and help from poison control centers. Take the example of what occurred in Marysville, OH. Thirty workers in a manufacturing plant in Marysville were victims of gas exposure. Twenty of these workers went to Union Memorial Hospital. The hospital contacted the poison center, after which these patients were given oxygen and later discharged that same day. Ten others went to a different hospital that did not call a poison center. These patients were not released until the next day, even though their symptoms did not differ from the other 20 workers. The national hotline will help cut-down on situations like that in Marysville. Our Nation's poison control centers handle an average of one poison exposure every 15 seconds. These centers are critical to our communities--especially now during this time of war and uncertainty. Parents are already anxious about the safety of their children, and with the potential anthrax scares or chemical or biologic scares, poison control centers can provide information to parents and help relieve some of their concerns.The bill we are introducing today would provide the continued funding needed to ensure that the national toll-free number continues to operate, taking phone calls and helping families across the country. We must continue to increase the accessibility and effectiveness of our nation's poison control centers, as well as cement their existence for future generations. With this bill, we are not just making an investment in poison control; rather, we are making it easier to keep our children, friends, and ourselves safer and healthier.I encourage my colleagues to remember the hotline number--it could save a life: 1-800-222-1222.I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,This Act may be cited as the ``Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act Amendments of 2003''.Section 2 of the Poison Control Enhancement and Awareness Act (42 U.S.C. 14801) is amended to read as follows:Section 2 of the Poison Control Enhancement and Awareness Act (42 U.S.C. 14801) is amended to read as follows: ``SEC. 2.

    "text": "Madam President, I rise to join my colleagues in honoring the memory of our dear friend and colleague, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Millie and I extend our deepest condolences and prayers to his wife Elizabeth and the Moynihan family.History will remember Daniel Patrick Moynihan as one of the most prescient American voices on public policy and international relations issues for the second half of the 20th Century. As a professor, author, adviser to four Presidents, Ambassador to India, and Ambassador to the United Nations, he had a rich and distinguished career, and a tremendous impact on our Nation's public policy and foreign relations, prior to his election to the Senate.In the Senate, Pat Moynihan's illustrious service to his country and to his constituents in New York for four terms in the world's greatest deliberative body gave greater truth to that appellation. Many of my colleagues have spoken of Senator Moynihan's intellect, the encyclopedic width and breadth of his knowledge on an incredible range of public policy issues--history, architecture, culture, and philosophy, to name a few. He used the power of his intellect, along with great wit and dogged persistence, to fashion a record of accomplishments in the Senate that stands as a testament to his commitment to the preservation of the family and the welfare of children and the poor, his staunch and principled opposition to communism and totalitarianism, his dedication to civil rights, the Constitution, and the rules and traditions of the Senate, and his passion for historic preservation and architectural distinction.As chairman and ranking member of several Senate committees, and frequently, as a clarion on the Senate floor, Pat Moynihan helped shape transportation policy, international trade, intelligence matters, foreign policy, and economic and fiscal affairs that strengthened our Nation and our communities. For his myriad achievements, I don't think Senator Moynihan has received the credit he deserves for his role in shaping and shepherding through the Senate President Clinton's deficit reduction and economic plan in 1993. I remember that in the midst of all the responsibilities and pressures he faced as chairman of the Finance Committee, he responded to my request to discuss a few tax issues of particular importance to Hawaii by inviting me to his office for a cordial and illuminating discussion on an array of subjects. Pat Moynihan was always generous with his time and his wisdom. He served his country and the people of New York with elan, style, and grace. He will always be remembered as the gentleman from New York.We mourn for his passing from this life, but we and future generations will continue to find inspiration, guidance, and courage in the splendid legacy of public service bequeathed the Nation by this brilliant statesman and patriot.",

    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the team of students from Kahuku High and Intermediate School of Kahuku, HI, on logging yet another bright performance for their school at the ``We the People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution'' national competition recently held here in our Nation's Capital. The team traveled over 5,000 miles to represent Hawaii in this competition, and won the Unit 3 award, ``How the Values and Principles Embodied in the Constitution Shaped American Institutions and Practices,'' for the second consecutive year. On behalf of the people of Hawaii, I am proud to congratulate the Kahuku team.As my colleagues are familiar, the We the People competition, administered by the Center for Civic Education, is a comprehensive program that assists students in understanding the history and principles of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. The academic competition simulates a congressional hearing where students, acting as expert witnesses, testify before a panel of prominent professionals from across the country to demonstrate their knowledge of constitutional issues. The program provides an excellent opportunity for students to gain an appreciation of the significance of our Constitution and its place in history and our lives today. As a former teacher, it heartens me to see our young people taking interest in learning about the sacred document which we in this Chamber work to uphold and defend, every day. It is only through the understanding of our Constitution and the Bill of Rights that we are able to perpetuate the democratic foundation upon which this great Nation was built. I applaud all students who participate in this competition for their hard work and dedication to civic education. We might well have future Senators and Members of Congress who are encouraged to enter public service because of their experiences in the We the People competition.I am pleased to enter the names of the Kahuku team members for the record: Adriana Alghussein, Daniel Allen, Dexter Bacon, Nicole Cameron, Ariane Cameros, Li Shieh Chen, Anthony Ching, William Ellis, Brooke Jones, Shantel Kaululaau, April Kekaula, Helene Keys, Malia Love, Leilani Miller, Andrew Savini, Jessica Schiaretti, Kristen Sickler, Bethany Smith, Ericka Staples, and Elizabeth Torres. I also take this opportunity to recognize their teacher Sandra Cashman, State Coordinator Lyla Berg, and District Coordinator Sharon Kaohi for all of their contributions in helping the Kahuku team prepare for the national competition.Again, I congratulate the students and the faculty of Kahuku High and Intermediate School for their outstanding achievements. I am pleased to note that a team from this school has represented Hawaii in 9 of the past 11 national competitions. I join the people of Hawaii in expressing my pride in their impressive achievement.

    "title": "SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 44--RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICANS TO OUR NATION",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to recognize our country's diverse Asian American and Pacific Islander, AAPI, population and commemorate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. I add my voice to those in the AAPI community recognizing and celebrating the unique contributions of this diverse community by submitting a resolution similar to that submitted in the other body by fellow members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.It was more than 10 years ago when my friend and former colleague, Congressman Frank Horton of New York, took the important step of introducing and working to pass a bill to designate each May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, in perpetuity. His bill eventually became Public Law 102-450 on October 23, 1992. This was a single, important step to demonstrate the support of the Congress for a community that has always been a vital part of our Nation's heritage.Historians note that the first Asians or Pacific Islanders to set foot on the continental United States were Filipinos manning Spanish galleons that sought to explore the new land in the 1500s. Filipino sailors later, in the 1700s, founded the first AAPI communities in the Louisiana bayous, using names such as Manila Village and Bayou Cholas. The first Japanese arrived on May 7, 1843, and others in 1869 attempted to establish the Wakamatsu Tea and Silk Colony, in order to grow mulberries, tangerines, grapes, and tea. Chinese adventurers joined other gold-seekers in northern California in the 1800s, establishing the now-famous Chinatown in San Francisco in the 1850s, and working toward the establishment of the first transcontinental railroad--marked by Golden Spike Day, May 10, 1869. Of course, before all of this took place, the indigenous peoples most known to me, the Native Hawaiians, established a vibrant society, living and working the lands from roughly the 1200s on what was to become the 50th State in our precious Union. Prior to western contact, the Native Hawaiians lived in an advanced society steeped in science. The many other peoples in what is known now as the collective AAPI community have their own fascinating stories to tell about their first adventures and long heritage in America.Advancing through history to come to the present, the AAPI community has grown so much from our years of ``firsts'' that it now numbers about 13.5 million--12.5 million Asians and almost one million Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders. Together, AAPIs make up roughly 4.7 percent of the population. Even with this growth in overall size, we have remained inclusive of our various cultures and celebrated the positives among our differences as well as lauded our similarities. Indeed, my colleagues can certainly describe their favorite Korean, Thai, or Indian restaurants, or strive to distinguish one of our many languages from another, while acknowledging the major significance we collectively assign to educational access and attainment, service to the communities we live in, and deep-rooted family values. It is also prudent to note that AAPIs together continue to strive toward eliminating civil injustice and increasing our political involvement and participation in government, while looking to care for individuals in our community who deny the stereotype of AAPIs as a ``model minority''--those who are not faring as well as others and continue to live below the poverty level or fail to reach their full potential in school or in the workforce. It is not only for AAPIs but for all of us in this great country that I firmly believe that our individual identification and knowledge of our cultures of origin strengthen us when we come together as Americans. It is out of our many, glorious parts that we come together to make one shining whole. Thus, the celebration of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month truly is about all of us.I urge my colleagues to support me in this resolution.",

    "title": "PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND MEDICARE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2003",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise in support of my amendment to restore a Medicaid disproportionate share hospital, DSH, allotment for Hawaii. Medicaid DSH payments are designed to provide additional support to hospitals that treat large numbers of Medicaid and uninsured patients.The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, BBA, created specific DSH allotments for each State based on each their actual DSH expenditures for fiscal year 1995. In 1994, the State of Hawaii implemented the QUEST demonstration program that was designed to reduce the number of uninsured and improve access to health care. The prior Medicaid DSH program was incorporated into QUEST. As a result of the demonstration program, Hawaii did not have DSH expenditures in 1995 and was not provided a DSH allotment.The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 made further changes to the DSH program, which included the establishment of a flood for DSH allotments. However, States without allotments were again left out. Other States that have obtained waivers similar to Hawaii's have retained their DSH allotments. Only two States, Hawaii and Tennessee, do not have DSH allotments.As currently drafted, S. 1 provides that States without DSH allotments could obtain an allotment if their waiver was terminated or removed. It is my understanding that while this language would permit an allotment for Tennessee, it would prevent Hawaii from obtaining its DSH allotment as long as the QUEST program remains in place.My amendment would provide a DSH allotment to Hawaii and allow for my home State to participate in the Medicaid DSH program. This amendment is needed because many of our hospitals in Hawaii are struggling to meet the elevated demands placed upon them by the increasing number of uninsured people. DSH payments will help Hawaii hospitals meet the rising health care needs of our communities and reinforce our health care safety net. All 50 States need to have access to Medicaid DSH support.My amendment is similar to language included in the Senate passed version of S. 2, the Jobs and Growth Tax Act of 2003, that would have provided assistance to low DSH States and would have provided an allotment for Hawaii. Unfortunately, the DSH provisions were not retained in the conference report. A Hawaii specific provision is necessary as we attempt to provide additional support for hospitals in low DSH States in this legislation.I appreciate all of the work done by my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, to provide additional support for low DSH States. I urge that my colleagues support this amendment to allow the State of Hawaii to be treated like other extremely low DSH States and finally receive a Medicaid DSH allotment.",

    "title": "PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND MEDICARE IMPROVEMENT ACT",
    "text": "Madam President, I rise today to speak on S. 1, the Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003.For far too long Medicare has lacked a prescription drug benefit. The lack of this benefit has been the gaping hole in the Medicare safety net. Prescription drugs are the largest out-of-pocket health care cost for seniors. Many who cannot afford drug coverage often break the drugs in half, skip doses, or do not fill their prescriptions.The legislation the Senate passed last night will finally establish a benefit. I supported this bill because it is an important step forward in meeting the prescription drug needs of seniors. However, I am particularly concerned that the bill provides insufficient prescription drug coverage for seniors and depends excessively on private plans.Medicare beneficiaries will experience a gap in their prescription drug coverage after their drug expenditures reach $4,500. They will not receive any benefits until their total drug expenditures reach at least $5,813 unless they qualify for the additional low-income support. This gap in coverage will occur while they are still paying premiums. It is unfortunate that amendments designed to fill in the gap were defeated. This issue must be revisited in the future. Also, the eligibility requirements for the additional low-income support are too restrictive and will deny many seniors in need the extra help that they need.The dependence on private insurers to administer this benefit presents additional challenges to providing seniors with access to prescription drugs. Prescription drug-only insurance policies are currently not offered and they will need to be developed. The utilization of private plans creates a system in which insurers have incentives to limit access to needed drugs. In addition, the premiums that seniors pay for coverage are likely to vary depending on what region people live in. It is not equitable for a Federal benefit to have different prices across the country. Seniors should have the option of choosing a Medicare-administered plan instead of one that is run by a private insurer.It is unfortunate that amendments to strengthen the prescription drug coverage and to provide seniors with an option to enroll in a Medicare administered plan were defeated. I look forward to continue working with my colleagues to address these important issues to improve the Medicare prescription drug benefit.Again, I supported this bill because it is an important step towards providing much needed prescription drug coverage for seniors. Also, I am pleased that my amendment to restore a Medicaid disproportionate share hospital, DSH, allotment for Hawaii was adopted. This amendment is vital to Hawaii's hospitals which are struggling to meet the elevated demands placed upon them by the increasing number of uninsured patients. DSH payments will help Hawaii hospitals meet the rising health care needs of our communities. I hope that this provision is retained in conference.",

    "title": "SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise to submit a sense of the Senate resolution that the Senate supports improving American defenses against the spread of infectious diseases from abroad. The United States and other nations have a serious global problem in confronting the natural outbreak or deliberate spread of infectious diseases. The Central Intelligence Agency's January 2000 National Intelligence Estimate, NIE, The Global Infectious Disease Threat and Its Implications for the United States found that infectious diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide and that ``New and reemerging infectious diseases will pose a rising global health threat and will complicate U.S. and global security over the next 20 years.''I have been concerned about the bioterrorist threat to this country for some time. In 2001, as chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services, I chaired hearings that addressed the Nation's preparedness to respond to a bioterrorist attack. Sadly, the SARS outbreak demonstrated that naturally occurring diseases can be spread extraordinarily quickly through international air travel. This raises questions over our Nation's ability to counter a bioterrorist attack and protect our public health in general. Preparations that organize our health care network against a naturally occurring disease outbreak can also help guard Americans against a bioterrorist attack. Our first line of defense must be pushed beyond the borders of the United States to countries overseas. We should help stop the spread of a disease at its source before tens or hundreds of air-travelers inadvertently spread it around the globe.The World Health Organization, WHO, World Health Report 2002 estimates that infectious diseases accounted for more than 11 million deaths in 2001. Most of these infectious disease deaths occurred in the developing world, where they imposed a terrible burden on societies whose public health systems were already stretched beyond their limits. Infectious diseases, however, pose a threat to people in all parts of the world. Diseases easily spread beyond national borders.The NIE noted that many infectious diseases come from outside U.S. borders and are introduced by international travelers, immigrants, returning U.S. military personnel, or imported animals or foodstuffs. The report states the increase in international air travel and trade will ``dramatically increase the prospects,'' that infectious diseases will ``spread quickly around the globe, often in less time than the incubation period of most diseases.''Diseases that originated overseas, such as HIV/AIDS, have had a serious impact on the health and welfare of U.S. population. For example, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, there have been almost 450,000 deaths. There are an estimated 800,000 to 900,000 people currently living with human immunodeficiency virus in the United States with approximately 40,000 new human immunodeficiency virus infections occurring in the U.S. every year. SARS and the West Nile virus have also had an impact in the United States.The danger of an outbreak of a deadly disease overseas affecting the United States is increasing. The NIE found that war, natural disasters, economic collapse, and human complacency around the world are causing a breakdown in health care delivery and helping the emergence or reemergence of infectious diseases.To be forewarned is to be forearmed. The early warning of a disease outbreak is key to its identification; the quick application of countermeasures; and the development of cures. The General Accounting Office, GAO, noted in its August 2001 report, Global Health: Challenges in Improving Infectious Disease Surveillance Systems, that ``disease surveillance provides national and international public health authorities with information they need to plan and manage to control these diseases.''The next disease to strike the United States, like SARS, may be an unrecognized pathogen. As of July 2003, the SARS virus has sickened more than 8,000 people, including over 35 in the United States. The disease has killed more than 800 since the outbreak began in southern China, and has had severe economic repercussions in the countries beset by the outbreak. Although the disease appears to be under control for the moment, many fear there will be resurgence of SARS in the fall when the general flu and cold season begins. We have to do a better job next time, and by helping others we will help ourselves to do so. We need to strengthen our ability to detect foreign diseases before they cross our borders. The CDC has played a significant role in foreign disease surveillance for many years. Its Field Epidemiology Training Programs is an important program that strengthens global disease surveillance by training foreign specialists in modern epidemiology. FETPs have existed for almost 20 years and involve working with ministries of health around the world and the World Health Organization. Currently FETPs are in 30 countries throughout the world, supporting disease detection efforts and providing an essential link in global surveillance. The work of the FETPs is critical to establishing a first line of defense overseas to protect the health of local populations and of American citizens from the spread of deadly infectious diseases. This work is more timely and necessary than ever. As Dr. James Hughes, Director of the National Center for Infectious Diseases at the CDC told the Governmental Affairs Committee's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on July 30th, the lessons learned from the SARS outbreak show, ``The SARS experience reinforces the importance of global surveillance,'' as well as having prompt reporting and a strong laboratory capability.We need to ensure that the CDC work in this area, which is at times heroic, is given the funding it requires. We also need to keep this question prominently on our national agenda. We need attention focused on infectious diseases on an annual basis. We need to understand better the political and economic implications of the spread of infectious diseases for foreign countries and the United States, and we need to know what are likely future trends depending on the level of intervention to address this problem. I suggest that a NIE on infectious diseases should be produced each year so that we have a comprehensive analysis of worldwide infectious disease and health developments.The G-8 group of leading industrialized nations is playing a role on global health issues. At the 2003 Evian summit, the G-8 made a commitment to fight against the so-called big three diseases of AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. But the G-8 recognized the spread of SARS demonstrated ``the importance of global collaboration, including global disease surveillance.'' These words need to be backed by vigorous, coordinated actions. I urge the President to work with the G-8 to create regional FETP programs so that every part of the world can be covered by a strong public health disease surveillance system.Moreover, we should support the World Health Organization, whose work provides a critical underpinning to the efforts of the global public health community. The World Health Organization's regular budget has been more or less flat since the mid-1990s in nominal terms, around $420 million a year. In real terms, some estimate this means it has been reduced by 25 percent or more. WHO receives additional extra budgetary funding of several hundred million dollars a year. But most of this is project specific and does not directly support the basic public health activities of WHO and is not a substitute for funding core WHO activities. WHO global surveillance activities have been built with very modest extra budgetary contributions on top of a modest amount of core resources. But WHO's global disease surveillance work is underfunded and is being conducted in an overall context of declining real WHO core funding.",

    "title": "COMPACT OF FREE ASSOCIATION WITH THE FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA AND THE REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today to speak about S.J. Res. 16, the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003, which was introduced by myself, Senators Bingaman, Domenici, and Craig on July 14, 2003. S.J. Res. 16 is the Bush administration's legislative proposal codifying 3 years of negotiations on title II of the Compact of Free Association between the United States and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and the Federated States of Micronesia, FSM. I have been monitoring this process very closely since negotiations began in 1999.When the Senate returns after Labor Day, we have a very short window to enact this legislation, which is critical to the success of the U.S. political relationship with these two Pacific Island nations. I want to take some time to share with my colleagues the amendments that I intend to offer to ensure that the negotiated provisions remain consistent with the intent of the Compact of Free Association since its enactment in 1986 and address specific issues as they relate to the costs borne by the State of Hawaii over the past 17 years.My interest in these islands first began when I was stationed there in World War II, as a soldier in the United States Army. The first island that I landed on was Enewetak, an atoll in what is now the RMI. I ended up on Saipan and Tinian where I watched the Enola Gay take off for Hiroshima. I then returned to the islands that are now the FSM and RMI as a first mate on a missionary ship and spent six months in the islands. After being elected to Congress, I continued to closely follow events in the Pacific islands and continued my relationships with many of the families in the RMI and FSM.As a member of the Senate, I have been privileged to serve on the Senate Energy Committee which has jurisdiction over insular areas. I have returned to the islands on trips, often with my friend and former colleague, the former Chairman of the Energy Committee, Governor Frank Murkowski, and I have continued to meet with Pacific island government leaders.I have been very interested in the negotiations which have been ongoing since 1999, not only because of the impact of the Compact of Free Association on the State of Hawaii, but because of my interest in ensuring that the United States preserves its commitment first under the U.N. Trusteeship agreement and then under the Compact to establish sovereign governments and to promote economic development and self-sufficiency.I commend the chairman and ranking member of the Energy Committee, Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman, for their efforts to expedite consideration of this legislation in the Senate, and their appreciation of what needs to be done to fulfill our responsibilities to our allies in the Freely Associated States, or FAS.The Federated States of Micronesia is a group of 607 small islands in the Western Pacific about 2,500 miles southwest of Hawaii. While it has a total land area of about 270.8 square miles, the FSM occupies more than one million square miles of the Pacific Ocean. It is composed of four island states, formerly known as the Caroline Islands--Kosrae, Pohnpei, Chuuk, and Yap. Today, the FSM Constitution provides for three branches of government--the executive, judicial and legislative branches. The President is the head of state of the national government and there are elected Governors for each of the four states. The estimated population of the FSM is 105,500.The Republic of the Marshall Islands is located about 2,136 miles southwest of Hawaii and is made up of five islands and 29 atolls. While the RMI's total land area is only about 70 square miles, the RMI covers about 750,000 square miles of sea area. There are three branches of government in the RMI--the legislative, executive and judicial branches. The head of state is the President, who is elected by the legislature from its membership. The population of the RMI is approximately 56,000.The Compact of Free Association may be new to some of my colleagues, particularly those who were not in Congress in 1986. The United States has a very unique relationship with the FSM, RMI, and Palau, whose Compact is not being considered for negotiation. It is unfortunate that there is some misunderstanding about the purpose and intent of the Compact of Free Association. The compact established the RMI and FSM as sovereign states that conduct their own foreign policies. Both countries were admitted to the United Nations in 1991. However, the Freely Associated States remain dependent upon the United States for military protection and economic assistance. The compact provides that the United States has the prerogative to reject the strategic use of, or military access to, the FAS by other countries, which is often referred to as the ``right of strategic denial.'' The compact also provides that the U.S. may block FAS government policies that it deems inconsistent with its duty to defend the FAS, which is referred to as the ``defense veto.'' Under the compact, the United States also has the exclusive military base rights in the FAS. In exchange, the U.S. is required to support the FAS economically, with the goal of producing self-sufficiency and FAS citizens are allowed entry into the United States as nonimmigrants for the purposes of education, medical treatment and employment.As we consider S.J. Res. 16, I will be offering a number of amendments to address the sufficiency of the negotiated provisions to fulfill the U.S. commitment to assist the FSM and RMI with economic development opportunities, with the goal of self-sufficiency in 20 years. I am also working on amendments to address issues specific to the costs incurred by Hawaii during the first 17 years of the Compact of Free Association.I have a tiered approach to meet these objectives. My long-term intent is to improve the education and medical infrastructure in the RMI and FSM. Economic development and self- sufficiency cannot occur without the proper tools of education and health care. These improvements will take substantial investment over time. My short-term goal is to reimburse the State of Hawaii for the costs incurred by the compact. I will discuss those amendments in a few minutes.Title II of the compact, Economic Relations, expired on September 30, 2001. The compact provided, however, a two-year extension if negotiations were underway. Title II expires on September 30, 2003. Title II is critical to the success of the compact as it includes all of the Federal funding for the RMI and FSM. It is my understanding that the legislative proposal contains some unilateral changes that were made to the compact without the consent of the RMI and FSM governments--we will need to examine those provisions closely. In addition, I believe we need to examine some of the immigration provisions which are included in S.J. Res. 16 to ensure that they do not circumvent the purpose of the Compact of Free Association.I would now like to turn to the issue of disaster assistance. Under the current compact, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, provided disaster relief to the communities in the FSM and RMI. In addition, FEMA provides essential services after natural disasters such as typhoons or tsunamis. Disaster assistance includes both individual grants and low-interest loans. Most, but not all, Federal assistance is in the form of low-interest loans to cover expenses not covered by State or local programs, or private insurance. Individuals who do not qualify for loans may be able to apply for a cash grant. Cash grants are also available for home repair, rental, and funeral services.The public assistance grants for community infrastructure allow territorial, local, or even village-level organizations to respond to disasters, to recover from their impact, and to mitigate impact from future disasters. While these grants are aimed at governments and organizations, their final goal is to help a community and all its citizens recover from devastating natural disasters. The grant assistance, provided on a matching basis, helps toward the repair, replacement, or restoration of disaster-damaged, publicly-owned facilities. FEMA assistance is critical. In 2002, Typhoon Cha'atan hit the FSM and caused 50 deaths, injured hundreds of people, and resulted in $6 million in property damage.S.J. Res. 16 removes FEMA's role in providing disaster relief, and replaces it with the U.S. Agency for International Development, Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, OFDA. This doesn't make sense. OFDA assistance is for humanitarian relief of disasters in foreign nations, with direct provision of food and shelter, and assistance in protecting health and rebuilding water supplies. FEMA's disaster assistance, through its individual and public assistance grants, provides U.S. communities with the ability to rebuild and reinvest in their infrastructure. We have invested millions in FSM and RMI to build and protect infrastructure. These investments need to be protected to ensure that these Pacific island communities will be able to recover from natural disasters.We cannot terminate FEMA's disaster assistance. We must replace USAID's OFDA with FEMA's disaster assistance programs for the amended compact, maintaining the strong and reliable service that the islands need when peoples' lives are destroyed by natural disasters. I look forward to working with my colleagues to rectify this situation.As we continue assisting the FAS in building up physical infrastructure and achieving long-term self-sufficiency under a new funding mechanism, I cannot emphasize enough the urgent need to continue FAS eligibility for federal programs. It is important for us to maintain the view that such programs are complementary to the economic assistance under the compact and must continue to be open to FAS citizens if we are to succeed in allowing the FSM and RMI to fully develop.Federal programs in education have been a cornerstone for FAS communities, particularly in the later years of the original compact. This was when schooling evolved away from--as noted in 1994 by an Asian Development Bank study--its use as a tool to advance the interests and objectives of colonial powers. Rather, educational content has become more appropriate to traditional education and changed the lives of many FAS citizens for the better, strongly encouraging them to actually enroll in school.It is remarkable, for example, that the proportion of those who completed secondary education in the FSM almost doubled from 25 to 47 percent between 1980 and 1994. Today, the FSM Government reports that the literacy rate is quite high and all children are required to attend school at least through the eighth grade. In the RMI, elementary school enrollment increased from almost 7,400 in the late, seventies to more than 11,700 in 2000, while secondary school enrollment went from 1,430 to 2,586 in the same period.It is imperative that we help to educate young generations in the FAS because those ages 15 years or younger make up nearly half of the FSM and RIM populations and will eventually become parents, workers, and government, business, and community leaders. Education is the key to a strong future for these island communities and will ensure that the U.S. investments in these populations will reap positive returns.However, despite the great progress that has been made, the FAS clearly have a long way to go in improving their educational systems. This is evidenced by FAS citizens' continued migration to Hawaii and other parts of the U.S. for educational opportunity. Even so, the Micronesians and Marshallese have taken education into their own hands and are striving mightily to attune it to the needs of their people. In this vein, Federal programs such as Head Start, title I for disadvantaged populations, the Individuals with Disabilites Education Act, IDEA, and Pell Grants have tremendously helped by empowering the FAS and providing vital resources to help them create sound education systems that serve the needs of their people. Indeed, I have been assured that without Pell Grant assistance, higher education institutions such as the College of Micronesia would be unable to continue operating.Given the importance of such programs to the FAS, I am concerned about recent and ongoing efforts in the other body to limit or eliminate FAS eligibility for various education and other domestic Federal programs. I am not alone in this concern. I was pleased to join Senators Domenici, Bingaman, and Craig in writing on May 20 to the leaders on the HELP Committee, asking that they maintain support for the FAS through eligibility for various education programs. As we state in the letter, ``the loss of such funding could very well mean the end of education services at all age levels in the FAS.'' When we return in September, I intend to pursue this matter with my colleagues.I would now like to address some compact issues specific to the State of Hawaii. Section 104(e)(1) of the Compact (Public Law 99-239) states, ``it is not the intent of the Congress to cause any adverse consequences for the United States territories and commonwealths or the State of Hawaii.'' The compact further authorizes appropriations for such sums as may be necessary to cover the costs, if any, incurred by the State of Hawaii, the territories of Guam and American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, CNMI.As FAS citizens are allowed free entry into the United States as part of the compact, many FAS citizens reside in the State of Hawaii. Since 1997, when Hawaii began reporting its impact costs, the State has identified over $140 million in costs associated with FAS citizens. In 2002, the State of Hawaii expended over $32 million in assistance to FAS citizens, with the highest costs reported in education. The State of Hawaii has received a total of $6 million in compact impact aid, largely due to our efforts in the Senate and the leadership of the senior Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Dan Inouye. This modest amount of funding, however, does not adequately reimburse the State of Hawaii for its costs over the past 17 years.S.J. Res. 16 includes $15 million in mandatory funds to be distributed annually between the State of Hawaii, Guam and the CNMI for compact impact aid. While it is an improvement to have mandatory funding earmarked for compact impact aid, the amount is not based on the actual costs to the affected areas over the past 17 years. As I have just said, for 2002 alone, the State of Hawaii spent over $32 million on services for FAS citizens. I plan on offering an amendment to increase the amount of annual compact impact aid to the State of Hawaii and other affected areas. I am also drafting an amendment which would authorize reimbursement for the funds expended by the governments of the affected areas between 1986 and 2003.Hawaii's medical providers have also suffered because they are owed thousands of dollars in unpaid medical bills. Some of the debt has been incurred by individuals, FAS citizens lacking financial resources--who present themselves to medical providers for treatment. Other debt, however, is a result of the medical referral program, and is to be paid by the FSM and RMI governments. The medical referral program allows FAS citizens to travel to Hawaii for medical treatment to be paid by the FSM or RMI because such treatment is not available in their country.During its consideration of the original compact, Congress recognized this problem and authorized funding for unpaid debts related to the medical referral program which were incurred prior to 1985. Unfortunately, the problem has continued. Hawaii's medical providers, who are already having difficulties meeting the health care needs of their communities, are unfairly penalized because of the inability of the island governments to pay the medical bills associated with the medical referral program. I will introduce an amendment that would extend the authorization for funding for the medical referral program debts to 2003.I also plan to offer amendments which would alleviate the compact's cost to the State of Hawaii by restoring and establishing the eligibility of FAS citizens for programs such as Medicaid, Food Stamps, and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, TANF.It is imperative that we restore eligibility of FAS citizens for non-emergency Medicaid. FAS citizens lost many of their public benefits as a result of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity, PRWORA, Act of 1996, including Medicaid coverage. FAS citizens were previously eligible for Medicaid as aliens permanently residing under color of law in the United States.After the enactment of welfare reform, the State of Hawaii could no longer claim Federal matching funds for services rendered to FAS citizens. Since then, the State of Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands have continued to meet the health care needs of FAS citizens. The State of Hawaii has used state resources to provide Medicaid services to FAS citizens. In 2002 alone, the State spent approximately $6.75 million to provide Medicaid services without receiving any federal matching funds.There has been an increasing trend in the need for health care services among FAS citizens. During the current fiscal year, the number of individuals served in the State of Hawaii's Medicaid program has grown from 3,291 to 4,818 people based on the average monthly enrollment. This is an increase of 46 percent. For only the first half of the fiscal year, the State of Hawaii has spent $4.66 million for the Medicaid costs incurred for FAS citizens. These Medicaid costs do not reflect additional State expenditures on medical care contracts to care for the uninsured, community health care services, and for the activities of the Department of Health's Communicable Disease Branch.The Federal Government must provide appropriate resources to help states meet the healthcare needs of the FAS citizens--an obligation based on a federal commitment. It is unconscionable for a state or territory to shoulder the entire financial burden of providing necessary education, medical, and social services to individuals who are residing in that state or territory when the obligation is that of the Federal Government. For that reason, I am seeking to provide reimbursement of these costs. It is time for the Federal Government to take up some of the financial responsibility that until now has been carried by the State of Hawaii, CNMI, and Guam, by restoring public benefits to FAS citizens.Eligibility of FAS citizens for nonemergency Medicaid must be restored. In addition, the State of Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and the CNMI should be reimbursed for the Medicaid expenses of FAS citizens incurred since 1996. It is the right thing to do.Continuing along the lines of assisting FAS citizens towards long-term self-sufficiency, I would now like to turn to the issue of social services. The need for support provided by a safety net of social services becomes apparent when we take a look at the economic conditions FAS citizens face at home. In 2001, per capita income, as measured by purchasing power parity, was $1,600 in the RMI and $2,000 in the FSM. This amounts to almost $8,000 below the poverty threshold per capita in the U.S. for that same year. Furthermore, many FAS families are single-parent households and face many barriers to employment, including low or no-job skills, low levels of education, and disabilities.This is why it is important to provide Federal support through social service programs while continuing to develop new economic opportunities for FAS citizens. Otherwise, the impact of serving FAS citizens will continue to be felt outside of the FAS. For instance, in Hawaii, according to the state's Attorney General, financial assistance in the form of the Temporary Assistance to Other Needy Families, TAONF, program, a State program, provided $4.5 million to FAS citizens in State Fiscal year 2002. This amount is secondary only to the amount spent to provide educational services to the FAS. Of this total, $390,000 went to the General Assistance program, which supports individuals and couples with little or no income and who have a temporary, incapacitating medical condition; $532,000 supported aged, blind, and disabled FAS citizens with little or no income who are not eligible for federally-funded Supplemental Security Income SSI; and $3.6 million went to the State's TAONF program that assists other needy families who are not eligible for federal-funding under the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, TANF, program.The number of FAS citizens served by the Hawaii Department of Human Services has increased by almost 20 percent in the span of one year alone. The financial assistance that the State of Hawaii provides to FAS citizens in the form of TAONF is a great support to those families attempting to achieve economic stability.I am also planning on offering an amendment to make FAS citizens eligible for the Food Stamp Program. The Food Stamp Program serves as the first line of defense against hunger. It is the cornerstone of the federal food assistance program and provides crucial support to needy households and those making the transition from welfare to work. We have partially addressed the complicated issue of alien eligibility for public benefits such as Food Stamps, but again, I must say it is just partial. Not only should all legal immigrants receive these benefits, but so too citizens of the FAS. Exclusion of FAS citizens from federal, state, or local public benefits or programs is an unintended and misguided consequence of the welfare reform law.We allow certain legal immigrants eligibility in the program. Yet FAS citizens, who are not considered immigrants, but who are required to sign up for the Selective Service if they are residing in the United States, are ineligible to receive food stamps. We must correct this inequity. I will work on clarifying current law regarding FAS citizens' eligibility for various federal assistance programs, including TANF and Food Stamps.In addition, I ask my colleagues to support efforts to extend current TANF state waivers and reinstate recently expired state waivers. Hawaii has been operating under a waiver approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services since 1996. To date, Hawaii has met all of its employment goals, despite experiencing difficult economic times in the 90s and into the current decade. This waiver maintains protections for disabled individuals, including FAS citizens, which were reported in the State Fiscal Year 2002 as numbering over 200. I am concerned that proposals that would limit various support services to this disabled population to three months would guarantee failure for many Hawaii families, including FAS citizens, should Hawaii's waiver be allowed to expire. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Finance Committee on this separate TANF reauthorization issue.I cannot stress the importance of the Compact of Free Association to the Pacific islands, the State of Hawaii, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. The United States made a commitment to help these countries attain self-sufficiency through economic development and Federal programs based on a political relationship unique to this situation. We must honor this commitment by ensuring adequate resources to meet our obligations. We cannot treat the FSM and RMI as mere allies and foreign nations--the political relationship of free association calls for more than that. We must provide Federal benefits such as Food Stamps, TANF, and Medicaid to FAS citizens residing in the U.S. We must ensure that the trust funds for each country have sufficient funding to ensure that in 20 years, the RMI and FSM will be able to function as economically independent nations. We must improve the infrastructure of the education and medical systems in the RMI and FSM to alleviate the long-term impact of the Compact on the State of Hawaii and Pacific territories. We must continue eligibility in federal education programs such as Head Start, the Individuals with Disabilities Act, Pell Grants, title I, and the No Child Left Behind Act to ensure that we equip future generations of Micronesians and Marshallese with the educational tools necessary to succeed in the 21st century. We must do all of this in a culturally sensitive manner.We have a big challenge ahead of us, to keep the commitment we made in 1986. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues on this important endeavor.",

    "title": "DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004",
    "text": "Mr. President, I yield myself 30 minutes to offer an amendment to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill to add $5 million in funding to the bill before the Senate for the Excellence in Economic Education Act.I thank amendment cosponsors Senators Allen, Sarbanes, Corzine, Kennedy, Stabenow, and Dodd for their support. Our leaders on the Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, Senators Specter and Harkin, have been helpful in working with me on this effort. I appreciate the difficult job they have before them to remain within tight budget constraints imposed on us by necessary increases for military operations in Iraq and the newest round of tax cuts. I opposed the budget resolution and the tax bill because I knew that it could lead to this appropriations fight, spurred by unrealistic caps on important education, social welfare, and other domestic programs, pitting important priorities against each other. Despite these challenges facing the bill before us, I hope that we can work something out to have the Excellence in Economic Education Act, or Triple-E, funded.The Triple-E provides significant resources for economics and personal finance education, which are not receiving due attention by Congress. Although the Triple-E was included in the No Child Left Behind Act, the only comprehensive economic education program being funded by this bill is one to assist the teaching of economics outside of this country. I fully support grants to improve the quality of civic and economic education through exchange programs with emerging democracies, which represent important efforts to foster democracy in former Soviet states and other areas of the world. However, the lack of support for a corresponding authorized domestic program is unconscionable. This is particularly disturbing as schools must prepare for the first National Assessment of Educational Progress, NAEP, in Economics, which according to the National Assessment Governing Board, is on track for 2006. The Triple-E can fill this gap in domestic support for economic and financial literacy, but the program must be funded.Let me tell you what I am referring to when I mention economics and personal finance education. These are very practical subjects that everyone should know--as basic in many cases as are reading, writing, and arithmetic. Again, referring to the 2006 NAEP in Economics, the framework for the assessment states that economic literacy includes an understanding of ``the fundamental constraints imposed by limited resources, the resulting choices people have to make, and the trade-offs they face; how economies and markets work and how people function within them; and the benefits and costs of economic interaction and interdependence among people and nations.''The framework continues to note that literacy in this area ``also includes having the skills that allow people to function effectively in their roles as consumers, producers, savers, investors, and responsible citizens. These skills include economic reasoning, problem solving, decision making, and the ability to analyze real-life situations.''Personal finance, which is an important component of economics, speaks cogently to situations that Americans face every day. How are we making decisions when we pull out our wallets at the grocery store or in the lunch line? Are we each checking our credit reports regularly and understanding how they contribute to a bank's or credit union's decision about whether our loan applications will be approved? How are families making budgeting choices every week, and are they sticking to those choices? This is difficult to say, given that personal bankruptcy filings continue to set record levels. For the first quarter of 2003, household debt service payments were almost 14 percent of disposable personal income. During the first 3 months of 2003, the percentage of mortgages in the foreclosure process climbed to another record high. We may attribute much of this to current economic conditions. However, I daresay that some of the financial troubles faced by Americans today could have been mitigated if they received pragmatic, standards-based education from a young age, when individuals are forming the habits that they may take with them throughout their lives.Indeed, our children are not being fully prepared by our schools to face the realities of life because they are proving to be illiterate in economics and personal finance. According to the 2002 National Jump$tart Survey, economic and financial literacy scores have declined since the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy conducted its first survey of high school seniors in 1997. The significance of surveying high school students is that high school is the last formal opportunity many individuals will have to acquire a comprehensive understanding of economic and personal finance. Therefore, the results from the 2002 survey indicating failing scores from more than 68 percent of high school seniors taking the survey are troubling. They failed to demonstrate an understanding of the basic fundamentals of economics and personal financial management. For instance, the survey found that the majority of students believed that interest from a savings account may not be taxed. They also thought that an elderly retired man and his wife, who is also retired, should have the highest amount of life insurance, as opposed to a young single mother with children. While some may not think that this is important, young adults entering the workforce should understand that interest from investments, including savings accounts, is a form of income that is taxable just like one's salary. In addition, life insurance is meant to provide income for those who are significantly dependent upon the primary income earner in the family. The survey also found the greatest declines in scores on questions relating to money management and savings.The need to provide funding for the Triple-E Act is now. We need to send a message to our schools that we will support economic and personal finance studies. While results from the Jump$tart survey are illuminating, many public high schools did not participate out of concern that poor scores would require them to focus valuable and limited resources on courses other than those such as math, English, and science. As schools hesitate to understand the real-world implications of this attitude toward personal finance and economic education, it is the students who are the real losers.My attention was drawn to the need in this area faced by the State I represent. Over the August recess, I cosponsored with the Hawaii Council on Economic Education Hawaii's first ever Economic and Financial Literacy Conference, which drew tremendous support from many different levels and sectors of the community. I was pleased to have representatives from the Departments of Education and the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, Jump$tart and the National Council on Economic Education--NCEE, as well as a broad array of representatives from Hawaii's business and education sectors, State Legislature, and Governor's office. The more than 200 people at the conference heard the results of a survey of adults in Hawaii's workforce-- beneficiaries of Hawaii's education system. Although those taking the survey correctly answered an average of 13 in 20 questions, many did not have a clear understanding of basic concepts such as what constitutes a budget deficit and what is the significance of the stock market. Furthermore, the University of Hawaii department of economics unveiled a paper showing a steady increase then sharp decline in economic education in Hawaii in 1999. Thus, in the State I know best, despite a clear community interest in economic and personal finance education, we have a long way to go toward serving our children in these important subjects.Furthermore, students are not receiving this education at home, with only about 1 in 4, or 26 percent, of 13- to 21-year-olds reporting that their parents actively taught them to manage money. I am not advocating for government to be assuming this role in lieu of parents doing so. However, many Americans begin their roles as parents without having received adequate economics and personal finance education themselves, and thus lack the tools to provide their children with sound advice or the ability to steer them to useful resources.With this point made, let us turn the spotlight on state education systems. How are they doing in this area? I am sad to say not as well as they could be doing. According to the third biennial survey of States by the NCEE, the number of States having economic standards grew dramatically. In 1998, 38 States included economics in their standards. In 2000 and 2002, ten more States adopted economic standards. However, the percentage of States with standards who required them to be implemented dropped from 75 to 71 percent from 2000 to 2002. Furthermore, only one in four States tested students' economics knowledge in 1998. The current economics testing picture is in the chart behind me, where you can see only a marginal improvement to 27 States testing students, with four others--Indiana, Nebraska, Oregon, and Utah--in development. Hawaii is included in those States not testing students. Again, with the upcoming 2006 NAEP, although we are presently unsure which students will be tested, it would behoove States to begin assessing where their students are in terms of understanding economics.Measuring the presence of personal finance in State standards produces a picture even more bleak, with ground lost in key measures. According to NCEE, the number of States including personal finance in education standards grew from 21 to 40 from 1998 to 2000, but then fell dramatically to 31 States in 2002. The status of standards implementation is even worse, but slowly improving, from 14 States in 1998 to 17 in 2002. Regarding testing, although personal finance is often part of another subject test such as economics, only eight States conduct personal finance testing, with another two States with tests in development. As you can see in my next chart, testing is currently required in Alabama, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Rhode Island, with tests planned or in development in Oregon and Utah. The bright spot there is that this is a significant increase from 1998, when only one State tested student achievement in personal finance.In a related testing matter, Triple-E funding would be an important help at the State and local levels as school districts are facing the challenges of meeting Annual Yearly Progress requirements under the No Child Left Behind Act. We must provide States the opportunity to explore the possibility that math and reading scores could be increased, if economics and personal finance are integrated into these other basic subjects. We all know children who may not easily be able to add apples and oranges but can instantly arrive at an answer to a calculation involving dollars and cents.In fact, this type of integration in teaching economics and personal finance was discussed at length at a roundtable sponsored on May 16, 2002, by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, involving the U.S. Department of Education, education groups such as the Council of Chief State School Officers and National Association of Elementary School Principals, and economic and financial literacy organizations such as the National Council on Economic Education, Junior Achievement, and the Jump$tart Coalition. The roundtable resulted in a white paper which says that if we dedicate ourselves to integrating financial concepts into reading and mathematics curricula, we can teach children the basics of financial education via several access points. Modes of entry include developing standards of financial education, creating tests that correspond to the curricula taught in classrooms, cooperating with publishers of textbooks and other instructional materials to stress the incorporation of financial concepts into their products, promoting the use of ``off-the-shelf financial education curricula'' distributed by community groups dedicated to financial education, and training those most responsible for conveying these valuable lessons to students--our educators.It is also noted in the white paper that States requiring students to complete financial education courses produce graduates who have higher savings rates and net worth, as a percentage of earnings, compared with those who graduate from schools in States with no such requirement. Society as a whole benefits from higher levels of savings and investment, which drive economic activity.All of this provides the broad context of why I am offering my amendment today. The Triple-E will ensure that vital resources will go to the national, State, and local levels to provide a needed boost to economic and financial literacy. The Triple-E Act would work to do this by awarding a competitive grant to a national nonprofit educational organization that exists primarily to improve student understanding about economic and financial literacy through the classroom. The organization would distribute 75 percent of funds to State and local partnerships for teacher training, assistance to school districts desiring to incorporate economics and personal finance into curricula, evaluations of the impact of economic and financial literacy education on students, related research, and school-based student activities. The national organization would use the rest of the grant for the strengthening of relationships with State and local entities, teacher training, research on effective teaching practices, assessment development, and material development and dissemination.Furthermore, the intent of the approach in the Triple-E, due to a federal match requirement, is to help existing and new programs to be self-supporting and involve the entities that should be on the front lines advocating financial and economic literacy; that is, banks, credit unions, businesses, and private industry. They are the very entities that benefit from a well-educated citizenry that knows how to take advantage of opportunities for savings, borrowing, and investing, and avoiding financial mistakes such as misusing credit or having to file for bankruptcy. In general, these entities want the very best education for the next generation of managers, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and consumers so that sound financial decisions can be made, economic growth can continue, and Americans can be good consumers who pay their bills on time and remain personally financially independent. As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan noted in a recent speech to the Jump$tart Coalition, ``Building bridges between community organizations, our educational institutions, and private businesses will be an essential aspect of our efforts to increase familiarity with new technological and financial tools that are fundamental to improving individual economic well-being. And the success of such efforts will bear significantly on how well prepared our society is to meet the challenges of an increasingly knowledge-based economy.'' A cooperative approach is necessary to help current efforts thrive, which is the type of effort supported by the Triple-E Act.I would like to note at this time that this body already expressed support for the type of education advocated by the Triple-E Act when it passed my resolution designating April 2003 as Financial Literacy for Youth Month. I am pleased that the other body followed suit by passing a similar version of my resolution, both of which contributed to the effort to raise awareness for financial literacy. This effort is also supported by various organizations, many associated with the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy. For example, America's Community Bankers stated, `` . . . we are strong supporters of financial literacy initiatives because ACB believes that informed consumers--including young consumers--are better able to make wise credit and other financial decisions.''Another letter from the North American Securities Administrators Association states:As a majority of Americans have become investors, there is an obligation to ensure individuals have a basic understanding of the principles of savings and investing, as well as preserving their accumulated wealth. Every day, it becomes more apparent that there is a population of investors who are ill equipped to make critical financial decisions for their lives.One could only read the names of entities and organizations that are a part of the Jump$tart Coalition to understand how broad the base of support is for financial and economic literacy.Many States are echoing these supportive statements, including my State of Hawaii. I was delighted that the Hawaii State Legislature approved a resolution similar to my Senate resolution and Governor Linda Lingle signed a proclamation for Financial Literacy for Youth Month. Furthermore, I have been working closely with the Hawaii Council on Economic Education, which supports funding for the Triple-E. I ask unanimous consent that a support letter from the Council be printed in the Record following my statement.",

    "title": "STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS--SEPTEMBER 17, 2003",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with my friend and colleague from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, to provide certain Federal public benefits for citizens of the Freely Associated States (FAS) who are residing in the United States. The bill would provide eligibility for non-emergency Medicaid, Food Stamps, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, and Supplemental Security Income to FAS citizens residing in the United States.Citizens from the FAS are citizens from the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), and Palau. The United States has a very unique relationship with the FSM, RMI, and Palau. The Compact of Free Association established these Nations as sovereign States responsible for their own foreign policies. However, the Freely Associated States remain dependent upon the United States for military protection and economic assistance.The Compact provides that the United States has the prerogative to reject the strategic use of, or military access to, the FAS by other countries, which is often referred to as the ``right of strategic denial.'' The Compact also provides that the United States may block FAS government policies that it deems inconsistent with its duty to defend the FAS, which is referred to as the ``defense veto.'' Under the Compact, the United States has exclusive military base rights in the FAS. In exchange, the United States is required to support the FAS economically, with the goal of producing self-sufficiency, and FAS citizens are allowed entry into the United States as non-immigrants for the purposes of education, medical treatment, and employment.The Senate is considering S.J. Res. 16, the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003, which was favorably reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources this morning. S.J. Res. 16 is the codification of title II of the Compact pertaining to economic relations.As FAS citizens are allowed free entry into the United States as part of the Compact, many FAS citizens reside in the State of Hawaii. Since 1997, when Hawaii began reporting its impact costs, the State has identified over $140 million in costs associated with FAS citizens. In 2002, the State of Hawaii expended over $32 million in assistance to FAS citizens. S.J. Res. 16 provides $30 million in annual funding for Compact impact assistance to be shared between the State of Hawaii, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. While this funding is a positive step forward, it does not begin to reimburse the affected jurisdictions for the costs associated with FAS citizens living in Hawaii.The legislation we are introducing today would provide assistance to States and territories who have continued to shoulder the majority of the costs associated with the Compact. The Federal Government must provide appropriate resources to help States meet the needs of the FAS citizens--an obligation based on a Federal commitment. It is unconscionable for a State or territory to shoulder the entire financial burden of providing necessary education, medical, and social services to individuals who are residing in that State or territory when the obligation is that of the Federal Government. For that reason, I am seeking to provide reimbursement of these costs. It is time for the Federal Government to take up some of the financial responsibility that until now has been carried by the State of Hawaii, CNMI, and Guam, by restoring public benefits to FAS citizens.This bill would restore eligibility of FAS citizens for non-emergency Medicaid. FAS citizens lost many of their public benefits as a result of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity (PRWORA) Act of 1996, including Medicaid coverage. FAS citizens were previously eligible for Medicaid as aliens permanently residing under color of law in the United States.After the enactment of welfare reform, the State of Hawaii could no longer claim Federal matching funds for services rendered to FAS citizens. Since then, the State of Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands have continued to meet the health care needs of FAS citizens. The State of Hawaii has used State resources to provide Medicaid services to FAS citizens. In 2002 alone, the State spent approximately $6.75 million to provide Medicaid services without receiving any Federal matching funds.There has been an increasing trend in the need for health care services among FAS citizens. During the current fiscal year, the number of individuals served in the State of Hawaii's Medicaid Program has grown from 3,291 to 4,818 people based on the average monthly enrollment. This is an increase of 46 percent. For only the first half of the fiscal year, the State of Hawaii has spent $4.66 million for the Medicaid costs incurred for FAS citizens. These Medicaid costs do not reflect additional State expenditures on medical care contracts to care for the uninsured, for community health care services, and for the activities of the Department of Health's Communicable Disease Branch.This bill would also provide eligibility for FAS citizens residing in the United States to participate in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Supplemental Security Income programs. According to Hawaii's Attorney General, financial assistance in the form of the Temporary Assistance to Other Needy Families (TAONF) program, a State program, provided $4.5 million to FAS citizens in State Fiscal Year 2002. Of this total, $390,000 was provided through the General Assistance program, which supports individuals and couples with little or no income and who have a temporary, incapacitating medical condition; $532,000 supported aged, blind, and disabled FAS citizens with little or no income who are not eligible for Federally funded Supplemental Security Income; and $3.6 million was spent on the State's TAONF program that assists other needy families who are not eligible for Federal funding under the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program. The number of FAS citizens served by the Hawaii Department of Human Services has increased by almost 20 percent in the span of one year alone. The financial assistance that the State of Hawaii provides to FAS citizens in the form of TAONF is a great support to those families attempting to achieve economic stability, but it has a significant financial impact on the State's budget.The bill would also provide eligibility for the Food Stamp Program. The Food Stamp Program serves as the first line of defense against hunger. It is the cornerstone of the Federal food assistance program and provides crucial support to needy households and those making the transition for welfare to work. We have partially addressed the complicated issue of alien eligibility for public benefits such as food stamps, but again, I must say it is just partial. Not only should all legal immigrants receive these benefits, but so too citizens of the FAS. Exclusion of FAS citizens from Federal, State, or local public benefits or programs is an unintended and misguided consequence of the welfare reform law.We allow certain legal immigrants eligibility in the program. Yet FAS citizens, who are not considered immigrants, but who are required to sign up for the Selective Service if they are residing in the United States, are ineligible to receive food stamps. This bill corrects this inequity.I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this measure which is of critical importance to my State of Hawaii, which has borne the costs of these benefits for FAS citizens living in Hawaii for the past 17 years.I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.",

    "title": "MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT, AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003--CONFERENCE REPORT",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the conference report for H.R. 1, the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003.For far too long Medicare has lacked a prescription drug benefit. The lack of this benefit has been the gaping hole in the Medicare safety net. I have consistently supported efforts to establish a meaningful Medicare prescription drug benefit. I supported S. 1, the Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003, because it would have been an important step forward in meeting the prescription drug needs of seniors. I am extremely disappointed that instead of making improvements in the Senate-passed bill, the conference report is now a false promise to our seniors. Mr. President, the conference report contains too many flaws to warrant passage. The conference report lacks appropriate prescription drug coverage for seniors. Indeed, many seniors will be worse off under this proposal. The conference report also weakens the existing Medicare entitlement program.The prescription drug coverage in this legislation is simply not comprehensive enough. Too small an allowance is provided within the legislation to establish a meaningful prescription drug benefit for seniors. Instead of reducing the size of the coverage gap, the conference report would require that seniors pay for all of their drug costs after their total drug spending reaches $2,250. Despite continuing to pay their premiums, they will not receive any additional support until they spend about $5,000. This gap is about twice as large as the gap that was contained in the Senate-passed bill. Why should seniors have to continue to pay premiums when they do not receive any benefits if they are in the gap? This coverage gap must be filled.Mr. President, for too many seniors in Hawaii and across the nation, prescription drug coverage will be worse under the provisions in the conference report. Seniors who are currently provided prescription drugs through their state's Medicaid programs will have federally mandated copayments imposed on them. For example, Hawaii's seniors who have incomes of less than 100 percent of the poverty level and obtain their medications through Hawaii's Medicaid program will be worse off under this plan. They will now have to pay copayments to get their prescription medication. Hawaii's seniors are not alone. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities believes that most of the 6.4 million individuals that have dual eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid will be charged more under the conference agreement for medication than under existing law.I am afraid that too many low-income seniors will not be able to afford even these meager copayments. Those who cannot meet these copayments will be denied access to the medications they are currently being provided. Again, they will go without the treatment they need. In addition, the financial burden that the conference report places on states may lead to a reduction in other Medicaid services that states will no longer be able to afford, because of the substantial share of prescription drug costs that states will have to pay the federal government for seniors who are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.Mr. President, I am also concerned about the millions of retirees that will lose their existing coverage. We have seen over the past few years that there has been a disturbing trend of reducing benefits for retirees. Creating this voluntary benefit will only accelerate this trend. The intent of the legislation is to expand prescription drug coverage for seniors, not merely to shift the financial burden of existing coverage to the federal government. Many seniors will be forced to rely on Medicare, which will provide a less generous benefit than what they currently enjoy. It is estimated that 17,850 Medicare beneficiaries in my home state of Hawaii will lose their retiree health benefits as a result of the enactment of this legislation. If Medicare beneficiaries lose their employer-based coverage, they may have to pay more for a Medicare drug benefit that provides less comprehensive coverage. Despite the subsidies included in the conference report to encourage the continuation of existing coverage, it is estimated that approximately 2.5 million people will lose their coverage.Mr. President, I along with Senators Warner, Allen, Mikulski, Sarbanes, Johnson, and Corzine requested that the conferees include our bill, S. 1369, in the conference report to ensure that present and future federal retirees receive the same level of prescription drug coverage. The government's Federal Employee Health Benefit (FEHBP) program for its employees and retirees stands as a model for all employer-sponsored health care plans. Our legislation would protect prescription drug benefits for federal retirees by ensuring parity for these benefits with other FEHBP subscribers. The other body approved companion legislation, H.R. 2631, on July 8, 2003. While the Medicare reform bill includes subsidies and tax credits to employers who retain existing drug benefits for their retirees, such incentives provide no guarantee of the FEHBP drug benefit for the government's own annuitants. If FEHBP is the model for this reform, the federal government must not drop or reduce drug benefits for retired FEHBP enrollees. Our legislation sends a message to other employer-sponsored plans that the federal government stands behind its commitment to retired workers. I will continue to work to bring about the enactment of this bill.Mr. President, the cost containment provisions in the legislation provide a fast-track legislative process to cut Medicare benefits if general revenue funding for the entire Medicare program exceeds 45 percent. This arbitrary process is included while more meaningful provisions to control the costs of prescription drugs were left out. The conference report prevents the federal government from using the bargaining power of 40 million senior citizens to bring down the cost of prescription drugs for the Medicare program.Mr. President, the conference report weakens Medicare. It imposes means tests for Medicare Part B premiums and for low-income subsidies for the prescription drug benefit. This is the beginning of the end of Medicare being as a universal benefit. This is the first step towards means testing other parts of the existing Medicare program. Means tests place greater burdens on seniors. They also create administrative difficulties for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Even more objectionable is the assets test used to determine the low-income subsidies for the prescription drug benefit. The assets test is completely unrealistic. According to Families USA, the assets test will deny subsidies to 2.8 million very low-income seniors if they have even a small amount of assets. For example, the assets test disqualifies people who have household goods and personal effects worth more than $2,000. Medicare is an entitlement and participants should not be subjected to these demeaning means tests. Additional assistance should not be denied because they happen to have set money aside for future expenses.Mr. President, this legislation also threatens existing Medicare benefits because it includes billions of dollars for subsidies for private plans. This increases premiums for seniors, raises government costs for health care, and damages the solvency of the Medicare trust fund.Mr. President, I also want to express my disappointment that language similar to an amendment that I had offered, which was accepted as part of the manager's package for S. 1, was not included in the conference report. While I thank Chairman Grassley and ranking member Baucus for their assistance with this provision, it was not included in the conference report. My amendment would have allowed my home state of Hawaii to benefit from the increase in Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments included in the bill. Medicaid DSH payments are designed to provide additional support to hospitals that treat large numbers of Medicaid and uninsured patients. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) created specific DSH allotments for each state based on their actual DSH expenditures for fiscal year 1995. In 1994, the State of Hawaii implemented the QUEST demonstration program that was designed to reduce the number of uninsured and improve access to health care. The prior Medicaid DSH program was incorporated into QUEST. As a result of the demonstration program, Hawaii did not have DSH expenditures in 1995 and was not provided a DSH allotment.The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 made further changes to the DSH program, which included the establishment of a floor for DSH allotments. However, states without allotments were again left out. Other states that have obtained waivers similar to Hawaii's waiver have retained their DSH allotments. Only two states, Hawaii and Tennessee, do not have DSH allotments.The conference report provides that states without DSH allotments could receive additional assistance if their waiver was terminated or removed. While this may possibly benefit Tennessee, this language will prevent Hawaii from obtaining any additional Medicaid DSH support that is included in this bill. The conference report includes an additional $6.35 billion in Medicaid DSH relief to the states. Hawaii does not receive any of these funds. Hawaii's hospitals are struggling to meet the healthcare needs of the uninsured. Hawaii cannot continue to be left out. Additional DSH payments would help Hawaii hospitals to meet the rising health care needs of our communities and reinforce our health care safety net. All fifty states need to have access to this additional Medicaid DSH support. I will continue to work to correct this inequity.Mr. President, as I said at the start of my remarks, this legislation is a false promise. Even if this conference report is enacted, we will need to enact follow up legislation to address the flaws in the bill. We will also have to repeal several of the provisions that weaken the existing Medicare program. Many have said this is an important step forward in the Medicare program. I disagree. This conference report takes too many elderly Americans backwards in terms of their benefits to constitute forward progress or forward thinking. Many people, particularly seniors, will eventually come to the conclusion that I have reached on the legislation and Congress will regret this rush to judgment. After reviewing the provisions in this legislation, I am disappointed that this bill is a false promise that undermines the existing Medicare program. Thank you, Mr. President.",

    "title": "UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII WAHINE SOCCER PLAYER NATASHA KAI",
    "text": "Mr. President, It is with great pride that I rise to recognize Natasha Kai of Kahuku, HI, for her extraordinary athletic achievements. As a forward for the University of Hawaii Rainbow Wahine soccer team, Natasha was recently named to the 2004 Women's Under 21 National Soccer team. This achievement marks the first time any female athlete from the State of Hawaii has acquired a position on this prestigious, nationally recognized team. After attending two training camps within the last month, Natasha competed amongst 40 of the country's top female athletes to earn a coveted spot on the national team.The national team is currently in China and competing in a tournament with the hopes of making it to the 2004 Nordic Cup, the premier tournament to be held in Iceland later this summer. A few days ago, the national team secured its first exhibition match win triumphing over the Shanghai SVA team. Natasha made her international debut during that match and scored the first goal within the first three minutes of play. The national team is off to a successful start and has two more exhibition matches before they return home.I am doubly proud that Natasha hails from Kahuku High School, which is one of the schools where I first entered the classroom as a teacher. As a multi-talented athlete at Kahuku, Natasha received four varsity letters each in soccer and track, as well as two in volleyball, and one each in basketball and cross country. Natasha was a two-time Oahu Interscholastic Association (OIA) All-Star soccer player, as well as a 2001 All-State player of the year. During her senior season, she led the Red Raider soccer team to a OIA division title win, a first for the school. Natasha earned State track and field honors in the 110 meter hurdles, high jump, and long jump, and was the two-time record holder and State champion in the 300 meter hurdles. In 2001, as a volleyball player she was voted to the OIA-East first team. Basketball accomplishments include being named to the OIA First-team and State Second-team that same year. In addition to her success on the field, Natasha also excelled in the classroom and was an honor student. As one of the most highly recruited female athletes in the State, Natasha decided to stay and pursue her athletic endeavors at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.As a forward on the soccer field, Natasha is known for her explosive speed and skill when evading defenders and scoring goals. During her freshman year with the UH Wahine Rainbow soccer team, she started 16 of the 17 games she appeared in and broke eight school records. Natasha was named the 2002 Western Athletic Conference (WAC) freshman of the year and WAC player of the year, and captured all-WAC first team honors. As a 2002 UH Scholar athlete, she was also selected for the Soccer Buzz freshman All-West region first team and All-American third team. The freshman scored two hat tricks against Tulsa and Boise State during conference play and was named WAC Offensive Player of the Week three times. Last season as a sophomore, Natasha led the Nation in scoring with 29 goals and again received her second WAC player of the year and All-American honors. With the help of this skilled athlete, UH won a record 13 matches and secured its first conference title in 2003.The athletic accolades of Natasha speak volumes of her character, love of the sport of soccer, and dedication to the game. I am confident that all the people of Hawaii, particularly her family and friends, take great pride in her great accomplishments. I wish Natasha and her teammates the best of luck while competing in the tournament and a safe journey home. Win or lose, I extend the support of the country and especially the support of all Hawaii. I thank Natasha for serving as a role model and for reminding us all that through hard work and determination, even what seems like a distant dream can be realized. ",

    "text": "Mr. President, I am proud to announce that the class from Kahuku High School of Kahuku, HI, will represent the State of Hawaii at the national finals of We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution. These Hawaii students will join the more than 1,200 students from across the country that will visit Washington, DC, to take part in the We the People national competition to be held during the first week of May. These outstanding students, through their knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won Hawaii's statewide competition and earned the chance to come to our Nation's Capital and compete at the national level.The We the People program is administered by the Center for Civic Education and is an extensive educational program developed specifically to educate young people about the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. The 3-day competition is modeled after hearings in the U.S. Congress and provides students with the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge before a panel of adult judges while they evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary issues. Their testimony is followed by questions designed to probe the students' depth of understanding and ability to apply their constitutional knowledge.I would like to recognize the following 25 Kahuku students that will be representing the State of Hawaii: Samuel Braden, Chelsey Bunker, Stacia Colton, Brian Craycroft, Tusi Esera, Lacey Golonka, Evelyn Griffin, Reis Harney, Celesta Hubner, Jeremy James, Natalie Kamauoha, Jennifer Kamiya, Azura Iversen-Keahi, Tiffany Lee, Brook McArthur, Donna Ramos, Leilani Relator, Alicia Reidy, Aaron Rillamas, Jordan Williams, Austin Spring, Ian Tapu, Alexandra Thompson, Rachel Tolleson, and Seini Unga. I would especially like to thank their teacher, Ms. Sandra Cashman, for once again seizing this opportunity to empower and educate students about the significance of the American institutions of constitutional democracy. I am confident that the students will step up to the challenges presented in this competition and they will give a stellar performance.As one who formerly taught at Kahuku High School, I take a special pride in these students' accomplishments. I know that it is because of school and parental support, dedication, and commitment that these students were empowered and encouraged to excel in this arena. I wish these students the best of luck at the We the People national finals and applaud their achievement. These students have no doubt made everyone in their school, their families, and their friends proud of what they have achieved. We should all be proud that they are learning and advocating the fundamental ideas that identify us as a people and bind us together as a nation. Let the students' enthusiasm and active participation in shaping their understanding of government serve as a model for all citizens to follow. ",

    "title": "STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pet Safety and Protection Act. My legislation amends the Animal Welfare Act to ensure that all companion animals such as dogs and cats used by research facilities are obtained legally.Over 30 years ago, Congress passed the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to set and enforce standards protecting animals used in biomedical research, bred for commercial sale, exhibited to the public, or commercially transported from inhumane treatment. Despite the well-meaning intentions of the AWA and the enforcement efforts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Act fails to provide reliable protection against the actions of some unethical animal dealers.Under the AWA, Class B animal dealers are defined as individuals whose business includes the purchase, sale, or transport of animals in commerce, including dogs and cats intended for use at research facilities. To the dismay of animal welfare advocates and pet owners, some Class B, or ``random source,'' dealers have resorted to theft and deception to collect animals for resale. In many instances these animals were found living under inhumane conditions.As recently as August of 2003, USDA agents executed a warrant to investigate a Class B dealer from Arkansas suspected of violations of the AWA for the second time in several years. Many claims have been levied against this dealer, and approximately 125 dogs were seized by Federal agents during this week-long search. The investigation of this facility is ongoing, and an indictment is pending.The complaint being investigated by the USDA against the dealer alleges that the respondents' veterinarian provided for them falsified official health certificates for cats and dogs, and also provided them with blank, undated, and signed health certificates. It is also alleged that the dealer failed to provide the barest standards of care, husbandry, and housing for the animals on the premises. The undercover investigation of this facility has revealed that its proprietors were aware that some of the companion animals brought to the facility were stolen, and also revealed a list of over 50 ``bunchers,'' individuals who obtain animals and sell them to ``random source'' animal dealers. Bunchers have a variety of methods of obtaining companion animals, including responding to newspaper ads offering free animals, trespassing on private property to abduct the animals from yards, and house burglaries. Inadequate veterinary care is one of the worst violations of the AWA committed against these animals. The expense for quality veterinary care is one that irresponsible Class B dealers do not wish to incur, and animals often die as a result of their untreated injuries or diseases. This was one of the violations uncovered by the investigation, and often resulted from another violation of the AWA that requires compatible grouping of animals. Vicious or diseased animals were not separated from the general population and posed a risk to all of the animals housed with them. In addition, this particular dealer also provided inadequate housing facilities that exposed the animals to injury from sharp wires. Fecal waste was allowed to accumulate in the housing facility, and often dead dogs were left where they fell in cages with other living animals. Food receptacles were found to be contaminated with moldy and rotten food, and potable water was not readily available to the animals. All of these are direct violations of the Animal Welfare Act. In addition to neglect, these animals often suffer abuse at the hands of dealers. Evidence of gross cruelty is being uncovered while the USDA continues to investigate this case.The Pet Safety and Protection Act strengthens the AWA by prohibiting the use of Class B dealers as suppliers of dogs and cats to research laboratories. My legislation would not be a burden on research facilities because only two percent of the approximately 2,051 Class B dealers in the United States currently sell cats and dogs to research facilities. I am not here to argue whether animals should or should not be used in research. Medical research is an invaluable weapon in the battle against disease. New drugs and surgical techniques offer promise in the fight against cancer, Alzheimer's, tuberculosis, AIDS, and a host of other life-threatening diseases. Animal research has been, and continues to be, fundamental to advancements in medicine. However, I am concerned with the sale of stolen pets and stray animals to research facilities and the poor treatment of these animals by some Class B dealers.My legislation preserves the integrity of animal research by encouraging research laboratories to obtain animals from legitimate sources that comply with the AWA. Legitimate sources for animals include USDA-licensed Class A dealers, breeders, and research facilities, municipal pounds and shelters, and legitimate pet owners who want to donate their animals to research. These sources are capable of meeting the demand for research animals. The National Institutes of Health, in an effort to curb abuse and deception, have already adopted policies against the acquisition of dogs and cats from Class B dealers.The Pet Safety and Protection Act also reduces the Department of Agriculture's regulatory burden by allowing the Department to use its resources more efficiently and effectively. Each year, thousands of dollars are spent on regulating dealers. To discourage any future violations of the AWA, my bill increases the penalties to a minimum of $1,000 per violation.I reiterate that this bill in no way impairs or impedes research, but will end the fraudulent practices of some Class B dealers, as well as the unnecessary suffering of these animals in their care. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.",

    "title": "DISCLOSING GOVERNMENT WRONGDOING",
    "text": "Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to those public servants who step forward to disclose government waste, fraud, and abuse. Commonly called whistleblowers, these individuals alert Congress and the public to threats to health, waste of taxpayer money, and other information vital to running an effective and efficient government. While there are protections in place for Federal employees who disclose government wrongdoing, certain legal decisions prevent many from coming forward. To underscore the importance of whistleblowers, Time Magazine called 2002 the ``Year of the Whistleblowers'' because of the bravery of FBI Agent Colleen Rowley, who alerted Congress to serious institutional problems at the FBI, and Sherron Watkins and Cynthia Cooper, who blew the whistle on financial mismanagement at Enron and WorldCom, respectively. Today, as in 2002, it is important that during Public Service Recognition Week we acknowledge those who disclose information without assurances of protection and pledge to do what we can to provide full protection for those trusted public servants.Congress has a duty to taxpayers to make informed decisions when carrying out its legislative, appropriation, and oversight functions. Such decisions require access to timely and accurate information, and when access is restricted, we are unable to provide oversight and fulfill our constitutional responsibilities. Only through a credible, functioning statute can we protect the rights of Federal workers who wish to communicate with Congress. Guaranteeing freedom from retaliation or abuse when disclosing critical information to Congress is the underpinning of the Whistleblower Protection Act, WPA.Congress has worked hard, and continues to work, to provide real whistleblower protection to Federal employees. Unfortunately, through a series of decisions contrary to both statutory language and congressional intent, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which has sole appellate review for the WPA, has denied full whistleblower protections to Federal workers and harmed Congress's ability to do its job. In fact, of the 85 retaliation cases decided on the merits since 1994, the Federal circuit has ruled for the whistleblower only once.To ensure continued whistleblower protection, I introduced S. 1358, the Federal Employee Protection of Disclosures Act, on June 26, 2003, with Senators Grassley, Levin, Leahy, and Durbin. Since introduction, we have been joined by Senators Dayton, Pryor, and Johnson. Our bill would strengthen protections for Federal employees who report government waste, fraud, abuse, gross mismanagement, and substantial and specific dangers to public health and safety.Congress has consistently supported the principle that Federal employees should not be subject to prior restraint from disclosing wrongdoing. For example, every year since 1988 Congress has included in every Transportation, Treasury, and General Government Appropriations bill an ``anti-gag'' provision which prohibits the use of Federal funds to implement nondisclosure policies that are inconsistent with several open government statutes, such as the WPA of 1989 as amended in 1994, the Military Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998, and the Lloyd Lafollette Act of 1912, which prohibits discrimination against government employees who communicate with Congress.However, more must be done. Since we introduced our bill there have been several more public reports of Federal employees allegedly being fired or threatened with termination or other retaliation for communicating with Congress and disclosing government wrongdoing to the press. These reports include the controversy surrounding the U.S. Park Police and cost estimates for the newly enacted Medicare prescription drug program. In order to aid these and other employees and provide full protection to Federal whistleblowers, S. 1358 would codify the ``anti-gag'' provision and allow employees to bring cases seeking remedial action for retaliation before the Merit Systems Protection Board, MSPB, an independent, quasi-judicial agency that adjudicates Federal employee appeals.In addition, our bill, the Federal Employee Protection of Disclosures Act, would overturn certain Federal Circuit decisions which have denied protection to employees who made disclosures in the course of their job duties or reported initially to the wrongdoer or a coworker. S. 1358 would also suspend the Federal Circuit's exclusive jurisdiction over WPA reprisal cases for 5 years, and overturn the wrongly established ``irrefragable proof'' standard imposed by the Federal circuit for whistleblowers to qualify for protection.Although much press has been given to recent whistleblower cases, it is important to remember those who have reported allegations of aircraft maintenance violations, water safety regulations, and lapses in our national security. Protecting Federal employees who blow the whistle allows us to protect taxpayers and, in recent notable instances, national security as well. That is why the WPA is often referred to as the Taxpayer Protection Act.During Public Service Recognition Week, I urge my colleagues to remember public servants who have come forward and honor them by supporting S. 1358 and strengthening protections for whistleblowers.",

    "title": "ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH",
    "text": "Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community and commemorate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. As a member of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, the only Chinese American in the U.S. Senate, and sole Native Hawaiian in the U.S. Congress, I am proud to stand here to honor the accomplishments and diversity of the AAPI community.In 1978, my friends and dear colleagues Representatives Frank Horton and Norman Mineta, joined by Hawaii's Senators Daniel K. Inouye and Spark Matsunaga, introduced the first resolutions establishing Asian Pacific American Heritage Week to recognize the ongoing contributions to our Nation of the AAPI population. Representatives Horton and Mineta worked with their colleagues in the 102nd Congress to make Asian Pacific American Heritage Week a month-long celebration, and succeeded in doing so with enactment of Public Law 102-450 in 1992. I look back with pride over the past 25 years since our great Nation first observed Asian Pacific American Heritage Week.Throughout this month, Federal agencies and AAPI and other organizations will hold events in celebration of the diversity of the AAPI population that range from samplings of Asian cuisines to dance, and policy lectures by distinguished speakers. Each event demonstrates the contributions that AAPI individuals have made to our country. I commend agencies and organizations for sponsoring such events to increase public awareness of the contributions made by the AAPI community.This month presents us with a good opportunity to reexamine the need to increase AAPI participation in our Federal Government. I encourage the President to renew Executive Order 13216, the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, which expired on June 7, 2003. The Commission is mandated to develop, monitor, and coordinate Federal efforts to improve AAPI participation in Government programs; foster research and data collection for AAPI populations and sub-populations; and increase public and private sector and community involvement in improving the health and well-being of the AAPI community. AAPI citizens, whether employed in the private and public sector, deserve the coordination of services that the Commission can facilitate.Our celebration of AAPI history includes remembrances of the challenges and hardships that have been overcome. For example, we will never forget the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. At the newly opened Manzanar National Historic Site Interpretive Center at the Manzanar War Relocation Center, we have an opportunity to explore our past and reflect. The AAPI community, specifically the Japanese American National Museum and Japanese American Citizens League, are exploring ways to preserve and recall history at the other sites that mark this traumatic time in our country's history in an effort to ensure that such actions do not repeat themselves.This month also affords us time to reflect on the various social needs that exist in the AAPI community. Its population enriches our culture linguistically through a range of languages, such as Chinese, Hawaiian, Korean, Japanese, Malay, Samoan, Tamil, Thai, Vietnamese, and various Melanesian, Micronesian, and Polynesian languages. Our Nation benefits from this linguistic diversity in our ability to compete in the global economy, and U.S. national security is strengthened by increasing the pool of individuals fluent in critical languages. Fluency in foreign languages is one of the vital skills necessary for the United States to exercise international leadership economically and politically. However, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, slightly less than half of the 7 million AAPI who speak a language other than English at home report that they speak English ``very well.'' We need to better address the educational needs of all limited English proficiency students, children, and adults.I want to extend my gratitude to the patriotic men and women serving our country in the military, including the 60,813 Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders serving on active duty in the U.S. Armed Services, as well as the 28,066 in the Reserves and National Guard. I also commend the 351,000 AAPI veterans, 57,000 of whom are of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander heritage, for their excellence in defending our nation.In addition, individual achievements among the AAPI population are many. Though impossible to enumerate all those extraordinary individuals, I would like to cite a few examples.Army Specialist Hilario Bermanis of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division was presented with the Bronze Star and Purple Heart for Meritorious Conduct in Operation Iraqi Freedom. On July 16, 2003, the award presentation ceremony took place bedside at Walter Reed Army Medical Center where he was convalescing from grave injuries. Specialist Bermanis and a fellow soldier were on guard duty in southern Baghdad when they sustained an attack by rocket propelled grenades on June 10, 2003. His fellow soldier died instantly and Specialist Bermanis lost both legs and his left hand. Officials from the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the U.S. Government have visited him at Walter Reed and praised him for his courage and exemplary service. A senior U.S. official commended Specialist Bermanis's service as representative of FSM citizens' commitment to the security of the United States and Pacific region. Specialist Bermanis hails from Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia.Dr. Yuan-Cheng Fung, the recipient of the Chinese Institute of Engineers' Distinguished Life Time Achievement Award, is a pioneer in bioengineering and founder of the University of California, San Diego's bioengineering department. Born in China in 1919, Dr. Fung began his career as an aeronautics engineer working for the Chinese government. Dr. Fung received his Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology in 1948, where he became a faculty member and a major contributor to the field of aeroelasticity. When his mother developed glaucoma, Dr. Fung's interests shifted to medical science. Combining an expertise in force and motion from aeronautics with physiology, he synthesized a new understanding of how the body functions and became the father of biomechanics.Lauren Moriarty, a Native Hawaiian, is a career member of the Senior Foreign Service and was confirmed for the rank of Ambassador to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, where she was recently the U.S. Senior Official. Having previously served in Beijing and Taipei, Ms. Moriarty led the Economic Sections at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, China (1999-2001) and the American Institute in Taiwan (1994-1997) as those two economies completed negotiations to accede to the World Trade Organization. She has received numerous awards, including the State Department's 1993 Arnold L. Raphel Award for her leadership and mentoring of her subordinates.Indra K. Nooyi is the widely admired President and Chief Financial Officer for PepsiCo and highest ranking Indian-born woman in corporate America. Upon emigrating to the United States in 1978, Ms. Nooyi entered the Yale School of Management. She worked from midnight to five in the morning to support herself at school. A firm believer in human potential and an advocate of education, Ms. Nooyi has received awards for her dedication to human capital management. She is ranked by Fortune magazine as one of America's top 50 most powerful women.AAPI cultural and linguistic diversity, entrepreneurship, public service, and scientific endeavors illustrate a number of the ways that our Nation excels. The United States is the most energetic and innovative country because of the combination of these AAPI strengths with the diverse abilities and skills of our Nation's other ethnic and racial groups. The U.S. is also a leader in the world because of our ability to acknowledge, celebrate, and utilize the potency of our combined, diverse citizenry, including the contributions from every member of our AAPI community. In the world that is all too frequently wracked by ethnic and religious conflicts, we can demonstrate to others how racial and ethnic harmony in the U.S. provides a balance that encourages a stable democracy, provides for well-functioning societies, and sustains the most powerful economy in the world.In closing, I extend my deepest aloha to all in celebration of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, and I urge my colleagues to participate in commemorations of this month in their States and our Nation's Capital.I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "title": "RECOGNIZING HAWAII PARTICIPANTS IN 2004 ECONOMICS CHALLENGE",
    "text": "Mr. President, today I congratulate the team of students from Iolani School of Honolulu, HI, for logging a national accomplishment in the National Economics Challenge recently held in New York City. The team traveled over 5,000 miles to represent not only Hawaii, but the western region in the competition, at which they achieved a second-place finish in their category, the David Ricardo division, which is for students enrolled in single-semester economics courses.The National Economics Challenge is sponsored by the National Council on Economic Education, NCEE, and the Goldman Sachs Foundation, which created the Challenge in 2000 to promote student interest in economics, reinforce classroom instruction, advance academics, and reward scholarship. Preliminary rounds began in April with more than 3,600 students on over 700 teams participating in 33 State and 4 regional competitions. I commend the Hawaii Council on Economic Education for sponsoring the State-level competition in my State and, on a constant basis, training teachers and working to improve economic and financial literacy in Hawaii's schools. Student teams in the final round at the national level faced difficult questions on complex economic concepts and theories involving microeconomics, macroeconomics, international economics, and current events. The final round of the competition was held before a crowd of hundreds at the New York High School of Economics and Finance in Manhattan. The Iolani team competed and placed second in their division, for which I congratulate them wholeheartedly.As a former teacher and principal, I am aware of the many hours of work that these students dedicated to develop the necessary knowledge to participate in this national competition. They have surmounted many challenges at the State, regional and national levels, and have emerged with not only a placing finish to show for it, but also the experiences and memories of all they have learned along the way. Economic and financial education are crucial components needed to build our future leaders, and I applaud all students who participate in this competition for their hard work.I am pleased to enter the names of the Iolani team members for the Record: Stephani Le, Kimberlee Collins, Kyle Sombrero, and Brando Inouye. I also take this opportunity to recognize their coach Richie Kibota for his contributions in helping the Iolani team prepare for the national competition. Of particular interest are their classmates and peers who rose to the same challenges, whose names I would also like to enter into the Record. This includes another Iolani School team who competed and placed at both State and regional levels in the Adam Smith division for advanced placement, international baccalaureate, and honors students, with team members Jeffrey Lawi, Brad Kawitaki, Ronald Kwok, Keone Nakoa, and Krystal Ching, and coach Dick Rankin. Also included are other Hawaii State participants: a third team from Iolani School and other teams from Kamehameha Schools, Maryknoll School, Kaimuki High School, and Nanakuli High and Intermediate School.Again, I congratulate the students and the faculty of Iolani School, and I join the people of Hawaii in expressing my pride in their impressive achievements. It is these types of efforts that are supported by the Excellence in Economic Education Act, and these kinds of efforts that will ensure that our students and future leaders have the tools they need to make wise economic and financial decisions.",

    "title": "RECOGNIZING KAHUKU HIGH SCHOOL ``WE THE PEOPLE'' TEAM",
    "text": "Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure and pride to announce that students from Kahuku High School, on the Island of Oahu, honorably represented Hawaii at the national finals of ``We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution.'' These Hawaii students joined more than 1,200 students from across the country to visit Washington, DC, and take part in national competition during the first week of May. These bright students showcased their exemplary knowledge of the U.S. Consitution, and did my State proud against competition from other States. I applaud the achievement of the Kahuku students for placing in the Top 10 of National Finalists out of the 51 schools participating.The ``We the People'' program is administered by the Center for Civic Education and is an extensive educational program developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and Bill of Rights. The 3-day competition is modeled after hearings in the U.S. Congress and provides students with the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge before a panel of adult judges while they evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary issues. Their testimony is followed by questions designed to probe the students' depth of understanding and ability to apply their constitutional knowledge.I recognize the following 23 Kahuku students who proudly represented the State of Hawaii: Genevieve Allen, Yesenia Arevalo, Amanda Baize, Bonnie Cameron, Meri Ching, Dannah Christensen, Krystle Corpuz, Oliver Howells, Lorna Kekua, Jokke Kokkonen, Jacquelyn Lautaha, William Law, Catalina Markowitz, Ajri McArthur, Sara Mirels, Brad Rasmussen, Ashley Rillamas, Lizette Sauque, Noelle Spring, Shirly Tagayuna, Joseph Trisolini, and Morgan Wright. I especially thank their teacher, Ms. Sandra Cashman, for once again seizing this opportunity to educate students about the significance of the American institutions of constitutional democracy. The mere fact that Kahuku students competed here for 11 of the last 12 ``We the People'' competitions is a testament to Ms. Cashman's skills as a civics education teacher.As a former Kahuku High School teacher, I take pride in these students who rose to the challenges presented in this competition, and gave impressive performances. I know that it is because of school and parental support, dedication, and commitment that these students were empowered and encouraged to excel in this arena. These students have no doubt made everyone in their school, their families, and their friends proud of what they achieved. We should all recognize that they are learning and advocating the fundamental ideas that identify us as a people and bind us together as a nation. The zeal and diligence these students showed in their understanding of Government ought to serve as a symbol for all citizens to pursue. ",

    "title": "RECOGNIZING THE 15TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT",
    "text": "Mr. President, I join my colleagues in commemorating the 15th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I thank my friend from Iowa, Senator Harkin, for sponsoring a resolution recounting the history and accomplishments under this landmark act for countless individuals in the United States. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this resolution.The enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, on July 26, 1990, was a milestone and continues to serve the more than 54 million individuals with disabilities in our country today. These individuals are now able to better participate in society thanks to the removal of barriers in areas such as employment, transportation, public services, telecommunications, and public accommodations under the ADA. Prior to the passage of the act, it was much more common for disabled Americans to encounter prejudice, discrimination, and physical exclusion in their everyday lives. The Americans with Disabilities Act marks the culmination of a civil rights movement that keeps faith with the spirit of our forefathers, who believed in the unalienable rights of all individuals.Under the ADA, my home State has become a leader in providing new and updated facilities for individuals with disabilities. An estimated 148,000 people in Hawaii are living with a disability, and an estimated 22,000 people have difficulty performing self-care activities, such as dressing, bathing, or mobility inside the home according to the 2003 American Community Survey.Since the passage of the ADA, Hawaii has modified more than 5,000 curb ramps and built 3,000 new curb ramps for better accessibility throughout the State. No one should be denied access to buses, sidewalks, or parks, and I am pleased to say that Hawaii is one of the leaders in ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate in society. By next year, Hawaii's public sector will be almost 100-percent accessible and, as of today, 70 percent of the private sector has addressed or is addressing the needs of the disabled, according to a nationally recognized ADA consultant.I join the more than 40 million disabled Americans who have been helped by the ADA in saying mahalo to those who championed this historic piece of legislation. In particular, the tireless efforts of Justin Dart, Jr. His courage and dedication as a disability rights advocate is exemplary in protecting the civil rights of disabled Americans. Mr. Dart has inspired future generations of disabled Americans to reach their full potential as active and engaged members of society.The work of my fellow Senators Harkin and Kennedy in the Senate, as well as Representative Hoyer in the House, must also be recognized in addition to everyone else who pushed for this legislation. It was my great privilege to vote in favor of the conference report when it passed in the Senate on July 13, 1990. Our collaborative work in Congress to push the ADA through to passage showed a strong commitment to civil rights and equality. Millions of Americans are forever grateful for the chance they now have to live a better life.",

    "title": "BLACK HISTORY MONTH",
    "text": "Mr. President, it was 80 years ago when we first recognized February as Black History Month. Today, I am pleased to rise to add my voice to those honoring African Americans.African Americans have both a tragic and vibrant history in the United States. This month is an opportunity to reflect upon their struggles, perseverance, and triumphs. African Americans have contributed to every segment of our community, ranging from politics and sports to medicine and business--and have greatly impacted the music industry. Our society continues to benefit from their service as national leaders, role models, athletes, scholars, and much more.As you know, we cannot reflect on the achievements of our friends without remembering the civil rights movement. I vividly remember the movement's powerful call for nonviolent change. In 1963, my brother, Rev. Abraham Akaka, joined Dr. King for the famous March on Washington to help show Hawaii's support for the movement. Since 1926, Americans have dedicated the month to honoring the African American legacy. As a staunch supporter of civil rights, I am proud of the many ways that our country has evolved into a more fair and just nation since the movement.Earlier this week, we bid a fond farewell to Coretta Scott King, who, along with her husband Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., carried the torch against discrimination and bigotry everywhere. As a nation, we are indebted to the Kings and their life's work, and the work of countless other civil rights leaders. However, it is an unfortunate reality that, despite all of this progress, inequities remain. To properly pay tribute to their legacy, I believe that it is important that we use this month not just as a time for reflection, but also as a springboard for action.In looking back at the progress of African Americans throughout the years and how it has changed the face of our Nation, it is clear that Black history is American history. As a nation, we must work together to close the gap on these important issues. Where possible, we must work in our communities on a local level, to ensure that all members of our society have equal opportunities to thrive and succeed.This is also a national problem that requires a refocusing of national legislative priorities. Earlier this week, President Bush released his budget for fiscal year 2007, and I was disappointed that he did not devote the proper resources to these fundamental issues. President Bush's budget once again underfunds important health care and education priorities. It saddens me that so many people will be negatively affected by the President's proposals. Unfortunately, the administration has again demonstrated a disregard for domestic programs to improve the lives of working people at the expense of tax cuts for the wealthiest.The administration needs to refocus its priorities. There are a variety of legislative initiatives that have been introduced this Congress which will address the shortcomings in education and health care for minorities, including African Americans. Earlier this year, I introduced S. 1580--the Healthcare Equality and Accountability Act--which establishes programs designed to improve the quality of and access to health care for minorities, while also improving health workforce accountability. My bill also includes a comprehensive diabetes education program. Diabetes is a disease that disproportionately impacts African Americans and other minorities such as native Hawaiians.As a former teacher, I have seen the ways that education can open doors for people from all walks of life. For that reason, I also introduced S. 1521, the Teacher Acculturation Act of 2005. This bill recognizes that cultural incongruence along racial, socioeconomic, and ethnic vectors impedes learning in our classrooms. Too often, this makes it difficult for knowledge that needs to be transmitted between students aiming to learn and teachers seeking to teach. My bill helps teachers implement strategies to create a healthy learning environment for all students.I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me in support of my bills, which address significant gaps in services for minorities and African Americans. I am proud to stand with my Democratic colleagues in working to support and empower African Americans in addressing important issues like education, health care, and the economy. As we move through the month of February, I am hopeful that we can work together to make America a better place for all Americans.",
